    "### Now that we can run tf-idf with plain Python, we can learn how to run it using other libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover how to run exactly the same process as in the Session 4 notebook, but using SciKit Learn and pandas instead. You'll need to install these on the command line using `pip install libraryname` before you begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll mostly follow the techniques of [the Programming Historian tutorial on tf-idf](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/analyzing-documents-with-tfidf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping your head around these libraries takes a little work, but it's ultimately much easier than doing the calculations yourself. As we move to more advanced calculations, doing so would be almost impossible, so it's worth figuring out SKLearn now."

look and read the sorrows of my dying spright written with tears in hearts close bleeding book and happy rhymes bathed in the sacred brook of helicon whence she derived is when you behold that angels blessed look my souls long lacked food my heavens bliss leaves lines and rhymes seek her to please alone whom if you please i care for other none sonnet ii unquiet thought whom at the first i bred of inward bale of my love pined heart and since have with sighs and sorrows fed till greater then my womb thou waxed art break forth at length out of the inner part in which thou lurkest like to vipers brood and seek some succour both to ease my smart and also to sustain thy self with food but if in presence of that fairest proud thou chance to come fallen lowly at her feet and with meek humbleness and afflicted mood pardon for thee and grace for me entreat which if she grant then live and my love cherish if not die soon and i with thee will perish sonnet iii the sovereign beauty which i do admire witness the world how worthy to be prayzed the light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire in my frail spirit by her from baseness raised that being now with her huge brightness dazed base thing i can no more endure to view but looking still on her i stand amazed at wondrous sighed of so celestial hew so when my tongue would speak her praises due it stopped is with thoughts astonishment and when my pen would write her titles true it ravished is with fancies wonderment yet in my heart i then both speak and write the wonder that my wit cannot endite sonnet iiii new year forth looking out of ianus gate does seem to promise hope of new delight and bidding th'old adieu his passed date bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish spright and calling forth out of sad winter's night fresh love that long hath slept in cheerless bower wills him awake and soon about him dight his wanton wings and darts of deadly power for lusty spring now in his timely hour is ready to come forth him to receive and warns the earth with diverse colord flower to deck his self and her fair mantle weave then you fair flower in whom fresh youth does rain prepare your self new love to entertain sonnet v. rudely thou wrongest my deer hearts desire in finding fault with her too portly pride the thing which i do most in her admire is of the world unworthy most envied for in those lofty looks is close implide scorn of base things & disdain of foul dishonour threatening rash eyes which gaze on her so wide that loosely they ne dare to look upon her such pride is praise such portliness is honour that boldened innocence bears in his eyes and her fair countenance like a goodly banner spreads in defiance of all enemies was never in this world ought worthy tried without some spark of such self-pleasing pride sonnet vi be nought dismayed that her unmoved mind does still persist in her rebellious pride such love not like to lustest of baser kind the harder won the firmer will abide the duresull oak whose sap is not yet dried is long ere it conceive the kindling fire but when it once does burn it does divide great heat and makes his flames to heaven aspire so hard it is to kindle new desire in gentle breast that shall endure for ever deep is the wound that dints the parts entire with chaste affects that nought but death can sever then think not long in taking little pain to knit the knot that ever shall remain sonnet vii fair eyes the mirror of my mazed heart what wondrous virtue is contained in you the which both life and death forth from you dart into the object of your mighty view for when you mildly look with lovely hew then is my soul with life and love inspired but when you lower or look on me askew then do i die as one with lightning fired but since that life is more then death desired look ever lovely as becomes you best that your bright beams of my weak eyes admired may kindle living fire within my breast such life should be the honour of your light such death the sad ensample of your might sonnet viii more then most fair full of the living fire kindled above unto the maker near no eyes but joys in which all powers conspire that to the world nought else be counted deer through your bright beams does not the blinded guest shoot out his darts to base affections wound but angels come to led frail minds to rest in chaste desires on heavenly beauty bound you frame my thoughts and fashion me within you stop my tongue and teach my heart to speak you calm the storm that passion did begin strong through your cause but by your virtue weak dark is the world where your light shined never well is he born that may behold you ever sonnet ix long-while i sought to what i might compare those powerful eyes which lighten my dark spright yet find i nought on earth to which i dare resemble image of their goodly light not to the sun for they do shine by night nor to the moon for they are changed never nor to the stars for they have purer sighed nor to the fire for they consume not ever nor to the lightning for they still persever nor to the diamond for they are more tender nor unto crystal for nought may them sever nor unto glass such baseness might offend her then to the maker self they likest be whose light does lighten all that here we see sonnet x. unrighteous lord of love what law is this that me thou makest thus tormented be the while she lordeth in licentious bliss of her freewill scorning both thee and me see how the tyranness does joy to see the huge massacres which her eyes do make and humbled hearts brings captives unto thee that thou of them mayest mighty vengeance take but her proud heart do thou a little shake and that high look with which she does comptrol all this world's pride bow to a baser make and all her faults in thy black book enrol that i may laugh at her in equal sort as she does laugh at me & makes my pain her sport sonnet xi dayly when i do seek and sew for peace and hostages do offer for my truth she cruel warrior does her self address to battle and the weary war reneweth ne will moved with reason or with rewth to grant small respite to my restless toil but greedily her fell intent poursewth of my poor life to make vnpitteid spoil yet my poor life all sorrows to assoil i would her yield her wrath to pacify but then she seeks with torment and turmoil to force me live and will not let me die all pain hath end and every war hath peace but mine no price nor prayer may surcease sonnet xii one day i sought with her heart-thrilling eyes to make a truce and terms to entertain all fearless then of so false enemies which sought me to entrap in treasons train so as i then disarmed did remain a wicked ambush which lay hidden long in the close covert of her guileful eyes thence breaking forth did thick about me throng too feeble i abide the brunt so strong was forced to yield my self into their hands who me captiuing straight with rigorous wrong have ever since me kept in cruel bans so lady now to you i do complain against your eyes that justice i may gain sonnet xiii in that proud port which her so goodly graceth while her fair face she rears up to the sky and to the ground her eye lids low embaseth most goodly temperature you may descry mild humbleness mixed with awful majesty for looking on the earth whence she was born her mind remember her mortality what so is fairest shall to earth return but that same lofty countenance seems to scorn base thing & think how she to heaven may climb treading down earth as loathsome and forlorn that hinders heavenly thoughts with drossy slime yet lowly still vouchsafe to look on me such lowliness shall make you lofty be sonnet xiiii retourne again my forces late dismayed unto the siege by you abandoned quite great shame it is to leave like one afraid so fair a piece for one repulse so light gainst such strong castles needs greater might then those small forts which you were wont belay such haughty minds enured to hardy fight disdain to yield unto the first assay bring therefore all the forces that you may and lay incessant battery to her heart plaints prayers vows ruth sorrow and dismay those engines can the proudest love convert and if those fail fallen down and die before her so dying live and living do adore her sonnet xv you tradeful merchant's that with weary toil do seek most precious things to make your ga and both the indias of their treasures spoil what needs you to seek so far in vain for lo my love does in her self contain all this world's riches that may far be found if sapphires lo her eyes be sapphires plain if rubies lo his lips be rubies found if pearls his teeth be pearls both pure and round if ivory her forehead ivory ween if gold her locks are finest gold on ground if silver her fair hands are silver sheen but that which fairest is but few behold her mind adorned with virtues manifold sonnet xvi one day as i unwarily did gaze on those fair eyes my loves immortal light the while my astonished heart stood in amaze through sweet illusion of her looks delight i mote perceive how in her glancing sighed legions of loves with little wings did fly darting their deadly arrows fyry bright at every rash beholder passing by one of those archers closely i did spy aiming his arrow at my very heart when suddenly with twincle of her eye the damosel broke his misintended dart had she not so done sure i had be slain yet as it was i hardly scaped with pain sonnet xvii the glorious portrait of that angels face made to amaze weak men's confused skill and this world's worthless glory to embase what pen what pencil can express her fill for though he colours could devise at will and eke his learned hand at pleasure guide lest trembling it his workmanship should spill yet many wondrous things there are beside the sweet eye-glaunces that like arrows glide the charming smiles that rob sense from the heart the lovely pleasance and the lofty pride cannot expressed be by any art a greater craftsmans hand thereto does need that can express the life of things indeed sonnet xviii the rolling wheel that runneth often round the hardest steel in tract of time does tear and drizzling drops that often do redound the firmest flint does in continuance wear yet cannot i with many a dropping tear and long entreaty soften her hard heart that she will once vouchsafe my plaint to hear or look with pity on my payneful smart but when i plead she bids me play my part and when i weep she says tears are but water and when i sighs she says i know the art and when i wail she turns his self to laughter so do i weep and wail and plead in vain while she as steel and flint does still remain sonnet xix the merry cuckoo messenger of spring his trumpet shrill hath thrice already sounded that warns all lovers wait upon their king who now is coming forth with girl and crowned with noise whereof the quire of birds resounded their anthems sweet devised of loves praise that all the woods their echos back rebounded as if they knew the meaning of their lays but amongst them all which did loves honour raise no word was herd of her that most it ought but she his precept proudly disobeys and does his idle message set at nought therefore oh love unless she turn to thee ere cuckoo end let her a rebel be sonnet xx in vain i seek and sew to her for grace and do mne humbled heart before her pour the while her foot she in my neck does place and tread my life down in the lowly flower and yet the lion that is lord of power and reigneth over every beast in field in his most pride disdeigneth to devour the silly lamb that to his might does yield but she more cruel and more salvage wild then either lion or the lonesse shames not to be with guiltless blood defylde but takes glor in her cruelness fairer then fairest let none ever say that you were blooded in a yielded prey sonnet xxi was it the work of nature or of art which tempered so the featur of her face that pride and meekness mixed by equal par do both appear adorn her beauty's grace for with mild pleasnce which does pride displace she to her loves does lookers eyes allure & with stern countenance back again does chase their looser looks that stir up lusts impure with such strange terms her eyes she does inure that with one look she does my life dismay and with another does it straight reure her smile me draws her frown me drives away thus does she train and teach me with her looks such art of eyes i never read in books sonnet xxii this holy season fit to fast and pray men to devotion ought to be inclynd therefore i likewise on so holy day for my sweet saint some service fit will find her temple fair is built within my mind in which her glorious image placed is on which my thoughts do day and night attend like sacred priests that never think amiss there i to her as author of my bliss will build and altar to appease her ire and on the same my heart will sacrifice burning in flames of pure and chaste desire the which vouchsafe o goddess to accept among thy dearest relics to be kept sonnet xxiii penelope for her vlisses sake devise a web her wooers to deceive in which the work that she all day did make the same at night she did again unreave such subtle craft my damosel does conceive that ` importune suit of my desire to shun for all that i in many days do weave in one short hour i find by her undone so when i think to end that i begun i must begin and never bring to end for with one look she spills that long i spun & with one word my whole years work does rend such labour like the spiders web i find whose fruitless work is broken with least wind sonnet xxiiii when i behold that beauty's wonderment and rare perfection of each goodly part of nature's skill the only compliment i honour and admire the makers art but when i feel the bitter baleful smart which her fair eyes unwares do work in me that death out of their shiny beams do dart i think that i a new pandora see whom all the gods in council did agree into this sinful world from heaven to send that she to wicked men a scourge should be for all their aults with which they did offend but since you are my scourge i will entreat that for my faults you will me gently beatrice sonnet xxv how long shall this like dying life endure and know no end of her own misery but wast and wear away in terms unsure betwixt fear and hope depending doubtfully yet better were atonce to let me die and show the last ensample of your pride then to torment me thus with cruelty to prove your pour which i too well have tried but yet if in your hardened breast you hide a close intent at last to show me grace then all the woes and wrecks which i abide as means of bliss i gladly will embrace and wish that more and greater they might be that greater meed at last may turn to me sonnet xxvi sweet is the rose but grows upon a brere sweet is the iunipere but sharp his bough sweet is the eglantine but pricks never sweet is the firbloome but his branches rough sweet is the cypress but his rind is tough sweet is the nut but bitter is his pill sweet is the broom-flower but yet sour enough and sweet is moly but his root is ill so every sweet with sour is tempered still that makes it be coveted the more for easy things that may be god at will most sorts of men do set but little store why then should i account of little pain that endless pleasure shall unto me gain sonnet xxvii fair proud now tell me why should fair be proud sith all world's glory is but dross unclean and in the shade of death it self shall shroud how ever now thereof you little ween that goodly idol now so gay beseene shall doff her fleshes borowd fair attire and be forgotten as it had never been that many now much worship and admire ne any then shall after it inquire e any mention shall thereof remain but what this verse that never shall expire shall to you purchase with her thankless pain fair be no longer proud of that shall perish but that which shall you make immortal cherish sonnet xxviii the laurel leaf which you this day do wear guies me great hope of your relenting mind for since it is the badge which i do bear you bearing it do seem to me inclined the pour thereof which ote in me i find let it likewise your gentle breast inspire with sweet infusion and put you in mind of that proud maid whom now those leaves attire proud daphne scorning phaebus lovely fire on the thessalian shore from him did fly for which the gods in their revengeful ire did her transform into a laurel tree then fly no more fair love from phebus chase but in your breast his leaf and love embrace sonnet xxix see how the stubborn damosel does deprave my simple meaning with disdainful scorn and by the bay which i unto her gave accompts my self her captive quite forlorn the bay quoth she is of the victor's born yielded them by the vanquished as their meeds and they therewith do poets heads adorn to sing the glory of their famous deeds but sith he will the conquest challenge needs let her accept me as her faithful thrall that her great triumph which my skill exceeds i may in trump of fame blaze over all then would i deck her head with glorious bays and fill the world with her victorious praise sonnet xxx my love is like to ice and i to fire how comes it then that this her cold so great is not dissolved through my so hight desire but harder grows the more i her entreat or how comes it that my exceeding heat is not delayed by her heart frozen cold but that i burn much more in boiling sweat and feel my flames augmented maniold wht more miraculous thing may be told that fire which all thing melts should harden ice and ice which is congealed with encelesse cold should kindle fire by wonderful devise such is the pour of love in gentle mind that it can altar all the course of kind sonnet xxxi ah why hath nature to so hard a heart given so goodly gifts of beauty's grace whose pride depraues each other better part and all those precious ornaments deface sith to all other beasts of bloody raze a dreadful countenance she given hath that with their terror all the rest may chase and warn to shun the danger of their wrath but my proud one does work the greater sath through sweet allurement of her lovely hew that she the better may in bloody bath of such poor thralls her cruel hands embrew but did she know how ill these two accord such cruelty she would have soon abhorred sonnet xxxii the painful smith with force of fervent heat the hardest iron soon does mollify that with his heavy sledge he can it beatrice and fashion to what he it list apply yet cannot all these flames in which i fry her heart more harden then iron soft awhit ne all the plaints and prayers with which i do beatrice on th'anduyle of her stubborn wit but still the more she fervent sees my fit the more she frieseth in her wilful pride and harder grows the harder she is smit with all the plants which to her be applied what then remains but i to ashes burn and she to stones at length all frozen turn sonnet xxxiii great wrong i do i can it not deny to that most sacred empress my dear dreaded not finishing her queen of fairy that mote enlarge her living praises dead but lodwick this of grace to me aread do you not think accomplishment of it sufficient work for one men simple head all were it as the rest but rudely wri how then should i without another wit think ever to endure so tedious toil sins that this one is tossed with troublous it of a proud love that does my spirit spoil cease then till she vouchsafe to grawnt me rest or lend you me another living breast sonnet xxxiiii like as a ship that through the ocean wide by conduct of some star does make her way whenas a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide out of her course does wander far astray so i whose star that wont with her bright ray me to direct with clouds is overcast do wander now in darkness and dismay through hidden peils round about me placed yet hope i well that when this storm is passed my helice the lodestar of my life will shine again and look on me at last with lovely light to clear my cloudy grief till then i wander careful comfortless in secret sorrow and sad pensiveness sonnet xxxv my hungry eyes through greedy coetize still to behold the object of their pain with no contentment can themselves suffice but having pine and having not complain for lacking it they cannot life sustain and having it they gaze on it the more in their amazement like narcissus vain whose eyes him starved so plenty makes me poor yet are mine eyes so filled with the store of that fair sighed that nothing else they brook but loath the things which they did like before and can no more endure on them to look all this world's glory seems vain to me and all their shows but shadows saving she sonnet xxxvi tell me when shall these weary woes have end or shall their ruthless torment never cease but all my daes in pining languor spend without hope of aswagement or release is there no means for me to purchase peace or make agreement with her thrilling eyes but that their cruelty does still increase and daily more augment my miseries but when you have showed all extremities then think how little glory you have gained by slaying him whose life though you despise mote have your life in honour long maintained but by his death which some perhaps will moan you shall condemned be of many a one sonnet xxxvii what guile is this that those her golden tresses she does attire under a net of gold and with sl skill so cunningly them dresses that which is gold or hear may scarce be told is it that men's frail eyes which gaze too bold she may entangle in that golden snare and being caught may craftily enfold their weaker hearts which are not well aware take heed therefore mine eyes how you do tear hence forth too rashly on that guileful net in which if ever you entrapped are out of her bans you by no means shall get fondness it were for any being free to covet fetters though they golden be sonnet xxxviii a rion when through tempests cruel wrack he forth was thrown into the greedy seas through the sweet music which his harp did make allu'rd a dolphin him from death to ease but my rude music which was wont to please some dainty ears cannot with any skill the dreadful tempest of her wrath appease nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will but in her pride she doth persever still all careless how my life for her decayse yet with one word she can it save or spill to spill were pity but to save were praise chosen rather to be praised for doing good then to be blamed for spilling guiltless blood sonnet xxxix sweet smile the daughter of the queen of love expressing all thy mother's powerful art with which she wonts to temper angry ioue when all the gods he threats with thundering dart sweet is thy virtue as thy self sweet art for when on me thou shinedst late in sadness a melting pleasance ran through every part and me revived with heart robbing gladness whilst rapt with joy resembling heavenly madness my soul was ravished quite as in a trance and feeling thence no more her sorrows sadness fed on the fullness of that cheerful glance over sweet than nectar or ambrosial meat seemed every bit which thenceforth i did eat sonnet xl mark when she smiles with amiable cheer and tell me whereto can you liken it when on each eyelid sweetly do appear and hundred graces as in shade to fit likest it seems in my simple wit unto the fair sunshine in some day that when a dreadful storm away is flit through the broad world does spread his goodly ray at sighed whereof each bird that sits on spray and every beast that to his den was fled comes forth afresh out of their late dismay and to the light lift up their drooping head so my storm beaten heart likewise is cheered with that sunshine when cloudy looks are cleared sonnet xli is it her nature or is it her will to be so cruel to and humbled foe if nature then she may it mend with skill if will then she at will may will forgo but if her nature and her will be so that she will plague the man that loves her most and take delight t'encrease a wretches woe then all her nature's goodly guits are lost and that same glorious beauty's idle boast is but a bait such wretches to beguile as being long in her loves tempest ost she means at last to make her piteous spoil o fairest fair let never it be nam that so fair beauty was so foully shamed sonnet xlii the love which me so cruelly torments so pleasing is in my extremest pain that all the more my sorrow it augmenteth the more i love and do embrace my bane ne do i wish or wishing were but vain to be acquit from my continual smart but joy her thrall or ever to remain and yield for pledge my poor captived heart the which that it from her may never start let her if please her bind with adamant chain and rome all wandering loves which mote pervert his safe assurance strongly it restrain only let her abstain from cruelty and do me not before my time to die sonnet xliii shall i then silent be or shall i speak and if i speak her wrath renew i shall and if i silent be my heart will break or choked be with ouefwing gall what tyranny is this both my heart to thrall and eke my tongue with proud restraint to tie that neither i may speak nor think at all but like a stupid stock in silence die yet i my heart with silence secretly will teach to speak and my just cause to plead and eke mine eyes with meek humility love learned letters to her eyes to read which her deep wit that true hearts thought can sell will soon conceive and learn to construe well sonnet xliiii when those renowned noble peers of greece through stubborn pride among themselves did in forgetful of the famous golden fleece then orpheus with his harp their strife did bar but this continual cruel civil war the which my self against my self do make whilst my weak powers of passion warrayed are no skill can stint nor reason can aslake but when in hand my tuneless harp i take then do i more augment my foes despite and grief renew and passion do awake to battle fresh against my self to fight amongst whom the more i seek to settle peace the more i find their malice to increase sonnet xlv leaue lady in your glass of crystal clean your goodly self for evermore to view and in my self my inward self i mean most lively like behold your semblant true within my heart though hardly it can show thing so divine to view of earthly eye the fair idea of your celestial hew and every part remains immortally and were it not that through your cruelty with sorrow dimmed and deformed it were the goodly image of your visnomy clearer then crystal would therein appear but if your self in me the plain will see remove the cause by which your fair beams darkened be sonnet xlvi when my abodes prefixed time is spent my cruel fair straight bids me weened my way but then from heaven most hideous storms are sent as willing me against her will to stay whom then shall i or heaven or her obey the heavens know best what is the best for me but as she will whose will my life does sway my lower heaven so it perforce must be but you high heavens that all this sorrow see sith all your tempests cannot hold me back assuage your storms or else both you and she will both together me too sorely wrack enough it is for one man to sustain the tormes which she alone on me does rain sonnet xlvii trust not the treason of those smiling looks until you have their guyleull trains well tried for they are like but unto golden books that from the foolish sith their baits do hide so she with flattering smiles weak hearts does guide unto her love and tempt to their decay whom being caught she kills with cruel pride and feeds at pleasure on the wretched prey yet even whilst her bloody hands them sly her eyes look lovely and upon them smile that they take pleasure in her cruel play and ding do them selves of pain beguile o mighty charm which makes men love their bane and think they die with pleasure live with pain sonnet xlviii innocent paper whom too cruel hand did make the matter to avenge her ire and ee she could thy cause well understand did sacrifice unto the greedy fire well worthy thou to have found better hire then so bad end for heretics ordained yet heresy nor treason didst conspire but plead thy masters cause unjustly pained whom she all careless of his grief constrained to utter forth anguish of his heart and would not hear when he to her complained the piteous passion oh his dying smart yet live for ever though against her will and speak her good though she requite it ill sonnet xlix fair cruel why are you so fierce and cruel is it because your eyes have pour to kill then know that mercy is the mighty jewel and greater glory think to save then spill but i it be your pleasure and proud will to show the pour of your imperious eyes then not on him that never thought you ill but bend your force against your enemies let them eel utmost of your cruelties and kill with looks as cockatrices do but him that at your footstool humbled lies with merciful regard give mercy too such mercy shall you make admired to be so shall you live by giving life to me sonnet l. long languishing in double malady of my hearts wound and of my bodies grief there came to me a leach that would apply fit medicines for my bodies best relief vain man quod i that hast but little priee in deep discovery of the minds disease is not the heart of all the body chief and rules the members as it self does please then with some cordials seek first to appease the inward languour of my wounded heart and then my body shall have shortly ease but such sweet cordials pass physicians art then my lses leach do you your skill reveal and with one salve both heart and body heal sonnet li do i not see that fairest images of hardest marble are oh purpose made for that they should endure through many ages ne let their famous monuments to ade why then do i vntrainde in lovers trade her hardness blame which i should more commend sith never ought was excellent assayed which was not hard achieve and bring to end ne ought so hard but he that would attend mote soften it and to his will allue so do i hope her stubborn heart to bend and that it then more steadfast will endure only my pains will be the more to get her but having her my joy will be the greater sonnet lii so oft as homeward i from her depart i go like one that having lost the field is prisoner led away with heavy hat despoiled of warlike arms and known shield so do i now my self a prisoner yield to sorrow and to solitary pain from presence oh my dearest deer exylde long while alone in languor to remain there let no thought of joy or pleasure vain dare to approach that may my solace breed but sudden dumps and dreary sad disdain of all world's gladness more my torment feed so i hr absens will my penance make that of her presens i my meed may take sonnet liii the panther knowing that his spotted hide does please all beass but that his looks them ray within a bush his dreadful head does hide to let them gaze why lest he on them may pray right so my cruel fair with me does play for with the goodly semblant of her hw she does allure me to mine own decay and then no mercy will unto me show great shame it is thing so divine in view made for to be the world's most ornament to make the bait her gazers to embrew good shames to be to ill and instrument but mercy does with beauty best agree as in their maker you them best may see sonnet liiii of this world's theatre in which we stay my love like the spectator ydly sits beholding me that all the pageants play disguising diversely my troubled wits sometime i joy when glad occasion sits and mask in mirth like to a comedy soon after when my joy to sorrow flits i wail and make my woes a tragedy yet she beholding me with constant eye delights not in my mirth nor es my smart but when i laugh she mocks and when i cry she laughs and hardens evermore her heart what then ca move her if nor mirth nor moan she is no woman but a senseless stone sonnet lv so oft as i her beauty do behold and therewith do her cruelty compare i marvel of what substance was the mould the which her made atonce so cruel fair not earth for her high thoughts more heavenly are not water for her love does burn like fire not air for she is not so light or rare not fire for she does frieze with aint desire then needs another element inquire whereof she mote be made that is the sky for to the heaven her haughty looks aspire and eke her mind is pure immortal high then sith to heaven you likened are the best be like in mercy as in all the rest sonnet lvi fair you be sure but cruel and unkind as is a tiger that with greediness hunt's after blood

dreams nor dreadul ights make sudden sad affrights ne let house fires nor lightnings helpless harms ne let the ponke no other evil sprights ne let mischiuous witches with their charms ne let hob goblins names whose sense we see not fray us with things that be not let not the shriech oule nor the stork be herd nor the night raven that still deadly else nor damned ghosts called up with mighty spells nor grisly vultures make us once afeard ne let th ` unpleasant quire of fogs still croaking make us to wish their choking let none of these their dreary accents sing ne let the woods them answer nor their echo ring but let still silence true night watches keep that sacred peace may in assurance rain and timely sleep when it is time to sleep may ponre his limbs forth on your pleasant plain the while and hundred little winged loves like diverse feathered doves shall fly and flutter round about your bed and in the secret dark that none reproves their pretty stealths shall work & snares shall spread to filch away sweet snatches of delight concealed through covert night the sons of venus play your sports at will for greedy pleasure careless of your toys thinks more upon her

wrought therefore to us be favourable now and sith of women's labours thou hast charge and generation goodly dost enlarge incline they will t'effect our wishful owe and the chaste womb inform with timely seed that may our comfort breed till which we cease our hopeful hap to sing ne let the woods us answer nor our echo ring and thou great iuno which with awful might the laws of wedlock still dost patronise and the religion of the faith first plighted with sacred rites hast taught to solemnize and eke for comfort oaten called art of women in their smart eternally bind thou this lovely band and all thy blessings unto us impart and thou glad genius in whose gentle hand the bridal bower and genial bed remain without blemish or stain and the sweet pleasures of their loves delight with secret aid dost succour and supply till they bring forth the fruitful progeny send us the timely fruit of this same night and thou fair hebe and thou hymen free grant that it may so be till which we cease your further praise to sing ne any woods shall answer nor your echo ring and you high heavens the temple of the gods in which a thousand torches flaming bright do burn that to us wretched earthly clods in dreadful darkness lend desired light and all you powers which in the same remain more then we men can fain pour out your blessing on us plenteously and happy influence upon us rain

heavenly tabernacles there inherit of blessed saints for to increase the count so let us rest sweet love in hope of this and cease till then our timely joys to sing the woods no more us answer nor our

vast design unfold messiah crowned gods reconciled decree rebelling angels the forbidden tree heaven hell earth chaos all the argument held me a while misdoubting his intent that he would ruin for i saw him strong the sacred truths to fable and old song so sampson groped the temples posts in spite the world overwhelming to revenge his sighed yet as i read soon growing less severe i liked his project the success did fear through that wide field how he his way should find over which lame faith leads understanding blind lest he perplexed the things he would explain and what was easy he should render vain or if a work so infinite he spanned jealous i was that some less skilful hand such as disquiet always what is well and by ill imitating would excel might hence presume the whole creations day to change in scenes and show it in a play pardon me mighty poet nor despise my causeless yet not impious surmise but i am now convinced and none will dare within thy labours to pretend a share thou hast not missed one thought that could be fit and all that was improper dost omit so that no room is here for writers left but to detect their ignorance or theft that majesty which through thy work does reign draws the devout deterring the profane and things divine thou treatst of in such state as them preserves and thee inviolate at once delight and horror on us seize thou singest with so much gravity and ease and above humane flight dost soar aloft with plume so strong so equal and so soft the bird named from that paradise you sing so never flags but always keeps on wing where couldst thou words of such a compass find whence furnish such a vast expense of mind just heaven thee like tiresias to requite rewards with prophesy thy loss of sighed well mightest thou scorn thy readers to allure with tinkling rhime of thy own sense secure while the town-bayes writes all the while and spells ▪ and like a packhorse tires without his bells' their fancies like our bushy-points appear the poets tag them we for fashion wear i too transported by the mode offend and while i meant to praise thee must commend thy verse created like thy theme sublime in number weight and measure needs not rhime ▪ a. m. the verse the measure is english heroic verse without rhyme as that of homer in greek and of virgil in latin rhyme being no necessary adjunct or true ornament of poem or good verse in longer works especially but the invention of a barbarous age to set off wretched matter and lame meeter graced indeed since by the use of some famous modern poets carried away by custom but much to their own vexation hindrance and constraint to express many things otherwise and for the most part worse then else they would have expressed them not without cause therefore some both italian and spanish poets of prime note have rejected rhyme both in longer and shorter works as have also long since our best english tragedies as a thing of it self to all judicious ears triveal and of no true musical delight which consists only in apt numbers fit quantity of syllables and the sense variously drawn out from one verse into another not in the jingling found of like endings a fault avoided by the learned ancients both in poetry and all good oratory this neglect then of rhyme so little is to be taken for a defect though it may seem so perhaps to vulgar readers that it rather is to be esteemed and example set the first in english of ancient liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage of rimeing paradise lost. book i the argument this first book proposes first in brief the whole subject men disobedience and the loss thereupon of paradise wherein he was placed then touches the prime cause of his fallen the serpent or rather satan in the serpent who revolting from god and drawing to his side many legions of angels was by the command of god driven out of heaven with all his crew into the great deep which actium passed over the poem hasts into the midst of things presenting satan with his angels now fallen into hell described here not in the centre for heaven and earth may be supposed as yet not made certainly not yet accursed but in a place of utter darkness fitliest called chaos here satan with his angels lying on the burning lake thunderstruck and astonished after a certain space recovers as from confusion calls up him who next in order and dignity lay by him they confer of their miserable fallen ▪ satan awakens all his legions who lay till then in the same manner confounded they rise their numbers array of battle their chief leaders named according to the idols known afterwards in canaan and the countries adjoining to these satan directs his speech comforts them with hope yet of regaining heaven but tells them lastly of a new world and new kind of creature to be created according to and ancient prophesy or report in heaven for that angels were long before this visible creation was the opinion of many ancient father's to find out the truth of this prophesy and what to determine thereon he refers to a full council what his associates thence attempt pandemonium the place of satan rises suddenly built out of the deep the infernal peers there fit in council of men first disobedience and the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world and all our woe with loss of eden till one greater man restore us and regain the blissful seat sing heavenly muse that on the secret top of oreb or of sinai didst inspire that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed in the beginning how the heavens and earth rose out of chaos or if sion hill delight thee more and siloa's brook that flowed fast by the oracle of god i thence invoke thy aid to my adventurous song that with no middle flight intends to soar above the aonian mount while it pursues things unattempted yet in prose or rhime and chiefly thou oh spirit that dost prefer before all temples the upright heart and pure instruct me for thou knowest thou from the first wast present and with mighty wings outspread dovelike satst brooding on the vast abyss and madest it pregnant what in me is dark illumin what is low raise and support that to the highth of this great-argument i may assert eternal providence and justify the ways of god to men say first for heaven hides nothing from thy view nor the deep tract of hell say first what cause moved our grand parents in that happy state favoured of heaven so highly to fallen off from their creator and transgress his will for one restraint lords of the world beside who first seduced them to that foul revolt the infernal serpent he it was whose guile stirred up with envy and revenge deceived the mother of mankind what time his pride had cast him out from heaven with all his host of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring to set himself in glory above his peers he trusted to have equaled the most high if he opposed and with ambitious aim against the throne and monarchy of god raised impious war in heaven and battle proud with vain attempt him the almighty power hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky with hideous ruin and combustion down to bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire who durst defy the omnipotent to arms. nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men he with his horrid crew lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf confounded though immortal but his doom reserved him to more wrath for now the thought both of lost happiness and lasting pain torments him round he throws his baleful eyes that witnessed huge affliction and dismay mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate at once as far as angels kenn he views the dismal situation waste and wild a dungeon horrible on all sides round as one great furnace flamed yet from those flames no light but rather darkness visible served only to discover sights of woe regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end still urges and a fiery deluge fed with ever-burning sulphur unconsumed such place eternal justice had prepared for those rebellious here their prison ordained in utter darkness and their portion set as far removed from god and light of heaven as from the centre thrice to the utmost pole o how unlike the place from whence they fell there the companions of his fallen overwhelmed with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire he soon discerns and weltering by his side one next himself in power and next in crime long after known in palestine and named beelzebub to whom the arch-enemy and thence in heaven called satan with bold words breaking the horrid silence thus began if thou be'st he but oh how fallen how changed from him who in the happy realms of light clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine myriads though bright if he whom mutual league united thoughts and counsels equal hope and hazard in the glorious enterprise joined with me once now misery hath joined in equal ruin into what pit thou seest from what highth fallen so much the stronger proved he with his thunder and till then who knew the force of those dire arms yet not for those nor what the potent victor in his rage can else inflict do i repent or change though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind and high disdain from sense of injured merit that with the mightiest raised me to contend and to the fierce contention brought along innumerable force of spirits armed that durst dislike his reign and me preferring his utmost power with adverse power opposed in dubious battle on the plains of heaven and shook his throne what though the field be lost all is not lost the unconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield and what is else not to be overcome that glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and deify his power who from the terror of this arm so late doubted his empire that were low indeed that were and ignominy and shame beneath this downfall since by fate the strength of gods and this empyreal substance cannot fallen since through experience of this great event in arms not worse in foresight much advanced we may with more successful hope resolve to wage by force or guile eternal war irreconcileable to our grand foe who now triumphs and in the excess of joy sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven so spoke the apostate angel though in pain vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair and him thus answered soon his bold compear o prince oh chief of many throned powers that led the imbattelld seraphim to war under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds fearless endangered heavens perpetual king and put to proof his high supremacy whither upheld by strength or chance or fate too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and soul defeat hath lost us heaven and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far as gods and heavenly essences can perish for the mind and spirit remains invincible and vigour soon returns though all our glory extinct and happy state here swallowed up in endless misery but what if he our conqueror whom i now of force believe almighty since no less then such could have orepow'rd such force as ours have left us this our spirit and strength entire strongly to suffer and support our pains that we may so suffice his vengeful ire or do him mightier service as his thralls by right of war what ever his business be here in the heart of hell to work in fire or do his errands in the gloomy deep what can it then avail though yet we feel strength undiminished or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment whereto with speedy words the archfiend replied fallen cherube to be weak is miserable doing or suffering but of this be sure to do ought good never will be our task but ever to do ill our sole delight as being the contrary to his high will whom we resist if then his providence out of our evil seek to bring forth good our labour must be to pervert that end and out of good still to find means of evil which oft times may succeed so as perhaps shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb his inmost counsels from their destined aim but see the angry victor hath recalled his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail shot after us in storm overblown hath laid the fiery surge that from the precipice of heaven received us falling and the thunder winged with read lightning and impetuous rage perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep let us not slip the occasion whither scorn or satiate fury yield it from our foe seest thou yond dreary plain forlorn and wild the seat of desolation void of light save what the glimmering of these livid flames casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend from off the tossing of these fiery waves there rest if any rest can harbour there and reassembling our afflicted powers consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy our own loss how repair how overcome this dire calamity what reinforcement we may gain from hope if not what resolution from despair thus satan talking to his nearest mate with head uplift above the wave and eyes that sparkling blazed his other parts beside prove on the flood extended long and large lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge as whom the fables name of monstrous size titanian or earthborn that warred on jove briareos or typhon whom the den by ancient tarsus held or that seabeast leviathan which god of all his works created hugest that swim the ocean stream him haply slumbering on the norway foam the pilot of some small night-foundered skiff deeming some island oft as seamen tell with fixed anchor in his skaly rind moors by his side under the lee while night invests the sea and wished morn delays so stretched out huge in length the archfiend lay chained on the burning lake nor ever thence had ris'n or heaved his head but that the will and high permission of all-ruling heaven left him at large to his own dark designs that with reiterated crimes he might heap on himself damnation while he sought evil to others and enraged might see how all his malice served but to bring forth infinite goodness grace and mercy shown on man by him seduced but on himself triple confusion wrath and vengeance poured forthwith upright he rears from off the pool his mighty stature on each hand the flames drivn backward slope their pointing spires and rolled in billows leave i'th' midst a horrid vale then with expanded wings he steers his flight a loft incumbent on the dusky air that felt unusual weight till on dry land he lights if it were land that ever burned with solid as the lake with liquid fire and such appeared in hue as when the force of subterranean wind transports a hill torn from pelorus or the shattered side of thundering aetna whose combustible and fueled entrails thence conceiving fire sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds and leave a singed bottom all involved with stench and smoke such resting found the sole of unblest feet him followed his next mate both glorying to have scaped the stygian flood as gods and by their own recovered strength not by the sufferance of supernal power is this the region this the soil the climb said then the lost arch-angel this the seat that we must change for heaven this mournful gloom for that celestial light be it so since he who now is sovran can dispose and bid what shall be right farthest from him is best whom reason hath equaled force hath made supreme above his equals farewell happy fields where joy for ever dwells hail horrors hail infernal world and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor one who brings a mind not to be changed by place or time the mind is its own place and in it self can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven what matter where if i be still the same and what i should be all but less then he whom thunder hath made greater here at least we shall be free the almighty hath not built here for his envy will not drive us hence here we may reign secure and in my choice to reign is worth ambition though in hell better to reign in hell then serve in heaven but wherefore let we then our faithful friends the associates and copartners of our loss lie thus astonished on the oblivious pool and call them not to share with us their part in this unhappy mansion or once more with rallied arms to try what may be yet regained in heaven or what more lost in hell so satan spoke and him beelzebub thus answered leader of those armies bright which but the omnipotent none could have foiled if once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge of hope in fears and dangers herd so oft in worst extremes and on the perilous edge of battle when it raged in all assaults their surest signal they will soon resume new courage and revive though now they lie groveling and prostrate on yond lake of fire as we erewhile astounded and amazed no wonder fallen such a pernicious highth he scarce had ceased when the superior fiend was moving towards the shore his ponderous shield ethereal temper massy large and round behind him cast the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb through optic glass the tuscan artist views at evening from the top of fesole or in valdarno to descry new lands rivers or mountains in her spotty globe his spear to equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast of some great admiral were but a wand he walked with to support uneasy steps over the burning marl not like those steps on heavens azure and the torrid climb smote on him soar beside vaulted with fire natheless he so endured till on the beach of that inflamed sea he stood and called his legions angel forms who lay intransed thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks in vallombrosa where the etrurian shades high overarched imbowr or scattered sedge a float when with fierce winds orion armed hath vexed the red-sea coast whose waves orethrew busiris and his memphian chivalry while with perfidious hatred they pursued the sojourners of goshen who beheld from the safe shore their floating carcases and broken chariot wheels so thick bestrown abject and lost lay these covering the flood under amazement of their hideous change he called so loud that all the hollow deep of hell resounded princes potentates warriors the flower of heaven once yours now lost if such astonishment as this can seize eternal spirits or have you chosen this place after the toil of battle to repose your wearied virtue for the ease you find to slumber here as in the vales of heaven or in this abject posture have you sworn to adore the conqueror who now beholds cherube and seraph rolling in the flood with scattered arms and ensigns till anon his swift pursuers from heaven gates discern the advantage and descending tread us down thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts transfix us to the bottom of this gulf awake arise or be for ever fallen they herd and were abashed and up they sprung upon the wing as when men wont to watch on duty sleeping found by whom they dread rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake nor did they not perceive the evil plighted in which they were or the fierce pains not feel yet to their generals voice they soon obeyed innumerable as when the potent rod of amrams son in egypts evil day waved round the coast up called a pitchy cloud of locusts warping on the eastern wind that over the realm of impious pharaoh hung like night and darkened all the land of nile so numberless were those bad angels seen hovering on wing under the cope of hell betwixt upper neither and surrounding fires till as a signal given the uplifted spear of their great sultan waving to direct their course in even balance down they light on the firm brimstone and fill all the plain a multitude like which the populous north poured never from her frozen loins to pass rhene or the danaw when her barbarous sons came like a deluge on the south and spread beneath gibralter to

ashtaroth those male these feminine for spirits when they please can either sex assume or both so soft and uncompounded is their essence pure not tied or manacled with joint or limb nor founded on the brittle strength of bones like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose dilated or condensed bright or obscure can execute their aerie purposes and works of love or enmity fulfil for those the raze of israel oft forsook their living strength and unfrequented left his righteous altar bowing lowly down to bestial gods for which their heads as low bowed down in battle sunk before the spear of despicable foes with these in troop came astoreth whom the phoenicians called astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns to whose bright image nightly by the moon sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs in sion also not unsung where stood her temple on the offensive mountain built by that uxorious king whose heart though large beguiled by fair idolatresses fell to idols foul thammuz came next behind whose annual wound in lebanon allured the syrian damsels to lament his fate in amorous ditties all a summer's day while smooth adonis from his native rock ran purple to the sea supposed with blood of thammuz yearly wounded the love-tale infected zions daughters with like heat whose wanton passion in the sacred porch ezekiel saw when by the vision led his eye surveyed the dark idolatries of alienated judah next came one who mourned in earnest when the captive ark maimed his brutus image head and hands lopped off in his own temple on the grunsel edge where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers dargon his name sea monster upward man and downward fish yet had his temple high reared in azotus dreaded through the coast of palestine in gath and ascalon and accaron and gaza's frontier bounds him followed rimmon whose delightful seat was fair damascus on the fertile banks of abbana and pharphar lucid streams he also against the house of god was bold a leper once he lost and gained a king ahaz his fottish conqueror whom he drew gods altar to disparage and displace for one of syrian mode whereon to burn his odious offerings and adore the gods whom he had vanquished after these appeared a crew who under names of old renown osiris isis orus and their train with monstrous shapes and sorceries abused fanatic egypt and her priests to seek their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms rather then human nor did israel escape the infection when their borrowed gold composed the calf in oreb and the rebel king doubled that since in bethel and in dan likening his maker to the grazed ox jehovah who in one night when he passed from egypt marching equaled with one stroke both her first born and all her bleating gods. belial came last then whom a spirit more lewd fell not

with lust and violence the house of god in courts and palaces he also reigns and in luxurious cities where the noise of riot ascends above their loftiest towers and injury and outrage and when night darkens the streets then wander forth the sons of belial flown with insolence and wine witness the streets of sodom and that night in gibeah when the hospitable door exposed a matron to avoid worse

raised to hight of noblest temper hero's old arming to battle and in stead of rage deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved with dread of death to flight or foul retreat nor warning power to mitigate and suage with solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain from mortal or immortal minds thus they breathing united force with fixed thought moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed their painful steps over the burned soil and now advanced in view they stand a horrid front of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise of warriors old with ordered spear and shield awaiting what command their mighty chief had to impose he through the armed files darts his experienced eye and soon traverse the whole battalion views their order due

as when the sun new ris'n looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind the moon in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shon above them all the arch angel but his face deep scars of thunder had entrenched and care sat on his faded cheek but under brows of dauntless courage and considerate pride waiting revenge cruel his eye but cast signs of remorse and passion to behold the fellows of his crime the followers rather far other once beheld in bliss condemned for ever now to have their lot in pain millions of spirits for his fault amerced of heaven and from eternal splendors flung for his revolt yet faithful how they stood their glory withered as when heavens fire hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines with singed top their stately growth though bore stands on the blasted heath he now prepared to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend from wing to wing

for who can yet believe though after loss that all these puissant legions whose exile hath emptied heaven ▪ shall fail to reascend self-raised and repossess their native seat for me be witness all the host of heaven if counsels different or danger shunned by me have lost our hope's but he who reigns monarch in heaven till then as one secure sat on his throne upheld by old repute consent or custom and his regal state put forth at full but still his strength concealed which tempted our attempt and wrought our fallen henceforth his might we know and know our own so as not either to provoke or dread new war provoked our better part remains to work in close design by fraud or guile what force effected not that he no less at length from us may find who overcomes by force hath overcome but

easily outdone by spirits reprobate and in and hour what in and age they with incessant toil and hands innumerable scarce perform nigh on the plain in many cells prepared that underneath had veins of liquid fire sluice from the lake a second multitude with wondrous art found out the massy over severing each kind and scummed the bullion dross a third as soon had formed within the ground a various mould and from the boiling cells by strange conveyance filled each hollow nook as in and organ from one blast of wind to many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes anon out of the earth a fabric huge rose like and exhalation with the found of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet built like a temple where pilasters round were set and doric pillars overlaid with golden architrave nor did there want cornice or freeze with bossy sculptures graven the roof was fretted gold not babilon nor great alcairo such magnificence equaled in all their glories to inshrine belus or serapis their gods or seat their kings when aegypt with assyria strove in wealth and luxury the ascending pile stood fixed her stately highth and strait the doors opening their brazen folds discover wide within her ample spaces over the smooth and level pavement from the arched roof pendant by subtle magic many a row of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed with naphtha and asphaltus yielded light as from a sky the hasty multitude admiring entered and the work some praise and some the architect his hand was known in heaven by many a towered structure high where sceptered angels held their residence and sat as princes whom the supreme king exalted to such power and gave to rule each in his hierarchy the order bright nor was his name unheard or unadored in ancient greece and in ausonian land men called him mulciber and now he fell from heaven they fabled thrown by angry jove sheer over the crystal battlements from morn to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve a summer's day and with the setting sun dropped from the zenith like a falling star on lemnos the aegaean i'll thus they relate erring for he with this rebellious rout fell long before nor aught availed him now to have built in heaven high towers nor did he escape by all his engines but was headlong sent with his industrious crew to built in hell mean while the winged haralds by command of sovran power with awful ceremony and trumpets found throughout the host proclaim a solemn council forthwith to be held at pandaemonium the high capital of satan and his peers their summons called from every band and squared regiment by place or choice the worthiest they anon with hunderds and with thousands trooping came attended all access was thronged the gates and porches wide but chief the spacious hall though like a covered field where champions bold wont ride in armed and at the sultans chair defied the best of panim chivalry to mortal combat or career with lance thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air brushed with the hiss of russling wings as bees in spring time when the sun with taurus rides pour forth their populous youth about the hive in clusters they among fresh dews and flowers fly to and from or on the smoothed plank the suburb of their straw-built citadel new rubbed with baum expatiate and confer their state affairs so thick the aerie crowd swarmed and were straitened till the signal given behold a wonder they but now who seemed in bigness to surpass earth's giant sons now less then smallest dwarfs in narrow room throng numberless like that pigmean raze beyond the indian mount or faery elves whose midnight revels by a forest side or fountain some belated peasant sees or dreams he sees while overhead the moon sits arbitress and nearer to the earth wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance intent with jocund music charm his ear at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms reduced their shapes immense and were at large though without number still amid the hall of that infernal court but far within and in their own dimensions like themselves the great seraphic lords and cherubin in close recess and secret conclave sat a thousand demy-gods on golden seat's frequent and full after short silence then and summons read the great consult began the end of the first book paradise lost. book ii the argument the consultation begun satan debates whither another battle be to be hazarded for the recovery of heaven some advice it others dissuade a third proposal is preferred mentioned before by satan to search the truth of that prophesy or tradition in heaven concerning another world and another kind of creature equal or not much inferior to themselves about this time to be created their doubt who shall be sent on this difficult search satan their chief undertakes alone the voyage is honoured and applauded the council thus ended the rest betake them several ways and to several employments as their inclinations led them to entertain the time till satan return he passes on his journey to hell gates finds them shut and who sat there to guard them by whom at length they are op'nd and discover to him the great gulf between hell and heaven with what difficulty he passes through directed by chaos the power of that place to the sighed of this new world which he sought high on a throne of royal state which far outshon the wealth of ormus and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold satan exalted sat by merit raised to that bad eminence and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires beyond thus high insatiate to pursue vain war with heaven and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displayed powers and dominions deities of heaven for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigor though oppressed and fallen i give not heaven for lost from this descent celestial virtues rising will appear more glorious and more dread then from no fallen and trust themselves to fear no second fate me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven did first create your leader next free choice with what beside in counsel or in fight hath been achieved of merit yet this loss thus far at least recovered hath much more established in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent the happier state in heaven which follows dignity might draw envy from each inferior but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes for most to stand against the thunderers aim your bulwark and condemns to greatest share of endless pain where there is then no good for which to strive no strife can grow up there from faction for none sure will claim in hell precedence none whose portion is so small of present pain that with ambitious mind will covet more with this advantage then to union and firm faith and firm accord more then can be in heaven we now return to claim our just inheritance of old surer to prosper then prosperity could have assured us and by what best way whither of open war or covert guile we now debate who can advice may speak he ceased and next him moloc sceptered king stood up the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair his trust was with the eternal to be deemed equal in strength and rather then be less cared not to be at all with that care lost went all his fear of god or hell or worse he recked not and these words thereafter spoke my sentence is for open war of wiles more unexpert i boast not them let those contrive who need or when they need not now for while they fit contriving shall the rest millions that stand in arms and longing wait the signal to ascend fit lingering here heavens fugitives and for their dwelling place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay no let us rather choose armed with hell flames and fury all at once over heavens high towers to force resistless way turning our torturer into horrid arms against the torturer when to meet the noise of his almighty engine he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels and his throne it self mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe let such bethink them if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumm not still that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat descent and fallen to us is adverse who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our broken rear insulting and pursued us through the deep with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low the ascent is easy then the event is feared should we again provoke our stronger some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction if there be in hell fear to be worse destroyed what can be worse then to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned in this abhorred deep to utter woe where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger when the scourge inexorably and the torturing hour calls us to penance more destroyed then thus we should be quite abolished and expire what fear we then what doubt we to incense his utmost ire which to the highth enraged will either quite consume us and reduce to nothing this essential happier far then miserable to have eternal being or if our substance be indeed divine and cannot cease to be we are at worst on this side nothing and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heaven and with perpetual inroads to alarm though inaccessible his fatal throne which if not victory is yet revenge he ended frowning and his look denounced desperate revenge and battle dangerous to less then gods. on the other side up rose belial in act more graceful and humane a fairer person lost not heaven he seemed for dignity composed and high exploit but all was false and hollow though his tongue dropped manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful yet he pleased the ear and with persuasive accent thus began i should be much for open vvarr oh peers as not behind in hate if what was urged main reason to persuade immediate vvarr did not dissuade me most and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success when he who most excels in fact of arms in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution as the scope of all his aim after some dire revenge first what revenge the towers of heaven are filled with armed watch that render all access impregnable oft on the bordering deep encamp their legions or with obscure wing scout far and wide into the realm of night scorning surprise or could we break our way by force and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection to confound heavens purest light yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne fit unpolluted and the ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief and purge off the baser fire victorious thus repulsed our final hope is flat despair we must exasperate the almighty victor to spend all his rage and that must end us that must be our cure to be no more sad cure for who would lose though full of pain this intellectual being those thoughts that wander through eternity to perish rather swallowed up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night devoid of sense and motion and who knows let this be good whither our angry foe can give it or will ever how he can is doubtful that he never will is sure vvill he so wise let lose at once his ire belike through impotence or unaware to give his enemies their wish and end them in his anger whom his anger saves to punish endless wherefore cease we then say they who counsel vvarr we are decreed reserved and destined to eternal woe whatever doing what can we suffer more what can we suffer worse is this then worst thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms what when we fled amain pursued and strook with heavens afflicting thunder and besought the deep to shelter us this hell then seemed a refuge from those wounds or when we lay chained on the burning lake that sure was worse what if the breath that kindled those grim fires awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his read right hand to plague us what if all her stores were opened and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors threatening hideous fallen one day upon our heads while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious war caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey of racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk under yond boiling ocean wrapped in chains there to converse with everlasting groans unrespited unpitied unrepreevd ages of hopeless end this would be worse vvarr therefore open or concealed alike my voice dissuades for what can force or guile with him or who deceive his mind whose eye views all things at one view he from heavens highth all these our motions vain sees and derides not more almighty to resist our might then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles shall we then live thus vile the raze of heaven thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here chains and these torments better these then worse by my advice since fate inevitable subdues us and omnipotent decree the victor's will to suffer as to do our strength is equal nor the law unjust that so ordains this was at first resolved if we were wise against so great a foe contending and so doubtful what might fallen i laugh when those who at the spear are bold and venturous if that fail them shrink and fear what yet they know must follow to endure exile or ignominy or bonds or pain the sentence of their conqueror this is now our doom which if we can sustain and bear our supreme foe in time may much remit his anger and perhaps thus far removed not mind us not offending satisfied with what is punished whence these raging fires will slack'n if his breath stir not their flames our purer essence then will overcome their noxious vapour or enured not feel or changed at length and to the place conformd in temper and in nature will receive familiar the fierce heat and void of pain this horror will grow mild this darkness light beside what hope the never-ending flight of future days may bring what chance what change worth waiting since our present lot appears for happy though but ill for ill not worst if we procure not to our selves more woe thus belial words clothed in reasons garb counseled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth not peace and after him thus mammon spoke either to disinthrone the king of heaven we war if war be best or to regain our own right lost him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fate shall yield to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter for what place can be for us within heavens bound unless heavens lord supreme we overpower suppose he should relent and publish grace to all on promise made of new subjection with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble and receive strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne with warbled hymns and to his godhead sing forced halleluiah's while he lordly sits our envied sovran and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers our servile offerings this must be our task in heaven this our delight how wearisome eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate let us not then pursue by force impossible by leave obtained unacceptable though in heaven our state of splendid vassalage but rather seek our own good from our selves and from our own live to our selves though in this vast recess free and to none accountable preferring hard liberty before the easy yoke of servile pomp. our greatness will appear then most conspicuous when great things of small useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse we can create and in what place so ever thrive under evil and work ease out of pain through labour and endurance this deep world of darkness do we dread how oft amid thick clouds and dark does heavens all-ruling sire choose to reside his glory unobscured and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar mustering their rage and heaven resembles hell as he our darkness cannot we his light imitate when we please this desert soil wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold nor want we skill or art from whence to raise magnificence and what can heaven show more our torments also may in length of time become our elements these piercing fires as soft as now severe our temper changed into their temper which must needs remove the sensible of pain all things invite to peaceful counsels and the settled state of order how in safety best we may compose our present evils with regard of what we are and were dismissing quite all thoughts of war you have what i advice he scarce had finished when such murmur filled the assembly as when hollow rocks retain the found of blustering winds which all night long had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull seafaring men orewatcht whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest such applause was herd as mammon ended and his sentence pleased advising peace for such another field they dreaded worse then hell so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them and no less desire to found this neither empire which might rise by policy and long process of time in emulation opposite to heaven which when beelzebub perceived then whom satan except none higher sat with grave aspect he rose and in his rising seemed a pillar of state deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care and princely counsel in his face yet shon majestic though in ruin sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies his look drew audience and attention still as night or summer's noontide air while thus he spoke thrones and imperial powers offspring of heaven ethereal virtues or these titles now must we renounce and changing style be called princes of hell for so the popular vote inclines here to continue and built up here a growing empire doubtless while we dream and know not that the king of heaven hath doomed this place our dungeon not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm to live exempt from heavens high jurisdiction in new league banded against his throne but to remain in strictest bondage though thus far removed under the inevitable curb reserved his captive multitude for he be sure in height or depth still first and last will reign sole king and of his kingdom lose no part by our revolt but over hell extend his empire and with iron sceptre rule us here as with his golden those in heaven what fit we then projecting peace and war vvarr hath determined us and foiled with loss irreparable terms of peace yet none vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given to us enslaved but custody severe and stripes and arbitrary punishment inflicted and what peace can we return but to our power hostility and hate untamed reluctance and revenge though slow yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest and may lest rejoice in doing what we most in suffering feel nor will occasion want nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege or ambush from the deep what if we find some easier enterprise there is a place if ancient and prophetic fame in heaven err not another world the happy seat of some new raze called man about this time to be created like to us though less in power and excellence but favoured more of him who rules above so was his will pronounced among the gods and by and oath that shook heavens whole circumference confirmed thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn what creatures there inhabit of what mould or substance how endued and what their power and where their weakness how attempted best by force or subtlety though heaven be shut and heavens high arbitrator fit secure in his own strength this place may lie exposed the utmost border of his kingdom left to their defence who hold it here perhaps some advantageous act may be achieved by sudden onset either with hell fire to waste his whole creation or possess all as our own and drive as we were driven the puny habitants or if not drive seduce them to our party that their god may prove their foe and with repenting hand abolish his own works this would surpass common revenge and interrupt his joy in our confusion and our joy upraise in his disturbance when his darling sons hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse their frail original and faded bliss faded so soon advice if this be worth attempting or to fit in darkness here hatching vain empires thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel first devised by satan and in part proposed for whence but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice to confound the raze of mankind in one root and earth with hell to mingle and involve done all to spite the great creator but their spite still serves his glory to augment the bold design pleased highly those infernal states and joy sparkled in all their eyes with full assent they vote whereat his speech he thus renews well have you judged well ended long debate synod of gods and like to what you are great things resolved which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up in spite of fate neerer our ancient seat perhaps in view of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance re-enter heaven or else in some mild zone dwell not unvisited of heavens fair light secure and at the brightening orient beam purge off this gloom the soft delicious air to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balm but first whom shall we send in search of this new world whom shall we find sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet the dark unbottomed infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way or spread his aerie flight upborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt ere he arrive the happy i'll what strength what art can then suffice or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round here he had need all circumspection and we now no less choice in our suffrage for on whom we send the weight of all and our last hope relies this said he sat and expectation held his look suspense awaiting who appeared to second or oppose or undertake the perilous attempt but all sat mute pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each in others countenance read his own dismay astonished none among the choice and prime of those heaven-warring champions could be found so hardy as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage till at last satan whom now transcendent glory raised above his fellows with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spoke o progeny of heaven empyreal thrones with reason hath deep silence and demur seized us though undismayed long is the way and hard that opt of hell leads up to light our prison strong this huge convex of fire outrageous to devour immures us round ninefold and gates of burning adamant barred over us prohibit all egress these passed if any pass the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide gaping and with utter loss of being threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf if thence he escape into whatever world or unknown region what remains him less then unknown dangers and as hard escape but i should ill become this throne oh peers and this imperial sovereignty adorned with splendour armed with power if aught proposed and judged of public moment in the shape of difficulty or danger could deter me from attempting wherefore do i assume these royalties and not refuse to reign refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour due alike to him who reigns and so much to him due of hazard more as he above the rest high honoured sits go therefore mighty powers terror of heaven though fallen intend at home while here shall be our home what best may ease the present misery and render hell more tolerable if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive or slack the pain of this ill mansion intermit not watch against a wakeful foe while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all this enterprise none shall partake with me thus saying rose the monarch and prevented all reply prudent lest from his resolution raised others among the chief might offer now certain to be refused what erst they feared and so refused might in opinion stand his rivals winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn but they dreaded not more the adventure then his voice forbidding and at once with him they rose their rising all at once was as the found of thunder herd remote towards him they bend with awful reverence prove and as a god extol him equal to the highest in heaven nor failed they to express how much they praised that for the general safety he despised his own for neither do the spirits damned lose all her virtue least bad men should boast their specious deeds on earth which glory excites or clos ambition varnished over with zeal thus they their doubtful consultations dark ended rejoicing in their matchless chief as when

voyage for no narrow frith he had to cross nor was his ear less pealed with noises loud and ruinous to compare great things with small then when bellona storms with all her battering engines bent to raze some capital city or less then if this frame of heaven were falling and these elements in mutiny had from her axle torn the steadfast earth at last his sail-broad vannes he spreads for flight and

through the shock of fighting elements on all sides round environed wins his way harder beset and more endangered then when argo passed through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks or when ʋlysses on

guard by special grace but now at last the sacred influence of light appears and from the walls of heaven shoots far into the bosom of dim night a glimmering dawn here nature first begins her farthest verge and chaos to retire as from her outmost works a broked foe with tumult less and with less hostile din that satan with less toil and now with ease wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light and like a weatherbeaten vessel holds gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn or in the emptier waste resembling air weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold far off the empyreal heaven

argument god sitting on his throne sees satan flying towards this world then newly created shows him to the son who sat at his right hand foretells the success of satan in perverting mankind clears his own justice and wisdom from all imputation having created man free and able enough to have withstood his tempter yet declares his purpose of grace towards him in regard he fell not of his own malice as did satan but by him seduced the son of god renders praises to his father for the manifestation of his gracious purpose towards man but god again declares that grace cannot be extended towards man without the satisfaction of divine justice man hath offended the majesty of god by aspiring to godhead and therefore with all his progeny devoted to death must die unless some one can be found sufficient to answer for his offence and undergo his punishment the son of god freely offers himself a ransom for man the father accepts hint ordains his incarnation pronounces his exaltation above all names in heaven and earth commands all the angels to adore him they obey and hymning to their harps in full choir celebrate the father and the son. mean while satan alights upon the bore

the multitude of angels with a shout loud as from numbers without number sweet as from blessed voices uttering joy heaven rung with jubilee and loud hosanna's filled the eternal regions lowly reverend towards either throne they bow and to the ground with solemn adoration down they cast their crowns inwove with amarant and gold immortal amarant a flour which once in paradise fast by the tree of life began to bloom but soon for men offence to heaven removed where first it grew there grows and flours aloft shading the fount of life and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven rowls over elisian flours her amber stream with these that never fade the spirits elect bind their resplendent locks enwreathed with beams now in lose garlands thick thrown off the bright pavement that like a sea of jasper shon empurpled with celestial roses smiled then crowned again their golden harps they took harps ever tuned that glittering by their side like quivers hung and with preamble sweet of charming symphony they introduce their sacred song and waken raptures high no voice exempt no voice but well could join melodious part such concord is in heaven thee father first they sung omnipotent immutable immortal infinite eternal king thee author of all being fountain of light thy self invisible amid the glorious brightness where thou sittest throned inaccessible but when thou shadest the full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear yet dazzle heaven that brightest seraphim approach not but with both wings veil their eyes thee next they sang of all creation first begotten son divine similitude in whose conspicuous countenance without cloud made visible the almighty father shines whom else no creature can behold on thee impresst the effulgence of his glory abides transfused on thee his ample spirit rests he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein by thee created and by thee threw down the aspiring dominations thou that day thy father's dreadful thunder didst not spare nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels that shook heavens everlasting frame while over the necks thou drovest of warring angels disarraid back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaim thee only extolled son of thy father's might to execute fierce vengeance on his foes not so on man him through their malice fallen father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom so strictly but much more to pity incline no sooner did thy dear and only son perceive thee purposed not to doom frail man so strictly but much more to pity inclined he to appease thy wrauth and end the strife of mercy and justice in thy face discerned regardless of the bliss wherein he sat second to thee offered himself to die for men offence o unexampled love love no where to be found less then divine hail son of god saviour of men thy name shall be the copious matter of my song henceforth and never shall my harp thy praise forget nor from thy father's praise disjoin thus they in heaven above the starry sphere their happy hours in joy and hymning spent mean while upon the firm opacous globe of this round world whose first convex divides the luminous inferior orbs enclosed from chaos and the inroad of darkness old satan alighted walks a globe far off it seemed now seems a boundless continent dark waste and wild under the frown of night starless exposed and ever-threatening storms of chaos blustering round inclement sky save on that side which from the wall of heaven though distant far some small reflection gains of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud here walked the fiend at large in spacious field as when a vulture on imaus bred whose snowy ridge the roving tartar bounds dislodging from a region scarce of prey to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids oh hills where flocks are fed flies towards the springs of ganges or hydaspes indian streams but in his way lights on the barren plains of sericana where chineses drive with sails and wind their cany wagons light so on this windy sea of land the fiend walked up and down alone bent on his prey alone for other creature in this place living or liveless to be found was none none yet but store hereafter from the earth up hither like aereal vapours flew of all things transitory and vain when since with vanity had filled the works of men both all things vain and all who in vain things built their found hope's of glory or lasting fame or happiness in this or the other life all who have their reward on earth the fruits of painful superstition and blind zeal nought seeking but the praise of men here find fit retribution empty as their deeds all the unaccompisht works of nature's hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain till final dissolution wander here not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamt those argent fields more likely habitants translated saints or middle spirits hold betwixt the angelical and human kind hither of ill-joynd sons and daughters born first from the ancient world those giants came with many a vain exploit though then renowned the builders next of babel on the plain of sennaar and still with vain design new babels had they wherewithal would built others came single he who to be deemed a god leaped fondly into aetna flames empedocles and he who to enjoy plito's elysium leaped into the sea cleombrotus and many more too long embryo's and idiots eremites and friars white black and gray with all their trumpery here pilgrim's rome that strayed so far to seek in golgotha him dead who lives in heaven and they who to be sure of paradise dying put on the weeds of dominic or in franciscan think to pass disguised they pass the planets seven and pass the fixed and that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs the trepidation talked and that first moved and now saint peter at heavens wicket seems to wait them with his keys and now at foot of heavens ascent they lift their feet when lo a violent cross wind from either coast blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry into the devious air then might you see cowles hoods and habits with their wearers tossed and flutterd rags then relics beads indulgences dispenses pardons bulls the sport of winds all these upwhirld aloft fly over the backside of the world far off into a limbo large and broad since called the paradise of fools to few unknown long after now unpeopled and uncrod all this dark globe the fiend found as he passed and long he wanderd till at last a gleam of dawning light turned thitherward in haste his traveled steps far distant he descries ascending by degrees magnificent up to the wall of heaven a structure high at top whereof but far more rich appeared the work as of a kingly palace gate with frontispice of diamond and gold imbellisht thick with sparkling orient gems the portal shon inimitable on earth by model or by shading pencil drawn ▪ the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw angels ascending and descending bans of guardians bright when he from esau fled to padan-aram in the field of luz dreaming by night under the open sky and waking cried this is the gate of heaven each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood there always but drawn up to heaven sometimes viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon who after came from earth sailing arrived wafted by angels or flew over the lake rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds the stairs were then let down whither to dare the fiend by easy ascent or aggravate his sad exclusion from the doors of direct against which op'nd from beneath just over the blissful seat of paradise a passage down to the earth a passage wide wider by far then that of aftertimes over mount sion and though that were large over the promised land to god so dear by which to visit oft those happy tribes on high behests his angels to and from passed frequent and his eye with choice regard from paneas the fount of jordans flood to beersaba where the holy land borders on aegypt and the arabian shore so wide the opening seemed where bounds were set to darkness such as bound the ocean wave satan from hence now on the lower stair that scaled by steps of gold to heaven gate looks down with wonder at the sudden view of all this world at once as when a scout through dark and desert ways with peril gone all night at last by break of cheerful dawn obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill which to his eye discovers unaware the goodly prospect of some foreign land first-seen or some renowned metropolis with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned which now the rising sun guilds with his beams such wonder seized though after heaven seen the spirit malign but much more envy seized at sighed of all this world beheld so fair round he surveys and well might where he stood so high above the circling canopy of nights extended shade from eastern point of libra to the fleecy star that bears andromeda far off atlantic seas beyond the horizon then from pole to pole he views in breadth and without longer pause down right into the world's first region throws his flight precipitant and winds with ease through the pure marble air his oblique way among innumerable stars that shon stars distant but nigh hand seemed other world's or other world's they seemed or happy isles like those hesperian gardens famed of old fortunate fields and groves and floury vales thrice happy isles but who dwelled happy there he stayed not to inquire above them all the golden sun in splendour likest heaven allured his eye thither his course he bends through the calm firmament but up or down by centre or eccentric hard to tell or longitude where the great luminary a looff the vulgar constellations thick that from his lordly eye keep distance due dispenses light from far they as they move their starry dance in numbers that compute days months & years towards his all-cheering lamp turn swift their various motions or are turned by his magnetic beam that gently warms the universe and to each inward part with gentle penetration though unseen shoots invisible venue even to the deep so wondrously was set his station bright there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps astronomer in the sun's lucent orb through his glazed optic tube yet never saw the place he found beyond expression bright compared with aught on earth medal or stone not all parts like but all alike informed with radiant light as glowing iron with fire if metal part seemed gold part silver clear if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite ruby or topaz to the twelve that shon in aarons breastplate and a stone beside imagined rather oft then elsewhere seen that stone or like to that which here below philosophers in vain so long have sought in vain though by their powerful art they bind volatile hermes and call up unbound in various shape old proteus from the sea drained through a limbeck to his native form what wonder then if fields and regions here breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run potable gold when with one virtuous touch the arch-chimic sun so far from us remote produces with terrestrial humour mixed here in the dark so many precious things of colour glorious and effect so rare here matter new to gaze the devil met undazzled far and wide his eye commands for sighed no obstacle found here nor shade but all sunshine as when his beams at noon culminate from the aequator as they now shot upward still direct whence no way round shadow from body opaque can fallen and the air no where so clear sharp'nd his visual ray to objects distant far whereby he soon saw within kenn a glorious angel stand the same whom john saw also in the sun his back was turned but not his brightness hid of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar circled his head nor less his locks behind illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings lay waving round on some great charge employed he seemed of fixed in cogitation deep glad was the spirit impure as now in hope to find who might direct his wandering flight to paradise the happy seat of man his journeys end and our beginning woe but first he casts to change his proper shape which else might work him danger or delay and now a stripling cherube he appears not of the prime yet such as in his face youth smiled celestial and to every limb suitable grace diffused so well he feigned under a coronet his flowing hair in curls on either cheek played wings he wore of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold his habit fit for

universal maker we may praise who justly hath drivn out his rebel foes to deepest hell and to repair that loss created this new happy raze of men to serve him better wise are all his ways so spoke the false dissembler unperceived for neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy the only evil that walks invisible except to god alone by his permissive will through heaven and earth and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps at wisdoms gate and to simplicity resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill where no ill seems which now for once beguiled ʋriel ▪ though regent of the sun and held the sharpest sighted spirit of all in heaven who to the fraudulent impostor foul in his uprightness answer thus returned fair angel thy desire which tends to know the works of god thereby to gforifie the great work-maister leads to no excess that reaches blame but rather merits praise the more it seems excess that led thee hither from thy empyreal mansion thus alone to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps contented with report hear only in heaven for wondered indeed are all his works pleasant to know and worthiest to be all had in remembrance always with delight but what created mind can

earth the seat of man that light his day which else as the other hemisphere night would invade but there the neighbouring moon so call that opposite fair star her aid timely interposes and her monthly round still ending still renewing through mid heaven with borrowed light her countenance triform hence fills and empties to enlighten the earth and in her pale dominion checks the night that spot to which i point is paradise adams abided those lofty shades his bower thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires thus said he turned and satan bowing low as to superior spirits is wont in heaven where honour due and reverence none neglects took leave and towards the coast of earth beneath down from the ecliptic sped with hoped success throws his steep flight in many and aerie wheel nor stayed till on niphates top he lights the end of the third book paradise lost. book iv. the argument satan now in prospect of eden ▪ and nigh the place where he must now attempt the bold enterprise which he undertook alone against god and man falls into many doubts with himself and many passion fear envy and despair but at length confirms himself in evil journeys on to paradise whose outward prospect and situation is described overleaps the bounds sits in the shape of a cormorant on the tree of life as highest in the garden to look about him the garden described satans first sighed of adam and eve his wonder at their excellent from and happy state but with resolution to work their fallen overhears their discourse thence gathers that the tree of knowledge was forbidden them to eat of under penalty of death and thereon intends to found his temptation by seducing them to transgress then leaves them a while to know further of their state by some other means mean while uriel descending on a sunbeam warns gabriel who had in charge the gate of paradise that some evil spirit had escaped the deep and passed at noon by his sphere in the shape of a good angel down to paradise discovered after by his furious gestures in the mount gabriel promises to find him ere morning night coming on adam and eve discourse of going to their rest their bower described their evening worship gabriel drawing forth his bans of nightwatch to walk the round of paradise appoints two strong angels to adams bower lest the evil spirit should be there doing some harm to adam or eve sleeping there they find him at the ear of eve tempting her in a dream and bring him though unwilling to gabriel by whom questioned he scornfully answers prepares resistance but hindered by a sign from heaven flies out of paradise o for that warning voice which he who saw the apocalyps herd cry in heaven aloud then when the dragon put to second rout came furious down to be revenged on men woe to the inhabitants on earth that now while time was our first-parents had been warned the coming of their secret foe and scaped haply so scaped his mortal snare for now satan now first inflamed with rage came down the tempter ere the accuser of mankind to wreck on innocent frail man his loss of that first battle and his flight to hell yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold far off and fearless nor with cause to boast begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast and like a devilish engine back recoils upon himself horror and doubt distract his troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir the hell within him for within him hell he brings and round about him nor from hell one step no more then from himself can fly by change of place now conscience wakes despair that slumberd wakes the bitter memory of what he was what is and what must be worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue sometime towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad sometime towards heaven and the full-blazing sun which now sat high in his meridian tower then much revolving thus in sighs began o thou that with surpassing glory crowned lookest from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sighed all the stars hide their diminished heads to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name oh sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell how glorious once above thy sphere till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heaven against heavens matchless king ah wherefore he deserved no such return from me whom he created what i was in that bright eminence and with his good upbraided none nor was his service hard what could be less then to afford him praise the easiest recompense and pay him thanks how due yet all his good proved ill in me and wrought but malice lifted up so high i sdeind subjection and thought one step higher would set me highest and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude so burdensome still paying still to owe forgetful what from him i still received and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not but still pays at once indebted and discharged what burden then o had his powerful destiny ordained me some inferior angel i had stood then happy no unbounded hope had raised ambition yet why not some other power as great might have aspired and me though mean drawn to his part but other powers as great fell not but stand unshaken from within or from without to all temptations armed hadst thou the same free will and power to stand thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse but heavens free love dealt equally to all be then his love accursed since love or hate to me alike it deals eternal woe nay cursed be thou since against his thy will chosen freely what it now so justly rues ▪ me miserable which way shall i fly infinite wrauth and infinite despair which way i fly is hell my self am hell and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatening to devour me opens wide to which the hell i suffer seems a heaven o then at last relent is there no place left for repentance none for pardon left none left but by submission and that word disdain forbids me and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath whom i seduced with other promises and other vaunts then to submit boasting i could subdue the omnipotent ay me they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vain under what torments inwardly i groan while they adore me on the throne of hell with diadem and sceptre high advanced the lower still i fallen only supreme in misery such joy ambition finds but say i could repent and could obtain by act of grace my former state how soon would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay what feigned submission swore ease would recant vows made in pain as violent and void for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep which would but led me to a worse relapse and heavier fallen so should i purchase deer short intermission bought with double smart this knows my punisher therefore as far from granting he as i from begging peace all hope excluded thus behold in stead of us outcast exiled his new delight mankind created and for him this world so farewell hope and with hope farewell fear farewell remorse all good to me is lost evil be thou my good by thee at least divided empire with heavens king i hold by thee and more then half perhaps will reign as man ere long and this new world shall know thus while he spoke each passion dimmed his face thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed him counterset if any eye beheld for heavenly minds from such distempers foul are ever clear whereof he soon aware each perturbation smoothed with outward calm artificer of fraud and was the first that practised falsehood under saintly show deep malice to conceal couched with revenge yet not enough had practised to deceive ʋriel once warned whose eye pursued him down the way he went and on the assyrian mount saw him disfigured more then could befall spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce he marked and mad demeanour then alone as he supposed all unobserved unseen so on he fares and to the border comes of eden where delicious paradise now nearer crowns with her enclosure green as with a rural mound the champain head of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides with thicket overgrown gottesque and wild access denied and over head up grew insuperable highth of loftiest shade cedar and pine and firr and branching palm a sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend shade above shade a woody theatre of stateliest view yet higher then their tops the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung which to our general sire gave prospect large into is nether empire neighbouring round and igher then that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaded with fairest fruit blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue apperd with gay enameled colours mixed on which the sun more glad impressed his beams then n fair evening cloud or humid bow when god hath showrd the earth so lovely seemed that antskip and of pure now purer air meets his approach and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy able to drive all sadness but despair now gentle gales fanning their odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes and whisper whence they stole those balmy spoils as when to them who sail beyond the cape of hope and now are passed mozambic off at sea north-east winds blow sabean odours from the spicy shore of arabie the blessed with such delay well pleased they slack their course and many a league cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles so entertained those odorous sweets the fiend who came their bane though with them better pleased then asmodeus with the fishy fume that drove him though enamoured from the spouse of tobits son and with a vengeance sent from media post to aegypt there fast bound now to the ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journeyed on pensive and slow but further way found none so thick entwined as one continued brake the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed all path of man or beast that passed that way one gate there only was and that looked east on the other side which when the arch-felon saw due entrance he disdained and in contempt at one slight bound high over leaped all bound of hill or highest wall and sheer within lights on his feet as when a prowling wolf whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey watching where shepherd's pen their flocks at eve in hurdled coats amid the field secure leaps over the fence with ease into the fouled or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash of some rich burgher whose substantial doors cross-barred and bolted fast fear no assault in at the window climbs or over the tiles so climbed this first grand thief into gods fouled so since into his church lewd hirelings climb thence up he flew and on the tree of life the middle tree and highest there that grew sat like a cormorant yet not true life thereby regained but sat devising death to them who lived nor on the virtue thought of that life-giving plant but only used for prospect what well used had been the pledge of immortality so little knows any but god alone to valve right the good before him but perverts best things to worst abuse or to their meanest use beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense exposed in narrow room nature's whole wealth yea more a heaven on earth for blissful paradise of god the garden was by him in the east of eden planted eden stretchd her line from auran eastward to the royal towers of great seleucia built by grecian kings or where the sons of eden long before dwelled in telassar in this pleasant soil his far more pleasant garden god ordained out of the fertile ground he caused to grow all trees of noblest kind for sighed smell taste and all amid them stood the tree of life high eminent blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill southward through eden went a river large nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill passed underneath ingulft for god had thrown that mountain as his garden mould high raised upon the rapid current which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill waterd the garden thence united fell down the steep glade and met the nether flood which from his darksome passage now appears and now divided into four main streams runs diverse wandering many a famous realm and country whereof here needs no account but rather to tell how if art could tell how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold with mazy error under pendant shades ran nectar visiting each plant and fed flours worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots but nature boon poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field and where the unpierced shade imbround the noontide bowers thus was this place balm a happy rural seat of various view groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and others whose fruit burnished with golden rind

not that fair field of enna where proserpin gathering flours her self a fairer flower by gloomy dis was gathered which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes and the inspired castalian spring might with this paradise of eden strive nor that nyscian i'll girded with the river triton where old cham whom gentiles ammon call and lybian jove hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame rhea's eye nor where abassin kings their issue guard mount amara though this by some supposed true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus head enclosed with shining rock a whole days journey high but wide remote from this assyrian garden where the fiend saw undelighted all delight all kind of living creatures new to sighed and strange two of far nobler shape erect and tall godlike erect with native honour clad in naked majesty seemed lords of all and worthy seemed for in their looks divine the image of their glorious maker

tendrils which implied subjection but required with gentle sway and by her yielded by him best received yielded with coy submission modest pride and sweet reluctant amorous delay nor those mysterious parts were then concealed then was not guilty shame dishonest shame of nature's works honour dishonourable sin-bred how have you troubled all mankind with shows instead mere shows of seeming pure and banished from men life his happiest life simplicity and spotless innocence so passed they naked on nor shunned the sighed of god or angel for they thought no ill so hand in hand they passed the louliest pair that ever since in loves embraces met adam the goodliest man of men since born his sons the fairest of her daughters eve under a tuft of shade that on a green stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side they sat them down and after no more toil of their sweet gardening labour then sufficed to recommend cool zephyr and made ease more easy wholesome thirst and appetite more grateful to their supper fruits they fell nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs yielded them sidelong as they sat recline on the soft downy bank damasked with flours the favour pulp they chew and in the rind still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems fair couple linked in happy nuptial league alone as they about

ascending scale of heaven the stars that usher evening rose ▪ when satan still in gaze as first he stood scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad o hell what do mine eyes with grief behold into our room of bliss thus high advanced creatures of other mould earthborn perhaps not spirits yet to heavenly spirits bright little inferior whom my thoughts pursue with wonder and could love so lively shines in them divine resemblance and such grace the hand that formed them on their shape hath poured ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh your change approaches when all these delights will vanish and deliver you to woe more woe the more your taste is now of joy happy but for so happy ill secured long to continue and this high seat your heaven ill sensed for heaven to keep out such a foe as now is entered yet no purposed foe to you whom i could pity thus forlorn though i unpitied league with you i seek and mutual amity so straight so close that i with you must dwell or you with me henceforth my dwelling haply may not please like this fair paradise your sense yet such accept your makers work he gave it me which i as freely give hell shall unfold to entertain you two her widest gates and send forth all her kings there will be room not like these narrow limits to receive your numerous of spring if no better place thank him who puts me loath to this revenge on you who wrong me not for him who wronged and should i at your harmless innocence melt as i do yet public reason just honour and empire with revenge enlarged by conquering this new world compels me now to do what else though damned i should abhor so spoke the fiend and with necessity the tyrants plea excused his devilish deeds then from his lofty stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful heard of those fourfooted kinds himself now one now other as their shape served best his end nearer to view his prey and unespied to mark what of their state he more might learn by word or actium marked about them round a lion now he stalks with fiery glare then as a tiger who by chance hath spied in some purlieu two gentle fawns at play strait couches close then rising changes oft his couchant watch as one who chosen his ground whence rushing he might surest seize them both gripped in each paw when adam first of men to first of women eve thus moving speech turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow sole partner and sole part of all these joys bearer thy self then all needs must the power that made us and for us this ample world be infinitely good and of his good as liberal and free as infinite that raised us from the dust and placed us here in all this happiness who at his hand have nothing merited nor can perform aught whereof he hath need he who requires from us no other service then to keep this one this easy charge of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various not to taste that only tree of knowledge planted by the tree of life so near grows death to life what ere death is some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest god hath pronounced it death to taste that tree the only sign of our obedience left among so many signs of power and rule conferred upon us and dominion given over all other creatures that possess earth air and sea. then let us not think hard one easy prohibition who enjoy free leave so large to all things else and choice unlimited of manifold delights but let us ever praise him and extol his bounty following our delightful task to prune these growing plants and tend these flours which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet to whom thus eve replied o thou for whom and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh and without whom am to no end my guide and head what thou hast said is just and right for we to him indeed all praises owe and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy so far the happier lot enjoying thee praeminent by so much odds while thou like consort to thy self canst not where find that day i oft remember when from sleep i first awaked and found my self reposed under a shade of flours much wondering where and what i was whence thither brought and how not distant far from thence a murmuring found of waters issued from a cave and spread into a liquid plain then stood unmoved pure as the expanse of heaven i thither went with unexperienced thought and laid me down on the green bank to look into the clear smooth lake that to me seemed another sky as i bent down to look just opposite a shape within the watery gleam appeared bending to look on me i started back it started back but pleased i soon returned pleased it returned as soon with answering looks of sympathy and love there i had fixed mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire had not a voice thus warned me what thou seest what there thou seest fair creature is thy self with thee it came and goes but follow me and i will bring thee where no shadow stays thy coming and thy soft embraces he whose image thou art him thou shall enjoy inseparably thine to him shalt bear multitudes like thy self and thence be called mother of human raze what could i do but follow strait invisibly thus led till i espied thee fair indeed and tall under a platan yet methought less fair less winning soft less amiably mild then that smooth watery image back i turned thou following crydest aloud return fair eve whom fliest thou whom thou fliest of him thou art his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent out of my side to thee nearest my heart substantial life to have thee by my side henceforth and individual solace dear part of nay soul i seek thee and thee claim my other half with that thy gentle hand seized mine i yielded and from that time see how beauty is excelled by manly grace and wisdom which alone is truly fair so spoke our general mother and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreproved and meek surrender half embracing leaned on our first father half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her lose tresses hid he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smiled with superior love as jupiter on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds that shed may flowers and pressed her matron lip with kisses pure aside the devil turned for envy yet with jealous leer malign eyed them askance and to himself thus plaind sighed hateful sighed tormenting thus these two imparadised in one another's arms the happier eden shall enjoy their fill of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust where neither joy nor love but fierce desire among our other torments not the least still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines yet let me not forget what i have gained from their own mouths all is not theirs it seems one fatal tree there stands of knowledge called forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidden suspicious reasonless why should their lord envy them that can it be since to know can it be death and do they only stand by ignorance is that their happy state the proof of their obedience and their faith o fair foundation laid whereon to built their ruin hence i will excite their minds with more desire to know and to reject envious commands invented with design to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt equal with gods aspiring to be such they taste and die what likelier can ensue but first with narrow search i must walk round this garden and no corner leave unspied a chance but chance may led where i may meet some wandering spirit of heaven by fountain side or in thick shade retired from him to draw what further would be learned live while you may yet happy pair enjoy till i return short pleasures for long woes are to succeed so saying his proud step he scornful turned but with sly circumspection and began through wood through waste over hill over dale his rome mean while in utmost longitude where heaven with earth and ocean meets the setting sun slowly descended and with right aspect against the eastern gate of paradise leveled his eevning rays it was a rock of alabaster piled up to the clouds conspicuous far winding with one ascent accessible from earth one entrance high the rest was craggy cliff that overhung still as it rose impossible to climb betwixt these rocky pillars gabriel sat chief of the angelic guards awaiting night about him exercised heroic games the unarmed youth of heaven but nigh at hand celestial armoury shields helms and spears hung high with diamond flaming and with gold thither came ʋriel gliding through the even on a sun beam swift as a shooting star in autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired impress the air and shows the mariner from what point of his compass to beware impetuous winds he thus began in haste gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given charge and strict watch that to this happy place no evil thing approach or enter in this day at highth of noon came to my sphere a spirit zealous as he seemed to know more of the almighty's works and chiefly man gods latest image i described his way bent all on speed and marked his aerie gate but in the mount that lies from eden north where he first lighted soon discerned his looks alien from heaven with passion foul obscured mine eye pursued him still but under shade lost sighed of him one of the banished crew i fear hath ventured from the deep to raise new troubles him thy care must be to find to whom the winged warrior thus returned ʋriel no wonder if thy perfect sighed amid the suns bright circle where thou first see far and wide in at this gate none pass the vigilance here placed but such as come well known from heaven and since meridian hour no creature thence if spirit of other sort so minded have over leapt these earthy bounds on purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude spiritual substance with corporeal bar but if within the circuit of these walks in whatsoever shape he lurk of whom thou tellest by morrow dawning i shall know so promised he and ʋriel to his charge returned on that bright beam whose point now raised boar him slope

assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancy and with them forge illusions as he list phantasms and dreams or if inspiring venom he might taint the animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breathes from rivers pure thence raise at least distempered discontented thoughts vain hope's vain aims inordinate desires blown up with high conceits engendering pride him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touched lightly for no falsehood can endure touch of celestial temper but returns of force to its own likeness up he starts discovered and surprised as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid fit for the tun some magazin to store against a rumord vvarr the smutty grain with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air so started up in his own shape the fiend back stepped those two fair angels half amazed so sudden to behold the grieflie king yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon which of those rebel spirits adjudged to hell comest thou escaped thy prison and transformed why satst thou like and enemy in wait here watching at the head of these that sleep know you not then said satan filled with scorn know you not me you knew me once no mate for you there sitting where you durst not soar not to know me argues your selves unknown the lowest of your throng or if you know why ask you and superfluous begin your message like to end as much in vain to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn think not revolted spirit thy shape the same or undiminished brightness to be known as when thou stoodst in heaven upright and pure that glory then when thou no more wast good departed from thee and thou resemblest now thy since and place of doom obscure and foul but come for thou besure shalt give account to him who sent us whose charge is to keep this place inviolable and these from harm so spoke the cherube and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beauty added grace invincible abashed the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is and saw virtue in her shape how lovly saw and pined his loss but chiefly to find here observed his lustre visibly impaired yet seemed undaunted if i must contend said he best with the best the sender not the sent or all at once more glory will be won or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold will save us trial what the least can do single against thee wicked and thence weak the fiend replied not overcome with rage but like a proud steed reined went haughty on chaumping his iron curb to strive or fly he held it vain awe from above had quelled his heart not else dismayed now drew they nigh the western point where those half-rounding guards just met and closing stood in squadron joined awaiting next command to whom their chief gabriel from the front thus called aloud o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way and now by glimpse discern ithuriel and zephon through the shade and with them comes a third of regal port but faded splendour won who by his gate and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell not likely to part hence without contest stand firm for in his look defiance lours he scarce had ended when those two approachd and brief related whom they brought where found how busied in what from and posture couched to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spoke why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribed to thy transgressions and disturbed the charge of others who approve not to transgress by thy example but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place employed it seems to violate sleep and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow gabriel thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise and such i held thee but this question asked puts me in doubt lives ther who loves his pain who would not finding way break lose from hell though thither doomed thou wouldst thy self no doubt and boldly venture to whatever plate farthest from pain where thou mightest hope to change torment with ease and soonest recompense dole with delight which in this place i sought to thee no reason who knowest only good but evil haste not tried and wilt object his will who bound us let him surer bar his iron gates if he intends our stay in that dark durance thus much what was asked the rest is true they found me where they say but that implies not violence or harm thus he in scorn the warlike angel moved disdainfully half smiling thus replied o loss of one in heaven to judge of wise since satan fell whom folly overthrew and now returns him from his prison scaped gravely in doubt whither to hold them wise or not who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicensed from his bounds in hell prescribed so wise he judges it to fly from pain however and to escape his punishment so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell which taught thee yet no better that no pain can equal anger infinite provoked but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee came not all hell broke lose is pain to them less pain less to be fled or thou then they less hardy to endure courageous chief the first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged to thy deserted host this cause of flight thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive to which the fiend thus answered frowning stern not that i less endure or shrink from pain insulting angel well thou knowest i stood thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid thy blasting volied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear but still thy words at random as before argue thy inexperience what behooves from hard assays and ill successes passed a faithful leader not to hazard all through ways of danger by himself untried i therefore i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss and spy this new created world whereof in hell fame is not silent here in hope to find better abided and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth or in mid air though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against whose easier business were to serve their lord high up in heaven with songs to hymn his throne and practised distances to cringe not fight to whom the warrior angel soon replied to say and strait unsay pretending first wise to fly pain professing next the spy argues no leader but a liar traced satan and couldst thou faithful add o name oh sacred name of faithfulness profaned faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew army of fiends fit body to fit head was this your discipline and faith engaged your military obedience to dissolve allegiance to the acknowledge power supreme and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem patron of liberty who more then thou once fawned and cringed and servilely adored heavens awful monarch wherefore but in hope to dispossess him and thy self to reign but mark what i arreede thee now avant fly thither whence thou fledst if from this hour within these hallowd limits thou appear back to the infernal pit i drag thee chained and scale thee so as henceforth not to scorn the facil gates of hell too slightly barred so threatened he but satan to no threats gave heed but waxing more in rage replied then when i am thy captive talk of chains proud limitary cherube but ere then far heavier load thy self expect to feel from my prevailing arm though heavens king ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers used to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels in progress through the road of heaven star-paved while thus he spoke the angelic squadron bright turned fiery read sharpening in mooned horns their phalanx and began to hemm him round with ported spears as thick as when a field of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends her bearded grove of ears which way the wind sways them the careful plowman doubting stands lest on the threshing floor his hopeful sheaves prove chaff on the other side satan alarmed collecting all his might dilated stood like teneriff or atlas unremoved his stature reached the sky and on his crest sat horror plumed nor wanted in his grasp what seemed both spear and shield now dreadful deeds might have ensued nor only paradise in this commotion but the starry cope of heaven perhaps or all the elements at least had gone to rack disturbed and torn with violence of this conflict had not soon the eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heaven his golden scales yet seen betwixt astrea and the scorpion sign wherein all things created first he weighed the pendulous round earth with balanced air in counterpoise now ponders all events battles and realms in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight ▪ the latter quick up flew and kicked the beam which gabriel spying thus bespoke the fiend satan i know thy strength and thou knowest mine ▪ neither our own but given what folly then to boast what arms can do since thine not more then heaven permits nor mine though doubled now to trample thee as mire for proof look up and read thy lot in yond celestial sign where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak if thou resist the fiend looked up and knew his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled murmuring and with him fled the shades of night the end of the fourth book paradise lost. book v. the argument morning approached eve relates to adam her troublesome dream he likes it not yet comforts her they come forth to their day labours their morning hymn at the door of their bower god to render man inexcusable sends raphael to admonish him of his obedience of his free estate of his enemy near at hand who he is and why his enemy and whatever else may avail adam to know raphael comes down to paradise his appearance described his coming discerned by adam afar off sitting at the door of his bower he goes out to meet him brings him to his lodge entertains him with the choicest fruits of paradise god together by eve their discourse at table raphael performs his message minds adam of his state and of his enemy relates at adams request who that enemy is and how he came to be so beginning from his first revolt in heaven and the occasion thereof how he drew his legions after him to the parts of the north and there incited them to rebel with him persuading all but only abdiel a seraph who in argument dissuades and opposes him then forsakes him now morn her rosy steps in the eastern climb advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl when adam waked so customed for his sleep was aerie light from pure digestion bred and temperate vapours bland which the only found of leaves and fuming rills aurora's fan lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song of birds on every bough so much the more his wonder was to find unwak'nd eve with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek as through unquiet rest he on his side leaning half-raised with looks of cordial love hung over her enamoured and beheld beauty which whither waking or asleep shot forth peculiar graces then with voice mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes her hand soft touching whispered thus awake my fairest my espoused my latest found heavens last best gift my ever new delight awake the morning shines and the fresh field calls us we loose the prime to mark how spring our tended plants how blows the citron grove what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed how nature paints her colours how the bee sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet such whispering waked her but with startled eye on adam whom embracing thus she spoke o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose my glory my perfection glad i see thy face and morn returned for i this night such night till this i never passed have dreamed if dreamed not as i oft am wont of thee works of day passed or morrows next design but of offence and trouble which ray mind knew never till this irksome night methought close at mine ear one called me forth to walk with gentle voice i thought it thine it said why sleepest thou eve now is the pleasant time the cool the silent save where silence yields to the night-warbling bird that now awake tunes sweetest his love-labored song now reigns full orbed the moon and with more pleasing light shadowy sets off the face of things in vain if none regard heaven wakes with all his eyes whom to behold but thee nature's desire in whose sighed all things joy with ravishment attracted by thy beauty still to gaze i rose as at thy call but found thee not to find thee i directed then my walk and on methought alone i passed through ways that brought me on a sudden to the tree of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed much fairer to my fancy then by day and as i wondering looked ▪ beside it stood one shapd and winged like one of those from heaven by us oft seen his dewy locks distilled ambrosia on that tree he also gazed and oh fair plant said he with fruit surcharged deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet nor god nor man is knowledge so despised or envy or what reserve forbids to taste forbid who will none shall from me withhold longer thy offered good why else set here this said he paused not but with venturous arm he plucked he tasted me damp horror chilled at such bold words vouched with a deed so bold but he thus overjoyed oh fruit divine sweet of thy self but much more sweet thus cropped forbidden here it seems as only fit for god's yet able to make gods of men and why not gods of men since good the more communicated more abundant grows the author not impaired but honoured more here happy creature fair angelic eve partake thou also happy though thou art happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be taste this and be henceforth among the gods thy self a goddess not to earth confined but sometimes in the air as we sometimes ascend to heaven by merit thine and see what life the gods live there and such live thou so saying he drew nigh and to me held even to my mouth of that same fruit held part which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell so quick'nd appetite that i methought could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds with him i flew and underneath beheld the earth outstretched immense a prospect wide and various wondering at my flight and change to this high exaltation suddenly my guide was gone and i me thought sunk down and fell asleep but oh how glad i waked to find this but a dream thus eve her night related and thus adam answered sad best image of my self and dearer half the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep affects me equally nor ran i like this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear yet evil whence in thee can harbour none created pure but know that in the soul are many lesser faculties that serve reason as chief among these fancy next her office holds of all external things which the five watchful senses represent she forms imaginations aerie shapes which reason joining or disjoining frames all what we affirm or what deny and call our knowledge or opinion then retires into her private cell when nature rests oft in her absence mimic fancy wakes to imitare her but misjoyning shapes wild work produces oft and most in dreams ill matching words and deeds long passed or late some such resemblances methinks i find of our last eevnings talk in this thy dream but with addition strange yet be not sad evil into the mind of god or man may come and go so unapproved and leave no spot or blame behind which gives me hope that what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream waking thou never wilt consent to do be not disheart'nd then nor cloud those looks that wont to be more cheerful and serene then when fair morning first smiles on the world and let us to our fresh employments rise among the groves the fountains and the flours that open now their choicest bosomed smells reserved from night and kept for thee in store so cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered but silently a gentle tear let fallen from either eye and wiped them with her hair two other precious drops that ready stood each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse and pious awe that feared to have offended so all was cleared and to the field they haste but first from under shady arborous roof soon as they forth were come to open sighed of dayspring and the sun who scarce up risen with wheels yet hovering over the ocean brim shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray discovering in wide lantskip all the east of paradise and edens happy plains lowly they bowed adoring and began their orisons each morning duly paid in various style for neither various style nor holy rapture wanted they to praise their maker in fit strains pronounced or sung unmeditated such prompt eloquence flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse more tuneable then needed lute or harp to add more sweetness and they thus began these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame thus wondrous fair thy self how wondrous then unspeakable who first above these heavens to us invisible or dimly seen in these thy lowest works yet these declare thy goodness beyond thought and power divine speak ye who best can tell you sons of light angels for ye behold him and with songs and choral symphonies day without night circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven on earth join all you creatures to extol him first him last him midst and without end fairest of stars last in the train of night if better thou belong not to the dawn sure pledge of day that crownst the smiling morn with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere while day arises that sweet hour of prime thou sun of this great world both eye and soul acknowledge him thy greater found his praise in thy eternal course both when thou climbst and when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest moon that now meetest the orient sun now fliest with the fixed stars fixed in their orb that flies and ye five other wandering fires that move in mystic dance not without song resound his praise who out of darkness called up light air and you elements the eldest birth of nature's womb that in quaternion run perpetual circle multiform and mix and nourish all things let your ceaseless change vary to our great maker still new praise the mists and exhalations that now rise from hill or steaming lake dusky or gray till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold in honour to the world's great author rise whither to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers rising or falling still advance his praise his praise you winds that from four quarters blow breathe soft or loud and wave your tops you pines with every plant in sign of worship wave fountains and ye that warble as you flow melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise join voices all you living souls you birds that singing up to heaven gate ascend bear on your wings and in your notes his praise ye that in waters glide and ye that walk the earth and stately tread or lowly creep witness if i be silent morn or even to hell or valley fountain or fresh shade made vocal by my song and taught his praise hail universal lord be bounteous still to give us only good and if the night have gathered aught of evil or concealed disperse it as now light dispels the dark so prayed they innocent and to their thoughts firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm on to their morning's rural work they haste among sweet dews and flours where any row of fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too far their pampered boughs and needed hands to check fruitless embraces or they led the vine to wed her elm she spoused about him twines her marriageable arms and with her brings her dowr the adopted clusters to adorn his barren leaves them thus employed beheld with pity heavens high king and to him called raphael the sociable spirit that deigned to travel with tobias and secured his marriage with the seaventimes-wedded maid raphael said he thou hearest what stir on earth satan from hell scaped through the darksome gulf hath raised in paradise and how disturbed this night the human pair how he designs in them at once to ruin all mankind go therefore half this day as friend with friend converse with adam in what bower or shade thou findest him from the heat of noon retired to respite his day-labour with repast or with repose and such discourse bring on as may advice him of his happy state happiness in his power left free to will left to his own free will his will though free yet mutable whence warn him to beware he swerve not too secure tell him withal his danger and from whom what enemy late falln himself from heaven is plotting now the fallen of others from like state or bliss by violence no for that shall be withstood but by deceit and lies this let him know lest wilfully transgressing he pretend surprisal unadmonished unforewarned so spoke the eternal father and fulfilled all justice nor delayed the winged saint after his charge received but from among thousand celestial ardors where he stood veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light flew through the midst of heaven the angelic quires on each hand parting to his speed gave way through all the empyreal road till at the gate of heaven arrived the gate self-opened wide on golden hinges turning as by work divine the sovereign architect had framed from hence no cloud or to obstruct his sighed starr interposed however small he sees not unconform to other shining globes earth and the garden of god with cedars crowned above all hills as when by night the glass of galileo less assured observes imagined lands and regions in the moon or pilot from amid the cyclades delos or samos first appearing kenns a cloudy spot down thither prove in flight he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky sails between world's and world's with steady wing now on the polar winds then with quick fan winnows the buxom air till within soar of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems a phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird when to enshrine his relics in the sun's bright temple to egyptian theb's he flies at once on the eastern cliff of paradise he lights and to his proper shape returns a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade his lineaments divine the pair that clad each shoulder broad came mantling over his breast with regal ornament the middle pair girded like a starry zone his waste and round skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold and colours dipped in heaven the third his feet shaddowd from either heel with feathered mail skie-tinctured grain like maia's son he stood and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled the circuit wide strait knew him all the bans of angels under watch and to his state and to his message high in honour rise for on some message high they guessd him bound their glittering tents he passed and now is come into the blissful field through groves of myrrh and flowering odours cassia nard and balm a wilderness of sweets for nature here wantond as in her prime and played at will her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet wild above rule or art enormous bliss him through the spicy forest onward come adam discerned as in the door he sat of his cool bower while now the mounted sun shot down direct his served rays to warm earth's inmost womb more warmth then adam needs and eve within due at her hour prepared for dinner savoury fruits of taste to please true appetite and not disrelish thirst of nectarous draughts between from milky stream berry or grape to whom thus adam called haste hither eve and worth thy sighed behold eastward among those trees what glorious shape comes this way moving seems another morn ris'n on midnoon some great behest from heaven to us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe this day to be our guest but go with speed and what thy stores contain bring forth and pour abundance fit to honour and receive our heavenly stranger well we may afford our givers their own gifts and large bestow from large bestowed where nature multiplies her fertile growth and by disburdening grows more fruitful which instructs us not to spare to whom thus eve adam earth's hallowd mould of god inspired small store will serve where store all seasons ripe for use hangs on the stalk save what by frugal storing firmness gains to nourish and superfluous moist consumes but i will haste and from each bough and break each plant and juciest gourd will pluck such choice to entertain our angel guest as he beholding shall confess that here on earth god hath dispensed his bounties as in heaven so saying with dispatchful looks in haste she turns on hospitable thoughts intent what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix tastes not well joined inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change bestirs her then and from each tender stalk whatever earth all-bearing mother yields in india east or west or middle shore in pontus or the punic coast or where alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat rough or smooth rined or bearded husk or shell she gathers tribute large and on the board heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape she crushes inoffensive moust and meathes from many a berry and from sweet kernels preft she tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold wants her fit vessels pure then strews the ground with rose and odours from the shrub unfumed mean while our primitive great sire to meet his godlike guest walks forth without more train accompanied then with his own complete perfections in himself was all his state more solemn then the tedious pomp that waits on princes when their rich retinue long of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold dazzles the crowd and sets them all agape neerer his presence adam though not awed yet with submiss approach and reverence meek as to a superior nature bowing low thus said native of heaven for other place none can then heaven such glorious shape contain since by descending from the thrones above those happy places thou hast deigned a while to want and honour these vouchsafe with us two only who yet by sovereign gift possess this spacious ground in yonder shady bower to rest and what the garden choicest bears to fit and taste till this meridian heat be over and the sun more cool decline whom thus the angelic virtue answered mild adam i therefore came nor art thou such created or such place hast here to dwell as may not oft invite though spirits of heaven to visit thee led on then where thy bower overshades for these mid-hours till eevning rise i have at will so to the sylvan lodge they came that like pomona's arbour smiled with flourets decked and fragrant smells but eve undecked save with her self more lovely fair then wood-nymph or the fairest goddess feigned of three that in mount ida naked strove stood to entertain her guest from heaven no veil she needed venue-proof no thought infirm altered her cheek on whom the angel haile bestowed the holy salutation used long after to blessed marie second eve haile mother of mankind whose fruitful womb shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons then with these various fruits the trees of god have heaped this table raised of grassy terf their table was and mossile seats had round and on her ample square from side to side all autumn piled though spring and autumn here danced hand in hand a while discourse they hold no fear lest dinner cool when thus began our author heavenly stranger please to taste these bounties which our nourisher from whom all perfect good unmeasured out descends to us for food and for delight hath caused the earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps to spiritual nature's only this i know that one celestial father gives to all to whom the angel therefore what he gives whose praise be ever sung to man in part spiritual may of purest spirits be found no ingrateful food and food alike those pure intelligential substances require as does your rational and both contain within them every lower faculty of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste tasting concoct digest assimilate and corporeal to incorporeal turn for know whatever was created needs to be sustained and fed of elements the grosser feeds the purer earth the sea earth and the sea feed air the air those fires ethereal and as lowest first the moon whence in her visage round those spots unpurged vapours not yet into her substance turned nor does the moon no nourishment exhale from her moist continent to higher orbs the sun that light imparts to all receives from all his alimental recompense in humid exhalations and at even sups with the ocean though in heaven the trees of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn we brush mellifluous dews and find the ground covered with pearly grain yet god hath here varied his bounty so with new delights as may compare with heaven and to taste think not i shall be nice so down they sat and to their viands fell nor seemingly the angel nor in missed the common gloss of theologians but with keen dispatch of real hunger and concoctive heat to transubstantiate what redounds transpires through spirits with ease nor wonder if by fire of sooty coal the empiric alchimist can turn or holds it possible to turn metals of drossiest over to perfect gold as from the mine mean while at table eve ministerd naked and their flowing cups with pleasant liquours crowned oh innocence deserving paradise if ever then then had the sons of god excuse to have been enamoured at that sighed but in those hearts love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy was understood the injured lovers hell thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed not burd'nd nature sudden mind arose in adam not to let the occasion pass given him by this great conference to know of things above his world and of their being who dwell in heaven whose excellence he saw transcend his own so far whose radiant forms divine effulgence whose high power so far exceeded human and his wary speech thus to the empyreal minister he framed inhabitant with god now know i well thy favour in this honour done to man under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed to enter and these earthly fruits to taste food not of angels yet accepted so as that more willingly thou couldst not seem at heavens high feasts to have fed yet what compare to whom the winged hierarch replied o adam one almighty is from whom all things proceed and up to him return if not depraved from good created all such to perfection one first matter all endued with various forms various degrees of substance and in things that live of life but more refined more spiritous and pure as nearer to him placed or nearer tending each in their several active spheres assigned till body up to spirit work in bounds proportioned to each kind so from the root springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves more aerie last the bright consummate flower spirits odorous breathes flours and their fruit men nourishment by gradual scale sublimed to vital spirits aspire to animal to intellectual give both life and sense fancy and undemanding whence the soul reason receives and reason is her being discursive or intuitive discourse is oftest yours the latter most is ours differing but in degree of kind the same wonder not then what god for you saw good if i refuse not but convert as you to proper substance time may come when men with angels may participate and find no inconvenient diet nor too light fare and from these corporal nutriments perhaps your bodies may at last turn all to spirit improved by tract of time and winged ascend ethereal as we or may at choice here or in heavenly paradises dwell if you be found obedient and retain unalterably firm his love entire whose progeny you are mean while enjoy your fill what happiness this happy state can comprehend incapable of more to whom the patriarch of mankind replied oh favourable spirit propitious guest well hast thou taught the way that might direct our knowledge and the scale of nature set from centre to circumference whereon in contemplation of created things by steps we may ascend to god but say what meant that caution joined if you be found obedient can we want obedience then to him or possibly his love desert who formed us from the dust and placed us here full to the utmost measure of what bliss human desires can seek or apprehend to whom the angel son of heaven and earth attend that thou art happy owe to god that thou continuest such owe to thy self that is to thy obedience therein stand this was that caution given thee be advised god made thee perfect not immutable and good he made thee but to persevere he left it in thy power ordained thy will by nature free not overruled by fate inextricable or strict necessity our voluntary service he requires not our necessitated such with him finds no acceptance nor can find for how can hearts not free be tried whither they serve willing or no who will but what they must by destiny and can no other choose my self and all the angelic host that stand in sighed of god enthroned our happy state hold as you yours while our obedience holds on other surety none freely we serve because we freely love as in our will to love or not in this we stand or fallen and some are fallen to disobedience fallen and so from heaven to deepest hell oh fallen from what high state of bliss into what woe to whom our great progenitor thy words attentive and with more delighted ear divine instructer i have herd then when cherubic songs by night from neighbouring hills aereal music send nor knew i not to be both will and deed created free yet that we never shall forget to love our maker and obey him whose command single is yet so just my constant thoughts assured me and still assure though what thou tellest hath passed in heaven some doubt within me move but more desire to hear if thou consent the full relation which must needs be strange worthy of sacred silence to be herd and we have yet large day for scarce the sun hath finished half his journey and scarce begins his other half in the great zone of heaven thus adam made request and raphael after short pause assenting thus began high matter thou injoinst me oh prime of men sad task and hard for how shall i relate to human sense the invisible exploits of warring spirits how without remorse the ruin of so many glorious once and perfect while they stood how last unfold the secrets of another world perhaps not lawful to reveal yet for thy good this is dispensed and what surmounts the reach of human sense i shall delineate so by likening spiritual to corporal forms as may express them best though what if earth be but the shadow of heaven and things therein each to other like more then on earth is thought as yet this world was not and chaos wild reignd where these heavens now roll where earth now rests upon her centre poised when on a day for time though in eternity applied to motion measures all things durable by present past and future on such day as heavens great year brings forth the empyreal host of angels by imperial summons called innumerable before the almighty's throne forthwith from all the ends of heaven appeared under their hierarchs in order bright ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced standards and gonfalons betwixt van and rear stream in the air and for distinction serve of hierarchies of order and degrees or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed holy memorials acts of zeal and love recorded eminent thus when in orbs of circuit inexpressible they stood orb within orb the father infinite by whom in bliss embosomed sat the son amid as from a flaming mount whose top brightness had made invisible thus spoke hear all you angels progeny of light thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand this day i have begotten whom i declare my only son and on this holy hill him have anointed whom you now behold at my right hand your head i him appoint and by my self have sworn to him shall bow all knees in heaven and shall confess him lord under his great vicegerent reign abide united as one individual soul for ever happy him who disobeys me disobeys breaks union and that day cast out from god and blessed vision falls into utter darkness deep ingulft his place ordained without redemption without end so spoke the omnipotent and with his words all seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all that day as other solemn days they spent in song and dance about the sacred hill mystical dance which yonder starry sphere of planets and of fixed in all her wheels resembles nearest mazes intricate eccentric intervolved yet regular then most when most irregular they seem and in their motions harmonic divine so smooths her charming tones that gods own ear listens delighted eevning now approached for we have also our eevning and our morn we ours for change delectable not need forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn desirous all in circles as they stood tables are set and on a sudden piled with angels food and rubied nectar flows in pearl in diamond and massy gold fruit of delicious vines the growth of heaven on flours reposed and with fresh flourets crowned they eat they drink and in communion sweet quaff immortality and joy secure of surfeit where full measure only bounds excess before the all bounteous king who showrd with copious hand rejoicing in their joy now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled from that high mount of god whence light & shade spring both the face of brightest heaven had changed to grateful twilight for night comes not there in darker veil and roseate dews disposed all but the unsleeping eyes of god to rest wide over all the plain and wider far then all this globous earth in plain out spread such are the courts of god the angelic throng dispersed in bans and files their camp extend by living streams among the trees of life pavilions numberless and sudden reared celestial tabernacles where they slept fanned with cool winds save those who in their course melodious hymns about the sovran throne alternate all night long but not so waked satan so call him now his former name is herd no more in heaven he of the first if not the first arch-angel great in power in favour and preeminence yet fraught with envy against the son of god that day honoured by his great father and proclaimed messiah king anointed could not bear through pride that sighed & thought himself impaird deep malice thence conceiving and disdain soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved with all his legions to dislodge and leave unworshipped unobeyed the throne supreme contemptuous and his next subordinate awakening thus to him in secret spoke sleepest thou companion dear what sleep can close thy eye lids and remembrest what decree of yesterday so late hath

from him who reigns new minds may raise in us who serve new counsels to debate what doubtful may ensue more in this place to utter is not safe assemble thou of all those myriads which we led the chief tell them that by command ere yet dim night her shadowy cloud withdraws i am to haste and all who under me their banners wave homeward with flying march where we possess the quarters of the north there to prepare fit entertainment to receive our king the great messiah and his new commands who speedily through all the hierarchies intends to pass triumphant and give laws so spoke the false arch-angel and infused bad influence into the unwary breast of his associate he together calls or several one by one the regent powers under him regent tells as he was taught that the most high commanding now ere night now ere dim night had disincumberd heaven the great hierarchal standard was to move tells the suggested cause and casts between ambiguous words and jealousies to found or taint integrity but all obeyed the wonted signal and superior voice of their great potentate for great indeed his name and high was his degree in heaven his countenance as the morning starr that guides the starry flock allured them and with lies drew after him the third part of heavens host mean while the eternal eye whose sighed discerns abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount and from within the golden lamps that burn nightly before him saw without their light rebellion rising saw in whom how spread among the sons of morn what multitudes were banded to oppose his high decree and smiling to his only son thus said son thou in whom my glory i behold in full resplendence heir of all my might nearly it now concerns us to be sure of our omnipotence and with what arms we mean to hold what anciently we claim of deity or empire such a foe is rising who intends to erect his throne equal to ours throughout the spacious north nor so content hath in his thought to try in battle what our power is or our right let us advice and to this hazard draw with speed what force is left and all employ in our defence lest unawares we loose this our high place our sanctuary our hill. to whom the son with calm aspect and clear lightning divine ineffable serene made answer mighty father thou thy foes justly hast in derision and secure laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain matter to me of glory whom their hate illustrates when they see all regal power given me to quell their pride and in event know whither i be dextrous to subdue thy rebels or be found the worst in heaven so spoke the son but satan with his powers far was advanced on winged speed and host innumerable as the stars of night or stars of morning dew-drops which the sun impearls on every leaf and every flouer regions they passed the mighty regencies of seraphim and potentates and thrones in their triple degrees regions to which all thy dominion adam is no more then what this garden is to all the earth and all the sea from one entire globose stretched into longitude which having passed at length into the limits of the north they came and satan to his royal seat high on a hill far blazing as a mount raised on a mount with pyramids and towers from diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold ▪ the palace of great lucifer so call that structure in the dialect of men interpreted which not long after he affecting all equality with god in imitation of that mount whereon messiah was declared in sighed of heaven the mountain of the congregation called for thither he assembled all his train pretending so commanded to consult about the great reception of their king thither to come and with calumnious art of counterfeited truth thus held their ears thrones dominations princedoms venues powers if these magnific titles yet remain not merely titular since by decree another now hath to himself ingrossed all power and us eclipsed under the name of king anointed for whom all this haste of midnight march and hurried meeting here this only to consult how we may best with what may be devised of honours new receive him coming to receive from us knee-tribute yet unpaid prostration vile too much to one but double how endured to one and to his image now proclaimed but what if better counsels might erect our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke will you submit your necks and choose to bend the supple knee you will not if i trust to know you right or if you know your selves natives and sons of heaven possessed before by none and if not equal all yet free equally free for order and degrees jarr not with liberty but well consist who can in reason then or right assume monarchy over such as live by right his equals if in power and splendour less in freedom equal or can introduce law and edict on us who without law err not much less for this to be our lord and look for adoration to the abuse of those imperial titles which assert our being ordained to govern not to serve thus far his bold discourse without control had audience when among the seraphim abdiel then whom none with more zeal adored the deity and divine commands obeyed stood up and in a flame of zeal severe the current of his fury thus opposed o argument blasphemous false and proud words which no ear ever to hear in heaven expected lest of all from thee ingrate in place thy self so high above thy peers canst thou with impious obloquy condemn the just decree of god pronounced and sworn that to his only son by right endued with regal sceptre every soul in heaven shall bend the knee and in that honour due confess him rightful king unjust thou sayest flatly unjust to bind with laws the free and equal over equals to let reign one over all with unsucceeded power shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute with him the points of liberty who made thee what thou art and formed the powers of heaven such as he pleased and circumscribed their being yet by experience taught we know how good and of our good and of our dignity how provident he is how far from thought to make us less bent rather to exalt our happy state under one head more near united but to grant it thee unjust that equal over equals monarch reign thy self though great and glorious dost thou count or all angelic nature joined in one equal to him begotten son by whom as by his word the mighty father made all things even thee and all the spirits of heaven by him created in their bright degrees crowned them with glory and to their glory named thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers essential powers nor by his reign obscured but more illustrious made since he the head one of our number thus reduced becomes his laws our laws all honour to him done returns our own cease then this impious rage and tempt not these but hast'n to appease the incensed father and the incensed son while pardon may be found in time besought so spoke the fervent angel but his zeal none seconded as out of season judged or singular and rash whereat rejoiced the apostat and more haughty thus replied that we were formed then sayest thou and the work of secondary hands by task transferred from father to his son strange point and new doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw when this creation was rememberst thou thy making while the maker gave thee being we know no time when we were not as now know none before us self-begot self-raised by our own quickening power when fatal course had circled his full orb the birth mature of this our native heaven ethereal sons our puissance is our own our own right hand shall

tidings carry to the anointed king and fly ere evil intercept thy flight he said and as the found of waters deep hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause through the infinite host nor less for that the flaming seraph fearless though alone encompassed round with foes thus answered bold o alienate from god oh spirit accursed forsaken of all good i see thy fallen determined and thy hapless crew involved in this perfidious fraud contagion spread both of thy crime and punishment henceforth no more be troubled how to quit the yoke of gods messiah those indulgent laws will not be now vouchsafed other decrees against thee are gone forth without recall that golden sceptre which thou didst reject is now and iron rod to bruise and break thy disobedience well thou didst advice yet not for thy advice or threats i fly these wicked tents devoted lest the wrauth impendent raging into sudden flame distinguish not for soon expect to feel his thunder on thy head devouring fire then who created thee lamenting learn when who can uncreate thee thou shalt know so spoke the seraph abdiel faithful found among the faithless faithful only he among innumerable false unmoved unshaken unseduced unterrified his loyalty he kept his love his zeal nor number nor example with him wrought to swerve from truth or change his constant mind though single from amid them forth he passed long way through hostile scorn which he sustained superior nor of violence feared aught and with retorted scorn his back he turned on those proud towers to swift destruction doomed the end of the fifth book paradise lost. book vi the argument raphael continues to relate how michael and gabriel were sent forth to battle against satan and his angels the first fight described satan and his powers retire under night he calls a council invents devilish engines which in the second days fight put michael and his angels to some disorder but they at length pulling up mountains overwhelmed both the force and machines of satan yet the tumult not so ending god on the third day sends messiah his son for whom he had reserved the glory of that victory he in the power of his father coming to the place and causing all his legions to stand still on either side with his chariot and thunder driving into the midst of his enemies pursues them unable to resist towards the wall of heaven which opening they leap down with horror and confusion into the place of punishment prepared for them in the deep messiah returns with triumph to his father all night the dreadless angel unpursued through heavens wide champain held his way till morn waked by the circling hours with rosy hand unbarred the gates of light there is a cave within the mount of god fast by his throne where light and darkness in perpetual round lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heaven grateful vicissitude like day and night light issues forth and at the other door obsequious darkness enters till her hour to veil the heaven though darkness there might well seem twilight here and now went forth the morn such as in highest heaven arrayed in gold empyreal from before her vanished night shot through with orient beams when all the plain covered with thick embattled squadrons bright chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view war he perceived war in procinct and found already known what he for news had thought to have reported gladly then he mixed among those friendly powers who him received with joy and acclamations loud that one that of so many myriads fallen yet one returned not lost on to the sacred hill they led him high applauded and present before the seat supreme from whence a voice from midst a golden cloud thus mild was herd servant of god well done well hast thou fought the better sighed who single haste maintained against revolted multitudes the cause of truth in word mightier then they in arms and for the testimony of truth hast born universal reproach far worse to bear then violence for this was all thy care to stand approved in sighed of god though world's judged thee perverse the easier conquest now remains thee alded by this host of friends back on thy foes more glorious to return then scorned thou didst depart and to subdue by force who reason for their law refuse right reason for their law and for their king messiah who by right of merit reigns go michael of celestial armies prince and thou in military prowess next gabriel led forth to battle these my sons invincible led forth my armed saints by thousands and by millions ranged for fight equal in number to that godless crew rebellious them with fire and hostile arms fearless assault and to the brow of heaven pursuing drive them out from god and bliss into their place of punishment the gulf of tartarus which ready opens wide his fiery chaos to receive their fallen so spoke the sovran voice and clouds began to darken all the hill and smoke to roll in dusky wreathes reluctant flames the sign of wrauth awaked nor with less dread the loud ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow at which command the powers militant that stood for heaven in mighty quadrate joined of union irresistible moved on in silence their bright legions to the found of instrumental harmony that breathed heroic ardor to adventurous deeds under their godlike leaders in the cause of god and his messiah on they move indissolubly firm nor obvious hill nor streit'ning vale nor wood nor stream divides their perfect ranks for high above the ground their march was and the passive air upbore their nimble tread as when the total kind of birds in orderly array on wing came summoned over eden to receive their names of thee so over many a tract of heaven they marched and many a province wide tenfold the length of this terrene at last far in the horizon to the north appeared from skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched in battailous aspect and nearer view bristled with upright beams innumerable of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields various with boastful argument portraid the banded powers of satan hasting on with furious expedition for they weened that self same day by fight or by surprise to win the mount of god and on his throne to set the envier of his state the proud aspirer but their thoughts proved found and vain in the mid way though strange to us it seemed at first that angel should with angel war and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet so oft in festivals of joy and love unanimous as sons of one great sire hymning the eternal father but the shout of battle now began and rushing found of onset ended soon each milder thought high in the midst exalted as a god the apostat in his sun-bright chariot sat idol of majesty divine enclosed with flaming cherubin and golden shields then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now betwixt host and host but narrow space was left a dreadful interval and front to front presented stood in terrible array of hideous length before the cloudy van on the rough edge of battle ere it joined satan with vast and haughty strides advanced came towering armed in adamant and gold abdiel that sighed endured not where he stood among the mightiest bent on highest deeds and thus his own undaunted heart explores ' o heaven that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain where faith and realty remain not wherefore should not strength and might there fail where virtue fails or weakest prove where boldest though to sighed unconquerable his puissance trusting in the almighty's aid i mean to try whose reason i have tried unsound and false nor is it aught but just that he who in debate of truth hath wone should win in arms in both disputes alike victor though brutish that contest and foul when reason hath to deal with force yet so most reason is that reason overcome so pondering and from his armed peers forth stepping opposite half way he met his daring foe at this prevention more incensed and thus securely him defied proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached the highth of thy aspiring unopposed the throne of god unguarded and his side abandoned at the terror of thy power or potent tongue fool not to think how vain against the omnipotent to rise in arms who out of smallest things could without end have raised incessant armies to defeat thy folly or with solitary hand reaching beyond all limit at one blow unaided could have finished thee and whelmed thy legions under darkness but thou seest all are not of thy train there be who faith prefer and piety to god though then to thee not visible when i alone seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent from all my sect thou seest now learn too late how few sometimes may know when thousands err whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance thus answered ill for thee but in wished hour of my revenge first sought for thou returnest from flight seditious angel to receive thy merited reward the first assay of this right hand provoked since first that tongue inspired with contradiction durst oppose a third part of the gods in synod met their deities ro assert who while they feel vigour divine within them can allow omnipotence to none but well thou comest before thy fellows ambitious to win from me some plume that thy success may show destruction to the rest this pause between unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know at first i thought that liberty and heaven to heavenly souls had been all one but now i see that most through sloth had rather serve ministering spirits trained up in feast and song such haste thou armed the minstrelfie of heaven servility with freedom to contend as both their deeds compared this day shall prove to whom in brief thus abdiel stern replied apostat still thou errest nor end wilt find of erring from the path of truth remote unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name of servitude to serve whom god ordains or nature god and nature bid the same when he who rules is worthiest and excels them whom he governs this is servitude to serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled against his worthier as thine now serve thee thy self not free but to thy self enthralled yet lewdly darest our ministering upbraid reign thou in hell thy kingdom let me serve in heaven god ever blessed and his divine behests obey worthiest to be obeyed yet chains in hell not realms expect mean while from me returned as erst thou saidst from flight this greeting on thy impious crest receive so saying a noble stroke he lifted high which hung not but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan that no sighed nor motion of swift thought less could his shield such ruin intercept ten paces huge he back recoiled the tenth on bent knee his massy spear upstaid as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong had pushed a mountain from his feat half sunk with all his pines amazement seized the rebel thrones but greater rage to see thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout presage of victory and fierce desire of battle whereat michael bid found the arch-angel trumpet through the vast of heaven it sounded and the faithful armies rung hosanna to the highest nor stood at gaze the adverse lęgions nor less hideous joined the horrid shock now storming fury rose and clamour such as herd in heaven till now was never arms on armour clashing brayed horrible discord and the madding wheels of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise of conflict over head the dismal hiss of fiery darts in flaming volies flew and flying vaulted either host with fire so under fiery cope together rushed both battles main with ruinous assault and inextinguishable rage all heaven resounded and had earth been then all earth had to her centre shook what wonder when millions of fierce encountering angels fought on either side the least of whom could wield these elements and arm him with the force of all their regions how much more of power army against army number less to raise dreadful combustion warring and disturb though not destroy their happy native seat had not the eternal king omnipotent from his strong hold of heaven high overruled and limited their might though numberd such as each divided legion might have seemed a numerous host in strength each armed hand a legion led in fight yet leader seemed each warrior single as in chief expert when to advance or stand or turn the sway of battle open when and when to close the ridges of grim war no thought of flight none of retreat no unbecoming deed that argued fear each on himself relied as only in his arm the moment lay of victory deeds of eternal fame were done but infinite for wide was spread that war and various sometimes on firm ground a standing fight then soaring on main wing tormented all the air all air seemed then conflicting fire long time in even scale the battle hung till satan who that day prodigious power had shown and met in arms no equal ranging through the dire attack of fighting seraphim confused at length saw where the sword of michael smote and felled squadrons at once with huge two-handed sway brandished aloft the horrid edge came down wide wasting such destruction to withstand he hasted and opposed the rocky orb of tenfold adamant his ample shield a vast circumference at his approach the great arch-angel from his warlike toil surceased and glad as hoping here to end intestine war in heaven the arch foe subdued or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown and visage all inflamed first thus began author of evil unknown till thy revolt unnamed in heaven now plenteous as thou seest these acts of hateful strife hateful to all though heaviest by just measure on thy self and thy adherents how hast thou disturbed heavens blessed peace ▪ and into nature brought misery uncreated till the crime of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled thy malice into thousands once upright and faithful now proved false but think not here to trouble holy rest heaven casts thee out from all her confines heaven the seat of bliss brooks not the works of violence and warr. hence then and evil go with thee along thy offspring to the place of evil hell thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils ere this avenging sword begin thy doom or some more sudden vengeance winged from god precipitate thee with augmented pain so spoke the prince of angels to whom thus the adversary nor think thou with wind of airy threats to awe whom yet with deeds thou canst not hast thou turned the least of these to flight or if to fallen but that they rise unvanquished easier to transact with me that thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats to chase me hence err not that so shall end the strife which thou callest evil but we style the strife of glory which we mean to win or turn this heaven it self into the hell thou fablest here however to dwell free if not to reign mean while thy utmost force and join him named almighty to thy aid ▪ i fly not but have sought thee far and nigh they ended parley and both add rest for fight unspeakable for who though with the tongue of angels can relate or to what things liken on earth conspicuous that may lift human imagination to such highth of godlike power for likest gods they seemed stood they or moved in stature motion arms fit to decide the empire of great heaven now waved their fiery swords and in the air made horrid circles two broad suns their shields blazed opposite while expedition stood in horror from each hand with speed retired where erst was thickest fight the angelic throng and left large field unsafe within the wind of such commotion such as to set forth great things by small if nature's concord broke among the constellations war were sprung two planets rushing from aspect malign of fiercest opposition in mid sky should combat and their jarring spheres confound together both with next to almighty arm uplifted imminent one stroke they aimed that might determine and not need repeat as not of power at once nor odds appeared in might or swift prevention but the sword of michael from the armory of god was given him tempered so that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge it met the sword of satan with steep force to smite descending and in half cut shear nor stayed but with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared all his right side then satan first knew pain and writhed him to and from convolved so soar the griding sword with discontinuous wound passed through him but the ethereal substance closed not long divisible and from the gash a stream of nectarous humour issuing flowed sanguine such as celestial spirits may bleed and all his armour stained ere while so bright forthwith on all sides to his aid was run by angels many and strong who interposed defence while others boar him on their shields back to his chariot where it stood retired from off the files of war there they him laid gnashing for anguish and despite and shame to find himself not matchless and his pride humbled by such rebuke so far beneath his confidence to equal god in power yet soon he healed for spirits that live throughout ▪ vital in every part not as

to have disobeyed in fight they stood unwearied unobnoxious to be pained by wound though from their place by violence moved now night her course began and over heaven inducing darkness grateful truce imposed and silence on the odious dinn of war under her cloudy covert both retired victor and vanquished on the foughten field michael and his angels prevalent encamping placed in guard their watches

perfect misery the worst of evils and excessive overturns all patience he who therefore can invent with what more forcible we may offend our yet unwounded enemies or arm our selves with like defence

with thy might rid heaven of these rebelled to their prepared ill mansion driven down to chains of darkness and the undying worm that from thy just obedience could revolt whom to obey is happiness entire then shall thy saints unmix and from the impure farr separate circling thy holy mount unfeigned hallelujahs to thee sing hymns of high praise and i among them chief so said he over his sceptre bowing rose from the right hand of glory where he sat and the third sacred morn began to shine dawning through heaven forth rushed with whirlwind found the chariot of paternal deity flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn it self instinct with spirit but convoyed by four cherubic shapes four faces each had wondrous as with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beril and careering fires between over their heads a crystal firmament whereon a saphir throne inlaid with pure amber and colours of the showrie arch. he in celestial panoply all armed of radiant ʋrim work divinely wrought ascended at his right hand victory sat eagle-winged beside him hung his bow and quiver with three-bolted thunder stored and from about him fierce effusion rolled

messiah blazed aloft by angels born his sign in heaven under whose conduct michael soon reduced his army circumfused on either wing under their head embodied all in one before him power divine his way prepared at his command the uprooted hills retired each to his place they herd his voice and went obsequious heaven his wonted face renewed and with fresh flourets hill and valley smiled this saw his hapless foes but stood obdured and to rebellious fight rallied their powers insensate hope conceiving from despair in heavenly spirits could such perverseness dwell but to convince the proud what signs avail or wonders move the obdurate to relent they hard'nd more by what might most reclaim grieving to see his glory at the sighed took envy and aspiring to his highth stood reimbattelled fierce by force or fraud weening to prosper and at length prevail against god and messiah or to fallen in universal ruin last and now to final battle drew disdaining flight or faint retreat when the great son of god to all his host on either hand thus spoke stand still in bright array you saints here stand you angels armed this day from battle rest faithful hath been your warfare and of god accepted

in battle which the stronger proves they all or i alone against them since by strength they measure all of other excellence not emulous nor care who them excels nor other strife with them do i vouchsafe so spoke the son and into terror changed his countenance too severe to be beheld and full of wrauth bent on his enemies at once the four spread out their starry wings with dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs of his fierce chariot rolled as with the found of torrent floods or of a numerous host. he on his impious foes right onward drove gloomy as night under his burning wheels the steadfast empyrean shook throughout all but the throne it self of god full soon among them he arrived in his right hand grasping ten thousand thunders which he sent before him such as in their souls infixed plagues they astonished all resistance lost all courage down their idle weapons dropped over shields and helms and helmed heads he road of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate that wished the mountains now might be again thrown on them as a shelter from his ire nor less on either side tempestuous fell his arrows from the fourfold-visaged foure distinct with eyes and from the living wheels

overthrown he raised and as a herd of goats or timorous flock together thronged drove them before him thunderstruck pursued with terrors and with furies to the bounds and crystal wall of heaven which opening wide rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed into the wasteful deep the monstrous sighed strook them with horror backward but far worse urged them behind headlong themselves they threw down

the end of the sixth book paradise lost. book vii the argument raphael at the request of adam relates how and wherefore this world was first created that god after the expelling of satan and his angels out of heaven declared his pleasure to create another world and other creatures to dwell therein sends his son with glory and attendance of angels to perform the work of creation in six days the angels celebrate with hymns the performance thereof and his reascention into heaven descend from heaven ʋrania by that name if rightly thou art called whose voice divine following above the olympian hill i soar above the flight of pegasean wing the meaning not the name i call for thou nor of the muses nine nor on the top of old olympus dwellest but heavenly born before the hills appeared or fountain flowed thou with eternal wisdom didst converse wisdom thy sister and with her didst play in presence of the almighty father pleased with thy celestial song up led by thee into the heaven of heavens i have presumed and earthly guest and drawn empyreal air thy tempering with like safety guided down return me to my native element lest from this flying steed unreined as once bellerophon

not rapt above the pole more safe i sing with mortal voice unchanged to hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days on evil days though fallen and evil tongues in darkness and with dangers compassed round and solitude yet not alone while thou visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn purples the east still govern thou my song ʋrania and fit audience find though few but drive far off the barbarous dissonance of bacchus and his revellers the raze of that wild rout that tore the thracian barred in rhodope where woods and rocks had ears to rapture till the savage clamor drowned both harp and voice nor could the muse defend her son. so fail not thou who thee implores for thou art heavenly she and empty dream say goddess what ensued when raphael the affable arch-angel had forewarned adam by dire example to beware apostasy by what befell in heaven to those apostates lest the like befall in paradise to adam or his raze charged not to touch the interdicted tree if they transgress and slight that sole command so easily obeyed amid the choice of all tastes else to please their appetite though wandering he with his consorted eve the story herd attentive and was filled with admiration and deep muse to hear of things so high and strange things to their thought so unimaginable as hate in heaven and war so near the peace of god in bliss with such confusion but the evil soon driven back redounded as a flood on those from whom it sprung impossible to mix with blessedness whence adam soon repealed the doubts that in his heart arose and now led on yet sinless with desire to know what nearer might concern him how this world of heaven and earth conspicuous first began when and whereof created for what cause what within eden or without was done before his memory as one whose drouth yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream whose liquid murmur herd new thirst excites proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest great things and full of wonder in our ears far differing from this world thou hast revealed divine interpreter by favour sent down from the empyrean to forewarn us timely of what might else have been our loss unknown which human knowledge could not reach for which to the infinitely good we owe immortal thanks and his admonishment receive with solemn purpose to observe immutably his sovran will the end of what we are but since thou hast vouchsafed gently for our instruction to impart things above earthly thought which yet concerned our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed deign to descend now lower and relate what may no less perhaps avail us known how first began this heaven which we behold distant so high with moving fires adorned innumerable and this which yields or fills all space the ambient air wide interfused embracing round this florid earth what cause moved the creator in his holy rest through all eternity so late to built in chaos and the work begun how soon absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold what we not to explore the secrets ask of his eternal empire but the more ▪ to magnify his works the more we know and the great light of day yet wants to run much of his raze though steep suspens in heaven held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears and longer will delay to hear thee tell his generation and the rising birth of nature from the unapparent deep or if the star of eevning and the moon haste to thy audience night with her will bring silence and sleep listening to thee will watch or we can bid his absence till thy song end and dismiss thee ere the morning shine ▪ thus adam his illustrious guest besought and thus the godlike angel answered mild this also thy request with caution asked obtain thought to recount almighty works what words or tongue of seraph can suffice or heart of man suffice to comprehend yet what thou canst attain which best may serve to glorify the maker and infer thee also happier shall not be withheld thy hearing such commission from above i have received to answer thy desire of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain to ask nor let thine own inventions hope things not revealed which the invisible king only omniscient hath suppressed in night to none communicable in earth or heaven enough is left beside to search and know but knowledge is as food and needs no less her temperance over appetite to know in measure what the mind may well contain oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind know then that after lucifer from heaven so call him brighter once amid the host of angels then that starr the stars among fell with his flaming legions through the deep into his place and the great son returned victorious with his saints the omnipotent eternal father from his throne beheld their multitude and to his son thus spoke at lest our envious foe hath failed who thought all like himself rebellious by whose aid this inaccessible high strength the seat of deity supreme us dispossessed he trusted to have seized and into fraud drew many whom their place knows here no more yet far the greater part have kept i see their station heaven yet populous retains number sufficient to possess her realms though wide and this high temple to frequent with ministeries due and solemn rites but lest his heart exalt him in the harm already done to have dispeopled heaven my damage fondly deemed i can repair that detriment if such it be to loose self-lost and in a moment will create another world out of one man a raze of men innumerable there to dwell not here till by degrees of merit raised they open to themselves at length the way up hither under long obedience tried and earth be changed to heaven & heaven to earth one kingdom joy and union without end mean while inhabit lax you powers of heaven and thou my word begotten son by thee this i perform speak thou and be it done my overshadowing spirit and might with thee i send along ride forth and bid the deep within appointed bounds be heaven and earth boundless the deep because i am who fill infinitude nor vacuous the space though i uncircumscribed ray self retire and put not forth my goodness which is free to act or not necessity and chance approach not me and what i will is fate so spoke the almighty and to what he spoke his word the filial godhead gave effect immediate are the acts of god more swift then time or motion but to human ears cannot without process of speech be told so told as earthly notion can receive great triumph and rejoicing was in heaven when such was herd declared the almighty's will glory they sung to the most high good will to future men and in their dwellings peace glory to him whose just avenging ire had driven out the ungodly from his sighed and the habitations of the just to him glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained good out of evil to

expedition now appeared girded with omnipotence with radiance crowned of majesty divine sapience and love immense and all his father in him shon about his chariot numberless were poured cherub and

exhaling first from darkness they beheld birthday of heaven and earth with joy and shout the hollow universal orb they filled and touched their golden harps and hymning praised god and his works

hollow bottom broad and deep capacious bed of waters thither they hasted with glad precipitance uprowld as drops on dust conglobing from the dry part rise in crystal wall or ridge direct for haste

they found if steep with torrent rapture if through plain soft-ebbing nor withstood them rock or hill but they or under ground or circuit wide with serpent error wandering found their way and on the

receptacle of congregated waters he called seas and saw that it was good and said let the earth put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after her kind whose seed

up and waterd all the ground and each plant of the field which ever it was in the earth god made and every herb before it grew on the green stem god saw that it was good so even and morn recorded the third day again the almighty spoke let there be lights high in the expanse of heaven to divide the day from night and let them be for signs for seasons and for days and circling years and let them be for lights as i ordain their office in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth and it was so and god made two great lights great for their use to man the greater to have rule by day the less by night altern and made the stars and set them in the firmament of heaven to illuminate the earth and rule the day in their vicissitude and rule the night and light from darkness to divide god saw surveying his great work that it was good for of celestial bodies first the sun a mighty sphere he framed unlightsome first though of ethereal mould then formed the moon globose and every

glistering may of solid good contain more plenty then the sun that barren shines whose virtue on it self works no effect but in the fruitful earth there first received his beams unactive else their vigour find yet not to earth are those bright luminaries officious but to thee earth's habitant and for the heavens wide circuit let it speak the makers high magnificence who built so spacious and his line stretched out so far that man may know he dwells not in his own and edifice too large for him to fill lodged in a small partition and the rest ordained for uses to his lord best known the swiftness of those circles attribute though numberless to his omnipotence that to corporeal substances could add speed almost spiritual me thou thinkest not slow who since the morning hour set out from heaven where god resides and eremid-day arrived in eden distance inexpressible by numbers that have name but this i urge admitting motion in the heavens to show invalid that which thee to doubt it moved not that i so affirm though so it seem to thee who hast thy dwelling here on earth god to remove his ways from human sense placed heaven from earth so far that earthly sighed if it presume might err in things too high and no advantage gain what if the sun be centre to the world and other stars by his attractive virtue and their own incited dance about him various rounds their wandering course now high now low then hid progressive retrograde or standing still in six thou seest and what if sev'nth to these the planet earth so steadfast though she seem insensibly three different motions move which else to several spheres thou must ascribe moved contrary with thwart obliquities or save the sun his labour and that swift nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed invisible else above all stars the wheel of day and night which needs not thy belief if earth industrious of her self fetch day traveling east and with her part averse from the suns beam meet night her other part still luminous by his ray what if that light sent from her through the wide transpicuous air to the terrestrial moon be as a star enlightening her by day as she by night this earth reciprocal if land be there fields and inhabitants her spots thou seest as clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce fruits in her soft'nd soil for some to eat allotted there another suns perhaps with their attendant moons thou wilt descry communicating male and female light which two great sexes animate the world stored in each orb perhaps with some that live for such vast room in nature unpossessed by living soul desert and desolate only to shine yet scarce to contribute each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far down to this habitable which returns light back to them is obvious to dispute but whither thus these things or whither not whither the sun predominant in heaven rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun he from the east his flaming road begin or she from west her silent course advance with inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps on her soft axle while she paces even and bears thee soft with the smooth air along solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid leave them to god above him serve and fear of other creatures as him pleases best wherever placed let him dispose joy thou in what he gives to thee this paradise and thy fair eve heaven is for thee too high to know what passes there be lowly wise think only what concerns thee and thy being dream not of other world's what creatures there live in what state condition or degree contented that thus far hath been revealed not of earth only but of highest heaven to whom thus adam cleerd of doubt replied how fully hast thou satisfied me pure intelligence of heaven angel serene and freed from intricacies taught to live the easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts to interrupt the sweet of life from which god hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares and not molest us unless we our selves seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain but apt the mind or fancy is to roave unchecked and of her roving is no end till warned or by experience taught she learn that not to know at large of things remote from use obscure and subtle but to know that which before us lies in daily life is the prime wisdom what is more is fume or emptiness or found impertinence and renders us in things that most concern unpractised unprepared and still to seek therefore from this high pitch let us descend a lower flight and speak of things at hand useful whence haply mention may arise of something not unseasonable to ask by sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned thee i have herd relating what was done ere my remembrance now hear me relate my story which perhaps thou hast not herd and day is yet not spent till then thou seest how suttly to detain thee i devise inviting thee to hear while i relate found were it not in hope of thy reply for while i fit with thee i seem in heaven and sweeter thy discourse is to my ear then fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst and hunger both from labour at the hour of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill though pleasant but thy words with grace divine imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety to whom thus raphael answered heavenly meek nor are thy lips ungraceful sire of men nor tongue ineloquent for god on thee abandantly his gifts hath also poured inward and outward both his image fair speaking or mute all comeliness and grace attends thee and each word each motion forms nor less think we in heaven of thee on earth then of our fellow servant and inquire gladly into the ways of god with man for god we see hath honoured thee and set on man his equal love say therefore on for i that day was absent as befell bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure far on excursion towards the gates of hell squared in full legion such command we had to see that none thence issued forth a spy or enemy while god was in his work lest he incensed at such eruption bold destruction with creation might have mixed not that they durst without his leave attempt but us he sends upon his high behests for state as sovran king and to enure our prompt obedience fast we found fast shut the dismal gates and barricadoed strong but long ere our approaching herd within noise other then the found of dance or song torment and loud lament and surious rage glad we returned up to the coasts of light ere sabbath eev'ning so we had in charge but thy relation now for i attend pleased with thy words no less then thou with mine so spoke the godlike power and thus our sire for man to tell how human life began is hard for who himself beginning knew desire with thee still longer to converse induced me as new waked from soundest sleep soft on the floury herb i found me laid in balmy sweat which with his beams the sun soon dried and on the reaking moisture fed strait towards heaven my wondering eyes i turned and gazed a while the ample sky till raised by quick instinctive motion up i sprung as thitherward endeavouring and upright stood on my feet about me round i saw hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew birds on the branches warbling all things smiled with fragrance and with joy my heart overflowed my self i then perused and limb by limb surveyed and sometime went and sometime ran with supple joints and lively vigour led but who i was or where or from what cause knew not to speak i tried and forthwith spoke my tongue obeyed and readily could name what ever i saw thou sun said i fair light and thou enlight'nd earth so fresh and gay you hills and dales you rivers woods and plains and you that live and move fair creatures tell tell if you saw how came i thus how here not of my self by some great maker then in goodness and in power preeminent tell me how may i know him how adore from whom i have that thus i move and live and feel that i am happier then i know while thus i called and strayed i knew not whither from where i first drew air and first beheld this happy light when answer none returned on a green shady bank profuse of flours pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep first found me and with soft oppression seized my droused sense untroubled though i thought i then was passing to my former state insensible and forthwith to dissolve when suddenly stood at my head a dream whose inward apparition gently moved my fancy to believe i yet had being and lived one came methought of shape divine and said thy mansion wants thee adam rise first man of men innumerable ordained first father called by thee i come thy guide to the garden of bliss thy seat prepared so saying by the hand he took me raised and over fields and waters as in air smooth sliding without step last led me up a woody mountain whose high top was plain a circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees planted with walks and bowers that what i saw of earth before scarce pleasant seemed each tree load'n with fairest fruit that hung to the eye tempting stirred in me sudden appetite to pluck and eat whereat i waked and found before mine eyes all real as the dream had lively shadowd here had new begun my wandering had not he who was my guide up hither from among the trees appeared presence divine rejoicing but with awe in adoration at his feet i fell submiss he reared me and whom thou seekest i am said mildly author of all this thou seest above or round about thee or beneath this paradise i give thee count it thine to till and keep and of the fruit to eat of every tree that in the garden grows eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth but of the tree whose operation brings knowledge of good and ill which i have set the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith amid the garden by the tree of life remember what i warn thee shun to taste and shun the bitter consequence for know the day thou eatest thereof my sole command transgressed inevitably thou shalt die from that day mortal and this happy state shalt lose expelled from hence into a world of woe and sorrow sternly he pronounced the rigid interdiction which resounds yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice not to incur but soon his clear aspect returned and gracious purpose thus renewed not only these fair bounds but all the earth to thee and to thy raze i give as lords possess it and all things that therein live or live in sea or air beast fish and foul in sign whereof each bird and beast behold after their kinds i bring them to receive from thee their names and pay thee fealty with low subjection understand the same of fish within their watery residence not hither summoned since they cannot change their element to draw the thinner air as thus he spoke each bird and beast behold approaching two and two these cowering low with blandishment each bird stooped on his wing i named them as they passed and understood their nature with such knowledge god endued my sudden apprehension but in these i found not what me thought i wanted still and to the heavenly vision thus presumed o by what name for thou above all these above mankind or aught then mankind higher surpassest far my naming how may i adore thee author of this universe and all this good to man for whose well being so amply and with hands so liberal thou hast provided all things but with me i see not who partakes in solitude what happiness who can enjoy alone or all enjoying what contentment find thus i presumptuous and the vision bright as with a smile more bright'nd thus replied what callest thou solitude is not the earth with various living creatures and the air replenished and all these at thy command to come and play before thee knowest thou not their language and their ways they also know and reason not contemptibly with these find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large so spoke the universal lord and seemed so ordering i with leave of speech implored and humble deprecation thus replied let not my words offend thee heavenly power my maker be propitious while i speak hast thou not made me here thy substitute and these inferior far beneath me set among unequals what society can sort what harmony or true delight which must be mutual in proportion due given and received but in disparity the one intense the other still remiss cannot well suit with either but soon prove tedious alike of fellowship i speak such as i seek fit to participate all rational delight wherein the brutus cannot be human consort they rejoice each with their kind lion with lioness so fitly them in pairs thou hast combined much less can bird with beast or fish with foul so well converse nor with the ox the ape worse then can man with beast and least of all whereto the almighty answered not displeased a nice and subtle happiness i see thou to thy self proposest in the choice of thy associates adam and wilt taste no pleasure though in pleasure solitary what thinkest thou then of me and this my state seem i to thee sufficiently possessed of happiness or not who am alone from all eternity for none i know second to me or like equal much less how have i then with whom to hold converse save with the creatures which i made and those to me inferior infinite descents beneath what other creatures are to thee he ceased i lowly answered to attain the highth and depth of thy eternal ways all human thoughts come short supreme of things thou in thy selt art perfect and in thee is no deficience found not so is man but in degree the cause of his desire by conversation with his like to help or solace his defects no need that thou shouldst propagate already infinite and through all numbers absolute though one but man by number is to manifest his single imperfection and beget like of his like his image multiplied in unity defective which requires collateral love and dearest amity thou in thy secrecy although alone best with thy self accompanied seekest not social communication yet so pleased canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt of union or communion deified i by conversing cannot these erect from prove nor in their ways complacence find thus i embold'nd spoke and freedom used permissive and acceptance found which gained this answer from the gracious voice divine thus far to try thee adam i was pleased and find thee knowing not of beasts alone which thou hast rightly named but of thy self expressing well the spirit within thee free my image not imparted to the brutus whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike and be so minded still i ere thou spakest knew it not good for man to be alone and no such company as then thou sawest intended thee for trial only brought to see how thou couldst judge of fit and meet what next i bring shall please thee be assured thy likeness thy fit help thy other self thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire he ended or i herd no more for now my earthly by his heavenly overpowerd which it had long stood under strained to the highth in that celestial colloquy sublime as with and object that excels the sense dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair of sleep which instantly fell on me called by nature as in aid and closed mine eyes mine eyes he closed but op'n left the cell of fancy my internal sighed by which abstract as in a transe methought i saw though sleeping where i lay and saw the shape still glorious before whom awake i stood who stooping op'nd my left side and took from thence a rib with cordial spirits warm and lifeblood streaming fresh wide was the wound but suddenly with flesh filled up and healed the rib he formed and fashond with his hands under his forming hands a creature grew manlike but different sex so lovly fair that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now mean or in her summed up in her contained and in her looks which from that time infused sweetness into my heart unfelt before and into all things from her air inspired the spirit of love and amorous delight shee disappeerd and left me dark i waked to find her or for ever to deplore her loss and other pleasures all abjure when out of hope behold her not far off such as i saw her in my dream adorned with what all earth or heaven could bestow to make her amiable on she came led by her heavenly maker though unseen and guided by his voice nor uninformed of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye in every gesture dignity and love i overjoyed could not forbear aloud this turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled thy words creator bounteous and benign giver of all things fair but fairest this of all thy gifts nor enviest i now see bone of my bone flesh of my flesh my self before me woman is her name of man extracted for this cause he shall forgo father and mother and to his wife adhere and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul she herd me thus and though divinely brought yet innocence and virgin modesty her virtue and the conscience of her worth that would be wooed and not unsought be wone not obvious not obtrusive but retired the more desirable or to say all nature her self though pure of sinful thought wrought in her so that seeing me she turned i followed her she what was honour knew and with obsequious majesty approved my pleaded reason to the nuptial bower i led her blushing like the morn all heaven and happy constellations on that hour shed their selectest influence the earth gave sign of gratulation and each hill joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs whispered it to the woods and from their wings flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub disporting till the amorous bird of night sung spousal and bid haste the eevning star on his hill top to light the bridal lamp thus i have told thee all ray state and brought my story to the sum of earthly bliss which i enjoy and must confess to find in all things else delight indeed but such as used or not works in the mind no change nor vehement desire these delicacies i mean of taste sighed smell herbs fruits and flours walks and the melody of birds but here fair otherwise transported i behold transported touch here passion first i felt commotion strange in all enjoyments else superior and unmoved here only weak against the charm of beauty's powerful glance or nature failed in me and left some part not proof enough such object to sustain or from my side subducting took perhaps more then enough at least on her bestowed too much of ornament in outward show elaborate of inward less exact for well i understand in the prime end of nature her the inferior in the mind and inward faculties which most excel in outward also her resembling less his image who made both and less expressing the character of that dominion given over other creatures yet when i approach her loveliness so absolute she seems and in her self complete so well to know her own that what she wills to do or say seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best all higher knowledge in her presence falls degraded wisdom in discourse with her looses discount'nanced and like folly shows authority and reason on her wait as one intended first not after made occasionally and to consummate all greatness of mind and nobleness their seat built in her loveliest and create and awe about her as a guard angelic placed to whom the angel with contracted brow accuse not nature she hath done her part do thou but thine and be not diffident of wisdom she deserts thee not if thou dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh by attributing overmuch to things less excellent as thou thy self perceav'st for what admirest thou what transports thee so and outside fair no doubt and worthy well thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love not thy subjection weigh with her thy self then valve oft times nothing profits more then self esteem grounded on just and right well managed of that skill the more thou knowest the more she will acknowledge thee her head and to realities yield all her shows made so adorn for thy delight the more so awful that with honour thou mayest love thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise but if the sense of touch whereby mankind is propagated seem such dear delight beyond all other think the same vouchsafed to cattle and each beast which would not be to them made common and divulged if aught therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue the soul of man or passion in him move what higher in her society thou findest attractive human rational love still in loving thou dost well in passion not wherein true love consists not love refines the thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat in reason and is judicious is the scale by which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause among the beasts no mate for thee was found to whom thus half abashed adam replied neither her outside formed so fair nor aught in procreation common to all kinds though higher of the genial bed by far and with mysterious reverence i deem so much delights me as those graceful acts those thousand decencies that daily flow from all her words and actions mixed with love and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned union of mind or in us both one soul harmony to behold in wedded pair more grateful then harmonious found to the ear yet these subject not i to thee disclose what inward thence i feel not therefore foiled who meet with various objects from the sense variously representing yet still free approve the best and follow what i approve to love thou blamest me not for love thou sayest leads up to heaven is both the way and guide bear with me then if lawful what i ask love not the heavenly spirits and how their love express they by looks only or do they mix irradiance virtual or immediate touch to whom the angel with a smile that glowed celestial rosy read loves proper hue answered let it suffice thee that thou knowest us happy and without love no happiness whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest and pure thou wertenberg created we enjoy in eminence and obstacle find none of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars easier then air with air if spirits embrace total they mix union of pure with pure desiring nor restrained conveyance need as flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul. but i can now no more the parting sun beyond the earth's green cape and verdant isles hesperean sets my signal to depart be strong live happy and love but first of all him whom to love is to obey and keep his great command take heed least passion sway thy judgement to do aught which else free will would not admit thine and of all thy sons the weal or woe in thee is placed beware i in thy persevering shall rejoice and all the blessed stand fast to stand or fallen free in thine own arbitrement it lies perfect within no outward aid require and all temptation to transgress repel so saying he arose whom adam thus followed with benediction since to part go heavenly guest ethereal messenger sent from whose sovran goodness i adore gentle to me and affable hath been thy condescension and shall be honoured ever with grateful memory thou to mankind be good and friendly still and oft return so parted they the angel up to heaven from the thick shade and adam to his bower the end of the eighth book paradise lost. book ix the argument satan having compassed the earth with meditated guile returns as a missed by night into paradise enters into the serpent sleeping adam and eve in the morning go forth to their labours which eve proposes to divide in several places each labouring apart adam consents not alleging the danger lest that enemy of whom they were forewarned should attempt her found alone eve loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough urges her going apart the rather desirous to make trial of her strength adam at last yields the serpent finds her alone his subtle approach first gazing then speaking with much flattery extolling eve above all other creatures eve wondering to hear the serpent speaks asks how he attained to human speech and such understanding not till now the serpent answers that by tasting of a certain tree in the garden he attained both to speech and reason till then void of both eve requires him to bring her to that tree and finds it to be the tree of knowledge forbidden the serpent now grown bolder with many wiles and arguments induces her at length to eat she pleased with the taste deliberates a while whither to impart thereof to adam or not at last brings him of the fruit relates what persuaded her to eat thereof adam at first amazed but perceiving her lost resolves through vehemence of love to perish with her and extenuating the trespass cats also of the fruit the effects thereof in them both they seek to cover their nakedness then fallen to variance and accusation of one anotther no more of talk where god or angel guest with man as with his friend familiar used to fit indulgent and with him partake

heaven now alienated distance and distaste anger and just rebuke and judgement given that brought into this world a world of woe sin and her shadow death and misery death's harbinger sad task yet argument not less but more heroic then the wrauth of stern achilles on his foe pursued thrice fugitive about troy wall or rage of turnus for lavinia disespoused or neptun's ire or juno's that so long perplexed the greek and cytherea's son if answerable style i can obtain of my celestial patroness who deigns her nightly visitation unimplored and dictates to me slumbering or inspires easy my unpremeditated verse since first this subject for heroic song pleased me long choosing and beginning late not sedulous by nature to indite wars hitherto the only argument heroic deemed chief mastery to dissect with long and tedious havoc fabled knights in battles feigned the better fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom unsung or to describe races and games or tilting furniture emblazoned

age too late or cold climate or years damp my intended wing depressed and much they may if all be mine not hers who brings it nightly to my ear the sun was sunk and after him the star of hesperus whose office is to bring twilight upon the earth short arbiter betwixt day and night and now from end to end nights hemisphere had veiled the horizon round when satan who late fled before the threats of gabriel out of eden now improved in meditated fraud and malice bent on men destruction maugre what might hap of heavier on himself fearless returned by night he fled and at midnight returned from compassing the earth cautious of day since ʋriel regent of the sun descried his entrance and forewarned the cherubin that kept their watch thence full of anguish driven the space of seven continued nights he road with darkness thrice the equinoctial line he circled four times crossed the carr of night from pole to pole traversing each colour on the eighth returned and on the coast averse from entrance or cherubic watch by stealth found unsuspected way there was a place now not though since not time first wraught the change where tigris at the foot of paradise into a gulf shot under ground till part rose up a fountain by the tree of life in with the river sunk and with it rose satan involved in rising missed then sought where to lie hid sea he had searched and land from eden over pontus and the pool maeotis up beyond the river ob downward as far antarctic and in length west from orontes to the ocean barred at darien thence to the land where flows ganges and indus thus the orb he roamed with narrow search and with inspection deep considered every creature which of all most opportune might serve his wiles and found the serpent subtlest beast of all the field him after long debate irresolute of thoughts revolved his final sentence chosen fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom to enter and his dark suggestions hide from sharpest sighed for in the wily snake whatever sleights none would suspicious mark as from his wit and native subtlety proceeding which in other beasts observed doubt might beget of diabolic power active within beyond the sense of brutus thus he resolved but first from inward grief his bursting passion into plaints thus poured oh earth how like to heaven if not preferred more justly seat worthier of gods as built with second thoughts reforming what was old for what god after better worse would built terrestrial heaven danced round by other heavens that shine yet bear their bright officious lamps light above light for thee alone as seems in thee concentring all their precious beams of sacred influence as god in heaven is centre ▪ yet extends to all so thou centring receav'st from all those orbs in thee not in themselves all their known virtue appears productive in herb plant and nobler birth of creatures animate with gradual life of growth sense reason all summed up in man. with what delight could i have walked thee round if i could joy in aught sweet interchange of hill and valley rivers woods and plains now land now sea and shores with forest crowned rocks dens and caves but i in none of these find place or refuge and the more i see pleasures about me so much more i feel torment within me as from the hateful siege of contraries all good to me becomes bane and in heaven much worse would be my state but neither here seek i no nor in heaven to dwell unless by mastering heavens supreme nor hope to be my self less miserable by what i seek but others to make such as i though thereby worse to me redound for only in destroying i find ease to my relentless thoughts and him destroyed or wone to what may work his utter loss for whom all this was made all this will soon follow as to him linked in weal or woe in woe then that destruction wide may range to me shall be the glory sole among the infernal powers in one day to have marred what he almighty styled six nights and days continued making and who knows how long before had been contriving though perhaps not longer then since i in one night freed from servitude inglorious wellnigh half the angelic name and thinner left the throng of his adorers ▪ he to be avenged and to repair his numbers thus impaired whither such virtue spent of old now failed more angels to create if they at least are his created or to spite us more determined to advance into our room a creature formed of earth and him endow exalted from so base original with heavenly spoils our spoils what he decreed ▪ he effected man he made and for him built magnificent this world and earth his seat him lord pronounced and oh indignity subjected to his service angel wings and flaming ministers to watch and tend their earthy charge of these the vigilance i dread and to elude thus wrapped in missed of midnight vapor glide obscure and pry in every bush and brake where hap may find the serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds to hide me and the dark intent i bring o foul descent that i who erst contended with gods to fit the highest am now constrained into a beast and mixed with bestial slime this essence to incarnate and imbrute that to the hight of deity aspired but what will not ambition and revenge descend to who aspires must down as low as high he soared obnoxious first or last to basest things revenge at first though sweet bitter ere long back on it self recoils let it i reck not so it light well aimed since higher i fallen short on him who next provokes my envy this new favourite of heaven this man of clay son of despite whom us the more to spite his maker raised from dust spite then with spite is best repaid so saying through each thicket danck or dry like a black missed low creeping he held on his midnight search where soonest he might find the serpent him fast sleeping soon he found in labyrinth of many a round self-rolled his head the midst well stored with subtle wiles not yet in horrid shade or dismal den nor nocent yet but on the grassy herb fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth the devil entered and his brutal sense in heart or head possessing soon inspired with act intelligential but his sleep disturbed not waiting close the approach of morn now when as sacred light began to dawn in eden on the humid flours that breathed their morning incense when all things that breath from the earth's great altar send up silent praise to the creator and his nostrils fill with grateful smell forth came the human pair and joined their vocal worship to the choir of creatures wanting voice that done partake the season prime for sweetest sents and airs then commune how that day they best may ply their growing work for much their work outgrew the hands dispatch of two gardening so wide and eve first to her husband thus began adam well may we labour still to dress this garden still to tend plant herb and flour our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands aid us the work under our labour grows luxurious by restraint ▪ what we by day lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind one night or two with wanton growth derides tending to wild thou therefore now advice or bear what to my mind first thoughts present let us divide our labours thou where choice leads thee or where most needs whither to wind the woodbine round this arbour or direct the clasping ivy where to climb while i in yonder spring of roses intermixed with myrtle find what to redress till noon for while so near each other thus all day our task we choose what wonder if so near looks intervene and smiles or object new casual discourse draw on which intermits our days work brought to little though begun early and the hour of supper comes unearned to whom mild answer adam thus returned sold eve associate sole to me beyond compare above all living creatures deer well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed how we might best fulfil the work which here god hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found in woman then to study household good and good works in her husband to promote yet not so strictly hath our lord imposed labour ▪ as to debar us when we need refreshment whither food or talk between food of the mind or this sweet intercourse of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow to brutus denied and are of love the food love not the lowest end of human life for not to irksome toil but to delight he made us and delight to reason joined these paths & bowers doubt not but our joint hands will keep from wilderness with ease as wide as we need walk till younger hands ere long assist us but if much converse perhaps thee satiate to short absence i could yield for solitude sometimes is best society and short retirement urge sweet return but other doubt possesses me lest harm befall thee severed from me for thou knowest what hath been warned us what malicious foe envying our happiness and of his own despairing seeks to work us woe and shame by sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand watches no doubt with greedy hope to find his wish and best advantage us asunder hopeless to circumvent us joined where each to other speedy aid might lend at need whither his first design be to withdraw our fealty from god or to disturb conjugal love then which perhaps no bliss enjoyed by us excites his envy more or this or worse leave not the faithful side that gave thee being still shades thee and protects the wife where danger or dishonour lurks safest and seemliest by her husband stays who guards her or with her the worst endures to whom the virgin majesty of eve as one who loves and some unkindness meets with sweet austere composure thus replied offspring of heaven and earth and all earth's lord that such and enemy we have who seeks our ruin both by thee informed i learn and from the parting angel overheard as in a shady nook i stood behind just then returned at shut of evening flours but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt to god or thee because we have a foe may tempt it i expected nor to hear his violence thou fearest not being such as we not capable of death or pain can either not receive or can repel his fraud is then thy fear which plain infers thy equal fear that my firm faith and love can by his fraud be shak'n or seduced thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast adam missthought of her to thee so dear to whom with healing words adam replied daughter of god and man immortal eve for such thou art from since and blame entire not diffident of thee do i dissuade thy absence from my sighed but to avoid the attempt it self intended by our foe for he who tempts though in vain at least asperses the tempted with dishonour foul supposed not incorruptible of faith not proof against temptation thou thy self with scorn and anger wouldst resent the offered wrong though ineffectual found misdeem not then if such affront i labour to avert from thee alone which on us both at once the enemy though bold will hardly dare or daring first on me the assault shall light nor thou his malice and false guile contemn subtle he needs must be who could seduce angels nor think superfluous others aid i from the influence of thy looks receive access in every virtue in thy sighed more wise more watchful stronger if need were of outward strength while shame thou looking on shame to be overcome or overreached would utmost vigor raise and raised unite why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel when i am present and thy trial choose with me best witness of thy virtue tried so spoke domestic adam in his care and matrimonial love but eve who thought less attributed to her faith sincere thus her reply with accent sweet renewed if this be our condition thus to dwell in narrow circuit strait'nd by a foe subtle or violent we not endued single with like defence wherever met how are we happy still in fear of harm but harm precedes not since only our foe tempting affronts us with his foul esteem of our integrity his foul esteem sticks no dishonour on our front but turns foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared by us who rather double honour gain from his surmise proved false find peace within favour from heaven our witness from the event and what is faith love virtue unassayed alone without exterior help sustained let us not then suspect our happy state left so imperfet by the maker wise as not secure to single or combined frail is our happiness if this be so and eden were not eden thus exposed to whom thus adam fervently replied o woman best are all things as the will of god ordained them his creating hand

sought where any tuft of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay their tendance or plantation for delight by fountain or by shady rivulet he sought them both but wished his hap might find eve separate he wished but not with hope of what so seldom chanced when to his wish beyond his hope eve separate he spies veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood half spied so thick the roses bushing round

awful brow more awful thus retired fairest resemblance of thy maker fair thee all things living gaze on all things thine by gift and thy celestial beauty adore with ravishment beheld there best beheld where universally admired but here in this enclosure wild these beasts among beholders rude and shallow to discern half what in thee is fair one man except who sees thee and what is one who shouldst be seen a goddess among gods adored and served by angels numberless thy daily train so glozed the tempter and his proem tuned into the heart of eve his words made way though at the voice much marvelling at length not unamazed she thus in answer spoke what may this mean language of man pronounced by tongue of brute and human sense expressed the first at lest of these i thought denied to beasts whom god on their creation-day created mute to all articulate found the latter i demur for in their looks much reason and in their actions oft appears thee serpent subtlest beast of all the field i knew but not with human voice endued redouble then this miracle and say how camest thou speakable of mute and how to me so friendly grown above the rest of brutal kind that daily are in sighed say for such wonder claims attention due to whom the guileful tempter thus replied empress of this fair world resplendent eve easie to me it is to tell thee all what thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed i was at first as other beasts that graze the trodden herb of abject thoughts and low as was my food nor aught but food discerned or sex and apprehended nothing high till on a day roving the field i chanced a goodly tree far distant to behold loaded with fruit of fairest colours mixed ruddy and gold i nearer drew to gaze when from the boughs a savoury odour blown grateful to appetite more pleased my sense then smell of sweetest fennel or the teats of ewe or goat dropping with milk at eevn unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play to satisfy the sharp desire i had of tasting those fair apples i resolved not to defer hunger and thirst at once powerful persuaders quick'nd at the scent of that alluring fruit urged me so keen about the mossy trunk i wound me soon for high from ground the branches would require thy utmost reach or adams round the tree all other beasts that saw with like desire longing and envying stood but could not reach amid the tree now god where plenty hung tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill i spared not for such pleasure till that hour at feed or fountain never had i found sated at length ere long i might perceive strange alteration in me to degree of reason in my inward powers and speech wanted not long though to this shape retained thenceforth to speculations high or deep i turned my thoughts and with capacious mind considered all things visible in heaven or earth or middle all things fair and good but all that fair and good in thy divine semblance and in thy beauty's heavenly ray united i beheld no fair to thine equivalent or second which compelled me thus though importune perhaps to come and gaze and worship thee of right declared sovran of creatures universal dame so talked the spirited sly snake and eve yet more amazed unwary thus replied serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt the virtue of that fruit in thee first proved but say where grows the tree from hence how far for many are the trees of god that grow in paradise and various yet unknown to us in such abundance lies our choice as leaves a greater store of fruit untouched still hanging incorruptible till men grow up to their provision and more hands help to disburden nature of her berth to whom the wily adder blithe and glad empress the way is ready and not long beyond a row of myrtles on a flat fast by a fountain one small thicket past of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept my conduct i can bring thee thither soon led then said eve he leading swiftly rolled in tangles and made intricate seem strait to mischief swift hope elevates and joy bright'ns his crest as when a wandering fire compact of unctuous vapor which the night condenses and the cold environs round kindled through agitation to a flame which oft they say some evil spirit attends hovering and blazing with delusive light misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way to boggs and mires and oft through pond or pool there swallowed up and lost from succour far so glistered the dire snake and into fraud led eve our credulous mother to the tree of prohibition root of all our woe which when she saw thus to her guide she spoke serpent we might have spared our coming hither fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess the credit of whose virtue rest with thee wondrous indeed if cause of such effects but of this tree we may not taste nor touch god so commanded and left that command sole daughter of his voice the rest we live law to our selves our reason is our law to whom the tempter guilefully replied indeed hath god then said that of the fruit of all these garden trees you shall not eat yet lords declared of all in earth or air to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit of each tree in the garden we may eat but of the fruit of this fair tree amid the garden god hath said you shall not eat thereof nor shall you touch it lest you die she scarce had said though brief when now more the tempter but with show of zeal and love to man and indignation at his wrong new part puts on and as to passion moved fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act raised as of some great matter to begin as when of old some orator renowned in athens or free room where eloquence flourishd since mute to some great cause addressed stood in himself collected while each part motion each act wone audience ere the tongue sometimes in highth began as no delay of preface brooking through his zeal of right so standing moving or to highth upgrown the tempter all impassioned thus began o sacred wise and wisdom-giving plant mother of science now i feel thy power within me clear not only to discern things in their causes but to trace the ways of highest agents deemed however wise queen of this universe do not believe those rigid threats of death you shall not die how should you by the fruit it gives you life to knowledge by the threatener look on me me who have touched and tasted yet both live and life more perfect have attained then fate meant me by vending higher then my lot shall that be shut to man which to the beast is open or will god incense his ire for such a petty trespass and not praise rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain of death denounced whatever thing death be deterred not from achieving what might lead to happier life knowledge of good and evil of good how just of evil if what is evil be real why not known since easier shunnd god therefore cannot hurt you and be just not just not god not feared then nor obeyed your fear it self of death removes the fear why then was this forbid why but to awe why but to keep you low and ignorant his worshippers he knows that in the day you eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear yet are but dim shall perfectly be then op'nd and cleerd and you shall be as gods knowing both good and evil as they know that you should be as gods since i as man internal man is but proportion meet i of brutus human ye of human gods. so you shall die perhaps by putting off human to put on gods death to be wished though threat'nd which not worse then this can bring and what are gods that man may not become as they participating godlike food the gods are first and that advantage use on our belief that all from them proceeds i question it for this fair earth i see warmed by the sun producing every kind them nothing if they all things who enclosed knowledge of good and evil in this tree that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains wisdom without their leave and wherein lies the offence that man should thus attain to know what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree impart against his will it all be his or is it envy and can envy dwell in heavenly breasts these these and many more causes import your need of this fair fruit. goddess humane reach then and freely taste he ended and his words replete with guile into her heart too easy entrance wone fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold might tempt alone and in her cars the found yet rung of his persuasive words impregned with reason to her seeming and with truth mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked and eager appetite raised by the smell so savoury of that fruit which with desire inclinable now grown to touch or taste solicited her longing eye yet first pausing a while thus to her self she mused great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits though kept from man and worthy to be admired whose taste too long forborn at first assay gave elocution to the mute and taught the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise thy praise he also who forbids thy use conceals not from us naming thee the tree of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil forbids us then to taste but his forbidding commends thee more while it infers the good by thee communicated and our want for good unknown sure is not had or had and yet unknown is as not had at all in plain then what forbids he but to know forbids us good forbids us to be wise such prohibitions bind not but if death bind us with after-bands what profits then our inward freedom in the day we eat of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die how die the serpent he hath eaten and lives and knows and speaks and reasons and discerns irrational till then for us alone was death invented or to us denied this intellectual food for beasts reserved for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first hath tasted envies not but brings with joy the good befallen him author unsuspect friendly to man far from deceit or guile what fear i then rather what know to fear under this ignorance of good and evil of god or death of law or penalty here grows the cure of all this fruit divine fair to the eye inviting to the taste of virtue to make wise what hinders then to reach and feed at once both body and mind so saying her rash hand in evil hour forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat earth felt the wound and nature from her seat sighing through all her works gave signs of woe that all was lost back to the thicket slunk the guilty serpent and well might for eve intern now wholly on her taste nought else regarded such delight till then as seemed in fruit she never tasted whither true or fancied so through expectation high of knowledge nor was godhead from her thought greedily she ingorged without restraint and knew not eating death satiate at length and hight'nd as with wine jocund and boon thus to her self she pleasingly began o sovran virtuous precious of all trees in paradise of operation blessed to sapience hitherto obscured infamed and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end created but henceforth my early care not without song each morning and due praise shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease of thy full branches offered free to all till dieted by thee i grow mature in knowledge as the gods who all things know though others envy what they cannot give for had the gift been theirs it had not here thus grown experience next to thee i owe best guide not following thee i had remained in ignorance thou op'nst wisdoms way and givest access though secret she retire and i perhaps am secret heaven is high high and remote to see from thence distinct each thing on earth and other care perhaps may have diverted from continual watch our great forbidder safe with all his spies about him but to adam in what sort shall i appear shall i to him make known as yet my change and give him to partake full happiness with me or rather not but keep the odds of knowledge in my power without copartner so to add what wants in female sex the more to draw his love and render me more equal and perhaps a thing not undesirable sometime superior for inferior who is free this may be well but what if god have seen and death ensue then i shall be no more and adam wedded to another eve shall live with her enjoying i extinct a death to think confirmed then i resolve adam shall share with me in bliss or woe so dear i love him that with him all death's i could endure without him five no life so saying from the tree her step she turned but first low reverence done as to the power that dwelled within whose presence had infused into the plant sciential sap derived from nectar drink of gods. adam the while waiting desirous her return had wove of choicest flours a garland to adorn her tresses and her rural labours crown as reapers oft are wont their harvest queen great joy he promised to his thoughts and new solace in her return so long delayed yet oft his heart divine of something ill misgave him he the faltering measure felt and forth to meet her went the way she took that morn when first they parted by the tree of knowledge he must pass there he her met scarce from the tree returning in her hand a bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled new gathered and ambrosial smell diffused to him she hasted in her face excuse came prologue and apology to prompt which with bland words at will she thus addressed hast thou not wondered adam at my stay thee i have misst and thought it long deprived thy presence agony of love till now not felt nor shall be twice for never more mean i to try what rash untried i sought the pain of absence from thy sighed but strange hath been the cause and wondered to hear this tree is not as we are told a tree of danger tasted nor to evil unknown opening the way but of divine effect to open eyes and make them gods who taste and hath been tasted such the serpent wise or not restrained as we or not obeying hath eaten of the fruit and is become not dead as we are threatened but thenceforth endued with human voice and human sense reasoning to admiration and with me persuasively hath so prevailed that i have also tasted and have also found the effects to correspond opener mine eyes dimm erst dilated spirits ampler heart and growing up to godhead which for thee chiefly i sought without thee can despise for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss tedious unshared with thee and odious soon thou therefore also taste that equal lot may join us equal joy as equal love lest thou not tasting different degree disjoin us and i then too late renounce deity for thee when fate will not permit thus eve with countenance blithe her story told but in her cheek distemper flushing glowed on the other side adam soon as he herd the fatal trespass done by eve amazed astonished stood and blank while horror chill ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed from his slack hand the garland wreathed for eve down dropped and all the faded roses shed speechless he stood and pale till thus at length first to himself he inward silence broke o fairest of creation last and best of all gods works creature in whom excelled whatever can to sighed or thought be formed holy divine good amiable or sweet how art thou lost how on a sudden lost defaced deflourd and now to death devote rather how hast thou yielded to transgress the strict forbiddance how to violate the sacred fruit forbidden some cursed fraud of enemy hath be guiled thee yet unknown and me with thee hath ruined for with thee certain my resolution is to die how can i live without thee how forgo thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined to live again in these wild woods forlorn should god create another eve and i another rib afford yet loss of thee would never from my heart no no i feel the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh bone of my bone thou art and from thy state mine never shall be parted bliss or woe so having said as one from sad dismay recomforted and after thoughts disturbed submitting to what seemed remediless thus in calm mood his words to eve he turned bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous eve and peril great provoked who thus hath dared had it been only coveting to eye that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence much more to taste it under ban to touch but past who can recall or done undo not god omnipotent nor fate yet so perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact is not so heinous now foretasted fruit profaned first by the serpent by him first made common and unhallowd ere our taste nor yet on him found deadly he yet lives lives as thou saidst and gains to live as man higher degree of life inducement strong to us as likely tasting to attain proportional ascent which cannot be but to be gods or angels demigods nor can i think that god creator wise though threatening will in earnest so destroy us his prime creatures dignified so high set over all his works which in our fallen for us created needs with us must fail dependent made so god shall uncreate be frustrate do undo and labour lose not well conceived of god who though his power creation could repeat yet would be loath us to abolish lest the adversary triumph and say fickle their state whom god most favors who can please him long me first he ruined now mankind whom will he next matter of scorn not to be given the foe however i with thee have fixed my lot certain to undergo like doom if death consort with thee death is to me as life so forcible within my heart i feel the bound of nature draw me to my own my own in thee for what thou art is mine our state cannot be severed we are one one flesh to lose thee were to lose my self so adam and thus eve to him replied o glorious trial of exceeding love illustrious evidence example high i engaging me to emulate but short of thy perfection how shall i attain adam from whose deer side i boast me sprung and gladly of our union hear thee speak one heart one soul in both whereof good proof this day affords declaring thee resolved rather then death or aught then death more dread shall separate us linked in love so deer to undergo with me one gilded one crime if any be of tasting this fair fruit whole virtue for of good still good proceeds direct or by occasion hath presented this happy trial of thy love which else so eminently never had been known were it i thought death menaced would ensue this my attempt i would sustain alone the worst and not persuade thee rather die deserted then oblige thee with a fact pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured remarkably so late of thy so true so faithful love unequaled but i feel far otherwise the event not death but life augmented op'nd eyes new hope's new joys taste so divine that what of sweet before hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh on my experience adam freely taste and fear of death deliver to the winds so saying she embraced him and for joy tenderly wept much wone that he his love had so ennobled as of choice to incur divine displeasure for her sake or death in recompense for such compliance bade such recompen best merits from the bough she gave him of that fair enticing fruit with liberal hand he scrupled not to eat against his better knowledge not deceived but fondly overcome with female charm earth trembled from her entrails as again in pangs and nature gave a second groan sky lower and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completing of the mortal since original while adam took no thought eating his fill nor eve to iterate her former trespass feared the more to sooth him with her loved society that now as with new wine intoxicated both they swim in mirth and fancy that they feel divinity within them breeding wings wherewith to scorn the earth but that false fruit far other operation first displayed carnal desire enflaming he on eve began to cast lascivious eyes she him as wantonly repaid in lust they burn till adam thus begin eve to dalliance move eve now i see thou art exact of taste and elegant of sapience no small part since to each meaning savour me apply and palate call judicious i the praise yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed much pleasure we have lost while we abstained from this delightful fruit nor known till now true relish tasting if such pleasure be in things to us forbidden it might be wished for this one tree had been forbidden ten but come so well refreshed now let us play as me is after such delicious fare for never did thy beauty since the die i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned with all perfections so inflame my sense with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now then ever bounty of this virtuous tree so said he and forbore not glance or toy of amorous intent well understood of eve whose eye darted contagious fire her hand he seized and to a shady bank thick overhead with verdant roof imbowred he led her nothing loath flours were the couch pansies and violets and asphodel and hyacinth earth's freshest softest lap there they their fill of love and loves disport took largely of their mutual guilt the scale the solace of their since till dewy sleep oppressed them wearied with their amorous play soon as the force of that fallacious fruit that with exhilarating vapour bland about their spirits had played and inmost powers made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams encumberd now had left them up they rose as from unrest and each the other viewing soon found their eyes how op'nd and their minds how dark'nd innocence that as a veil had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone just confidence and native righteousness and honour from about them naked left to guilty shame he covered but his robe uncovered more so rose the danite strong herculean samson from the harlot-lap of philistean dalilah and waked shorn of his strength they destitute and bore of all their virtue silent and in face confounded long they sat as struck'n mute till adam though not less then eve abashed at length gave utterance to these words constrained o eve in evil hour thou didst give ear to that false worm of whomsoever taught to counterfeit men voice true in our fallen false in our promised rising since our eyes op'nd we find indeed and find we know both good and evil good lost and evil god bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know which leaves us naked thus of honour void of innocence of faith of purity our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained and in our faces evident the signs of foul concupiscence whence evil store even shame the last of evils of the first be sure then how shall i behold the face henceforth of god or angel erst with joy and rapture so oft beheld those heavenly shapes will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze insufferably bright o might i here in solitude live savage in some glade obscured where highest woods impenetrable to star or sunlight spread their umbrage broad and brown as evening cover me you pines you cedars with innumerable boughs hide me where i may never see them more but let us now as in bad plighted devise what best may from the present serve to hide the parts of each for other that seem most to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sowd and girded on our loins may cover round those middle parts that this new commer shame there fit not and reproach us as unclean so counseled he and both together went into the thickest wood there soon they chosen the figtree not that kind for fruit renowned but such as at this day to indians known in malabar or decan spreads her arms branching so broad and long that in the ground the bent twigs take root and daughters grow about the mother tree a pillard shade high overarched and echoing walks between there oft the indian herdsman shunning heat shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds at loopholes cut through thiekest shade those leaves they gathered broad as amazonian targe and with what skill they had together sowd to gird their waste vain covering if to hide their guilt and dreaded shame oh how unlike to that first naked glory such of late columbus found the american so girded with feathered cincture naked else and wild among the trees on lies and woody shores thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part covered but not at rest or ease of mind they sat them down to weep nor only tears reigned at their eyes but high winds worse within began to rise high passion anger hate mistrust suspicion discord and shook soar their inward state of mind calm region once and full of peace now tossed and turbulent for understanding ruled not and the will herd not her lore both in subjection now to sensual appetite who from beneath usurping over sovran reason claimed superior sway from thus distempered breast adam estranged in look and altered style speech intermitted thus to eve renewed would thou hadst heark'nd to my words and stayed with me as i besought thee when that strange desire of wandering this unhappy morn i know not whence possessd thee we had then remained still happy not as now despoiled of all our good shamed naked miserable let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve the faith they owe when earnestly they seek such proof conclude they then begin to fail to whom soon moved with touch of blame thus eve what words have passed thy lips adam severe imputest thou that to my default or will of wandering as thou callest it which who knows but might as ill have happ'nd thou being by or to thy self perhaps hadst thou been there or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned fraud in the serpent speaking as he spoke no ground of enmity between us known why he should mean me ill or seek to harm was i to have never parted from thy side as good have grown there still a liveless rib. being as i am why didst not thou the head command me absolutely not to go going into such danger as thou saidst too facil then thou didst not much gainsay nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent neither had i transgressed nor thou with me to whom then first incensed adam replied is this the love is this the recompense of mine to thee ingrateful eve expressed immutable when thou wertenberg lost not i who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss yet willingly chosen rather death with thee and am i now upbraided as the cause of thy transgressing not enough severe it seems in thy restraint what could i more i warned thee i admonished thee foretold the danger and the lurking enemy that lay in wait beyond this had been force and force upon free will both here no place but confidence then boar thee on secure either to meet no danger or to find matter of glorious trial and perhaps i also erred in overmuch admiring what seemed in thee so perfect that i thought no evil durst attempt thee but i rue that error now which is become my crime and thou the accuser thus it shall befall him who to worth in women overtrusting lets her will rule restraint she will not brook and left to her self if evil thence ensue she first his weak indulgence will accuse thus they in mutual accusation spent the fruitless hours but neither self-condemning and of their vain contest appeared no end the end of the ninth book paradise lost. book x. the argument men transgression known the guardian angels forsake paradise and return up to heaven to approve their vigilance and are approved god declaring that the entrance of satan could not be by them prevented he sends his son to judge the transgressors who descends and gives sentence accordingly then in pity clothes them both and reascends since and death sitting till then at the gates of hell by wondrous sympathy feeling the success of satan in this new world and the since by man there committed resolve to fit no longer confined in hell but to follow satan their sire up to the place of man to make the way easier from hell to this world to and from they pave a broad highway or bridge over chaos according to the track that satan first made then preparing for earth they meet him proud of his success returning to hell their mutual gratulation satan arrives at pandemonium in full of assembly relates with boasting his success against man instead of applause is entertained with a general hiss by all his audience transformed with himself also suddenly into serpents according to his doom given in paradise then deluded with a show of the forbidden tree springing up before them

the present commands his angels to make several alterations in the heavens and elements adam more and more perceiving his fallen condition heavily bewails rejects the condolement of eve she persists and at length appeases him then to evade the curse likely to fallen on their offspring proposes to adam violent ways which he approves not but conceiving better hope puts her in mind of the late promise made them that her seed should be revenged on the serpent and exhorts her with him to seek peace of the offended deity by repentance and supplication meanwhile the heinous and despiteful act of satan done in paradise and how he in the serpent had perverted eve her husband she to taste the fatal fruit was known in heaven for what can escape the eye of god all-seeing or deceive his heart omniscient who in all things wise and just hindered not satan to attempt the mind of man with strength entire and free will armed complete to have discovered and repulsed whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend for still they knew and ought to have still remembered the high injunction not to taste that fruit whoever tempted which they not obeying incurred what could they less the penalty and

colleague with justice sending thee men friend his mediator his designed both ransom and redeemer voluntary and destined man himself to judge man fallen so spoke the father and unfolding bright towards the right hand his glory on the son blazed forth unclouded deity he full resplendent all his father manifest expressed and thus divinely answered mild father eternal thine is to decree mine both in heaven and earth to do thy will supreme that thou in me thy son beloved mayest ever rest well pleased i go to judge on earth these thy transgressors but thou knowest whoever judged the worst on me must light when time shall be for so i undertook before thee and not repenting this obtain of right that i may mitigate their doom on me derived yet i shall temper so justice with mercy as may illustrate most them fully satisfied and thee appease attendance none shall need nor train where none are to behold the judgement but the judged those two the third best absent is condemned convict by flight and rebel to all law conviction to the serpent none belongs thus saying from his radiant seat he rose of high collateral glory him thrones and powers princedoms and dominations ministrant accompanied to heaven gate from whence eden and all the coast in prospect lay down he descended strait the speed of gods time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged now was the sun in western cadence low from noon and gentle airs due at their hour to fan the earth now waked and usher in the eevning cool when he from wrauth more cool came the mild judge and intercessor both to sentence man the voice of god they herd now walking in the garden by soft winds brought to their ears while day declined they herd and from his presence hid themselves among the thickest trees both man and wife till god approaching thus to adam called aloud where art thou adam wont with joy to meet my coming seen far off i miss thee here not pleased thus entertained with solitude where obvious duty erewhile appeared unsaught or come i less conspicuous or what change absents thee or what chance detains come forth he came and with him eve more loath though first to offend discount'nanced both and discomposed love was not in their looks either to god or to each other but apparent guilt and shame and perturbation and despair anger and obstinacy and hate and guile whence adam faltering long thus answered brief i herd thee in the garden and of thy voice afraid being naked hid my self to whom the gracious judge without revile replied my voice thou oft hast herd and hast not feared but still rejoiced how is it now become so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat to whom thus adam soar beset replied o heaven in evil strait this day i stand before my judge either to undergo my self the total crime or to accuse my other self the partner of my life whose failing while her faith to me remains i should conceal and not expose to blame by my complaint but strict necessity subdues me and calamitous constraint lest on my head both since and punishment however insupportable be all devolved though should i hold my peace yet thou wouldst easily detect what i conccale this woman whom thou madest to be my help and gavest me as thy perfect gift so good so fit so acceptable so divine that from her hand i could suspect no ill and what she did whatever in it self her doing seemed to justify the deed she gave me of the tree and i did eat to whom the sovran presence thus replied was she thy god that her thou didst obey before his voice or was she made thy guide superior or but equal that to her thou didst resign thy manhood and the place wherein god set thee above her made of thee and for thee whose perfection far excelled hers in all real dignity adorned she was indeed and lovely to attract thy love not thy subjection and her gifts were such as under government well seemed unseemly to bear rule which was thy part and person hadst thou known thy self aright so having said he thus to eve in few say woman what is this which thou hast done to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelmed confessing soon yet not before her judge bold or loquacious thus abashed replied the serpent me beguiled and i did eat which when the lord god herd without delay to judgement he proceeded on the accused serpent though brutus unable to transfer the gilded on him who made him instrument of mischief and polluted from the end of his creation justly then accursed as vitiated in nature more to know concerned not man since he no further knew nor altered his offence yet god at last to satan first in since his doom applied though in mysterious terms judged as then best and on the serpent thus his curse let fallen because thou hast done this thou art accursed above all cattle each beast of the field upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life between thee and the woman i will put enmity and between thine and her seed her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel so spoke this oracle then verified when jesus son of mary second eve saw satan fallen like lightning down from heaven prince of the air then rising from his grave spoiled principalities and powers triumphed in open show and with ascension bright captivity led captive through the air the realm it self of satan long usurped whom he shall tread at last under our feet eevn he who now foretold his fatal bruise and to the woman thus his sentence turned thy sorrow i will greatly multiply by thy conception children thou shalt bring in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will thine shall submit he over thee shall rule on adam last thus judgement he pronounced because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy wife and eaten of the tree concerning which i charged thee saying thou shalt not eat thereof cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bred till thou return unto the ground for thou out of the ground waste taken know thy birth for dust thou art and shalt to dust return so judged he man both judge and saviour sent and that instant stroke of death denounced that day removed far off then pitying how they stood before him naked to the air that now must suffer change disdained not to begin thenceforth the from of servant to assume as when he washed his servants feet so now as father of his family he clad their nakedness with skins of beasts or slave or as the snake with youthful coat repaid and thought not much to cloth his enemies nor he their outward only with the skins of beasts but inward nakedness much more opprobrious with his robe of righteousness arraying covered from his father's sighed to him with swift ascent he up returned into his blissful bosom reassumed in glory as of old to him appeased all though allknowing what had passed with man recounted mixing intercession sweet meanwhile ere thus was sinned and judged on earth within the gates of hell sat since and death in counterview within the gates that now stood open wide belching outrageous flame far into chaos since the fiend passed through since opening who thus now to death began o son why fit we here each other viewing idly while satan our great author thrives in other world's and happier seat provides for us his offspring deer it cannot be but that success attends him if mishap ere this he had returned with fury driven by his avengers since no place like this can fit his punishment or their revenge methinks i feel new strength within me rise wings growing and dominion given me large beyond this deep whatever draws me on or sympathy or some connatural force powerful at greatest distance to unite with secret amiry things of like kind by secretest conveyance thou my shade inseparable must with me along for death from since no power can separate but least the difficulty of passing back stay his return perhaps over this gulf impassable impervious let us try adventurous work yet to thy power and mine not unagreeable to found a path over this main from hell to that new world where satan now prevails a monument of merit high to all the infernal host easing their passage hence for intercourse or transmigration as their lot shall led nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn by this new felt attraction and instinct whom thus the meager shadow answered soon go whither fate and inclination strong leads thee i shall not lag behind nor err the way thou leading suth a sent i draw of carnage prey innumerable and taste the savour of death from all things there that live nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest be wanting but afford thee equal aid so saying with delight he snuffed the smell of mortal change on earth as when a flock of ravenous fowl though many a league remote against the day of battle to a field where armies lie encamped come flying lured with sent of living carcases designed for death the following day in bloody fight so scented the grim feature and upturned his nostril wide into the murky air sagacious of his quarry from so far then both from out hell gates into the waste wide anarchy of chaos damp and dark flew diverse and with power their power was great hovering upon the waters what they met solid or slimy as in raging sea tossed up and down together crowded drove from each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell as when two polar winds blowing adverse upon the cronian sea together drive mountains of ice that stop the imagined way beyond petsora eastward to the rich cathaian coast the aggregated soil death with his mace petrific cold and dry as with a trident smote and fixed as firm as delos floating once the rest his look bound with gorgonian rigor not to move and with asphaltic slime broad as the gate deep to the roots of hell the gathered beach they fastened and the mole immense wraught on over the foaming deep high arched a bridge of length prodigious joying to the wall immovable of this now fenceless world forfeit to death from hence a passage broad smooth easy inoffensive down to hell so if great thing to small may be compared xerxes the liberty of greece to yoke from susa his momronian palace high came to the sea and over hellespont bridging his way europe with asia joined and scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves now had they brought the work by wondrous art pontifical a ridge of pendent rock over the vexed abyss following the track of satan ▪ to the self same place where he first lighted from his wing and landed safe from out of chaos to the out side bore of this round world with pins of adamant and chains they made all fast too fast they made and durable and now in little space the confines met of empyrean heaven and of this world and on the left hand hell with long reach interposed three several ways in sighed to each of these three places led and now their way to earth they had descried to paradise first tending when behold satan in likeness of and angel bright betwixt the centaur and the scorpion steering his zenith while the sun in aries rose disguised he came but those his children dear their parent soon discerned though in disguise he after eve seduced unminded slunk into the wood fast by and changing shape to observe the sequel saw his guileful act by eve though all unweeting seconded upon her husband saw their shame that sought vain covertures but when he saw descend the son of god to judge them terrified he fled not hoping to escape but shun the present fearing guilty what his wrauth might suddenly inflict that past returned by night and listening where the hapless pair sat in their sad discourse and various plaint thence gathered his own doom which understood not instant but of future time with joy and tidings fraught to hell he now returned and at the brink of chaos near the foot of this new wondrous pontifice unhoped met who to meet him came his offspring dear great joy was at their meeting and at sighed of that stupendious bridge his joy increased long he admiring stood till since his fair enchanting daughter thus the silence broke o parent these are thy magnific deeds thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own thou art their author and prime architect for i no sooner in my heart divined my heart which by a secret harmony still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet that thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks now also evidence but straight i felt though distant from thee world's between yet felt that i must after thee with this thy son such fatal consequence unites us three hell could no longer hold us in her bounds nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure detain from following thy illustrious track thou hast achieved our liberty confined within hell gates till now thou us empowered to fortify thus far and overlay with this portentous bridge the dark abyss thine now is and this world thy virtue hath wone what thy hands built not thy wisdom gained with odds what war hath lost and fully avenged our foil in heaven here thou shalt monarch reign there didst not there let him still victor sway as battle hath adjudged from this new world retiring by his own doom alienated and henceforth monarchy with thee divide of all things parted by the empyreal bounds his quadrature from thy orbicular world or try thee now more dangerous to his throne whom thus the prince of darkness answered glad fair daughter and thou son and grandchild both high proof you now have given to be the raze of satan for i glory in the name antagonist of heavens almighty king amply have merited of me of all the infernal empire that so near heavens door triumphal with triumphal act have met mine with this glorious work and made one realm hell and this world one realm one continent of easy thoroughfare therefore while i descend through darkness on your road with ease to my associate powers them to acquaint with these successes and with them rejoice you two this way among these numerous orbs all yours right down to paradise descend there dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth dominion exercise and in the air chiefly on man sole lord of all declared him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill my substitutes i send you and create plenipotent on earth of matchless might issuing from me on your joint vigor now my hold of this new kingdom all depends through since to death exposed by my exploit if your joint power prevails the affairs of hell no detriment need fear go and be strong so saying he dismissed them they with speed their course through thickest constellations held spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan and planets planet-strook real eclipse then suffered the other way satan went down the causey to hell gate on either side disparted chaos over built exclaimed and with rebounding surge the bars assailed that scorned his indignation through the gate wide open and unguarded satan passed and all about found desolate for those appointed to fit there had left their charge flown to the upper world the rest were all far to the inland retired about the walls of pandaemonium city and proud seat of lucifer so by allusion called of that bright star to satan paragond there kept their watch the legions while the grand in council sat solicitous what chance might intercept their emperor sent so he departing gave command and they observed as when the tartar from his russian foe by astracan over the snowy plains retires or bactri sophi from the horns of turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond the realm of aladule in his retreat to tauris or casbeen so these the late heaven-banished host left desert utmost hell many a dark league reduced in careful watch round their metropolis and now expecting each hour their great adventurer from the search of foreign world's he through the midst unmarked in show plebeian angel militant of lowest order past and from the door of that plutonian hall invisible ascended his high throne which under state of richest texture spread at the upper end was placed in regal lustre down a while he sat and round about him saw unseen at last as from a cloud his fulgent head and shape starr bright appeared or brighter clad with what permissive glory since his fallen was left him or false glitter all amazed at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld their mighty chief returned loud was the acclaim forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers raised from their dark divan and with like joy congratulant approached him who with hand silence and with these words attention wone thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers for in possession such not only of right i call you and declare you now returned successful beyond hope to led you forth triumphant out of this infernal pit abominable accursed the house of woe and dungeon of our tyrant now possess ▪ as lords a spacious world to our native heaven little inferior by my adventure hard with peril great achieved long were to tell what i have done what suffered with what pain voyaged the unreal vast unbounded deep of horrible confusion over which by since and death a broad way now is paved to expedite your glorious march but i toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride the untraceable abyss plunged in the womb of unoriginal night and chaos wild that jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed my journey strange with clamorous uproar protesting fate supreme thence how i found the new created world which same in heaven long had foretold a fabric wondered of absolute perfection therein man placed in a paradise by our exile made happy him by fraud i have seduced from his creator and the more to increase your wonder with and apple he thereat offended worth your laughter hath given up both his beloved man and all his world to since and death a prey and so to us without our hazard labour or alarm to range in and to dwell and over man to rule as over all he should have ruled true is me also he hath judged or rather me not but the brutus serpent in whose shape man i deceived that which to me belongs is enmity which he will put between me and mankind i am to bruise his heel his seed when is not set shall bruise my head a world who would not purchase with a bruise or much more grievous pain you have the account of my performance what remains you gods but up and enter now into full bliss so having said a while he stood expecting their universal shout and high applause to fill his ear when contrary he hears on all sides from innumerable tongues a dismal universal hiss the found of public scorn he wondered but not long had leisure wondering at himself now more his visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare his arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining each other till supplanted down he fell a monstrous serpent on his belly prove reluctant but in vain a greater power now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned according to his doom he would have spoke but hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue to forked tongue for now were all transformed alike to serpents all as accessories to his bold riot dreadful was the din of hissing through the hall thick swarming now with complicated monsters head and tail scorpion and asp and amphisbaena dire cerastes horned hydrus and ellops drear and dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil bedropt with blood of gorgon or the isle ophiusa but still greatest he the midst now dragon grown larger then whom the sun ingenderd in the pythian vale on slime huge python and his power no less he seemed above the rest still to retain they all him followed issuing forth to the open field where all yet left of that revolted rout heaven-fallen in station stood or just array sublime with expectation when to see in triumph issuing forth their glorious chief they saw but other sighed instead a crowd of ugly serpents horror on them fell and horrid sympathy for what they saw they felt themselves now changing down their arms down fell both spear and shield down they as fast and the dire hiss renewed and the dire from catched by contagion like in punishment as in their crime thus was the applause they meant turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame cast on themselves from their own mouths there stood a grove hard by sprung up with this their change his will who reigns above to aggravate their penance laden with fruit like that which grew in paradise the bait of eve used by the tempter on that prospect strange their earnest eyes they fixed imagining for one forbidden tree a multitude now ris'n to work them further woe or shame yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce though to delude them sent could not abstain but on thy rolled in heaps and up the trees climbing sat thicker then the snaky locks that curled megaera greedily they plucked the fruitage fair to sighed like that which grew near that bituminous lake where sodom flamed this more delusive not the touch but taste deceived they fondly thinking to allay their appetite with gust instead of fruit chewd bitter ashes which the offended taste with spattering noise rejected oft they assayed hunger and thirst constraining drugd as oft with hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws with soot and cinders filled so oft they fell into the same illusion not as man whom they triumphed once lapsed thus were they plagued and worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss till their lost shape permitted they resumed yearly enjoined some say to undergo this annual humbling certain numbered days to dash their pride and joy for man seduced however some tradition they dispersed among the heathen of their purchase god and fabled how the serpent whom they called ophion with eurynome the wide encroaching eve perhaps had first the rule of high olympus thence by saturn driven and ops ere yet dictaen jove was born mean while in paradise the hellish pair too soon arrived since there in power before once actual now in body and to dwell habitual habitant behind her death close following pace for pace not mounted yet on his pale horse to whom since thus began second of satan sprung all conquering death what thinkest thou of our empire now though earned with travail difficult not better far then still at hels dark threshold to have sat watch unnamed undreaded and thy self half starved whom thus the sin-born monster answered soon to me who with eternal famine pine alike is hell or paradise or heaven there best where most with ravine i may meet which here though plenteous all too little seems to stuff this maw this vast unhide-bound corpse to whom the incestuous mother thus replied thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flours feed first on each beast next and fish and foul no homely morsels and whatever thing the sith of time mows down devour unspared till i in man residing through the raze his thoughts his looks words actions all infect and season him thy last and sweetest prey this said they both betook them several ways both to destroy or unimmortal make all kinds and for destruction to mature sooner or later which the almighty seeing from his transcendent seat the saints among to those bright order uttered thus his voice see with what heat these dogs of hell advance to waste and havoc yonder world which i so fair and good created and had still kept in that state had not the folly of man let in these wasteful furies who impute folly to me so does the prince of hell and his adherents that with so much ease i suffer them to enter and possess a place so heavenly and conniving seem to gratify my scornful enemy that laugh as if transported with some fit of passion i to them had quit all at random yielded up to their misrule and know not that i called and drew them thither my hellhounds to lick up the draff and filth which men polluting since with taint hath shed on what was pure till crammed and gorged nigh burst with sucked and glutted offal at one sling of thy victorious arm wellpleasing son both since and death and yawning grave at last through chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of hell for ever and seal up his ravenous jaws then heaven and earth renewed shall be made pure to sanctity that shall receive no stain till then the curse pronounced on both precedes he ended and the heavenly audience loud sung halleluia as the found of seas through multitude that sung just are thy ways righteous are thy decrees on all thy works who can extenuate thee next to the son destined restorer of mankind by whom new heaven and earth shall to the ages rise or down from heaven descend such was their song while the creator calling forth by name his mighty angels gave them several charge as sorted best with present things the sun had first his precept so to move so shine as might affect the earth with cold and heat scarce tolerable and from the north to call decrepit winter from the south to bring solstitial summer's heat to the blanc moon her office they prescribed to the other five their planetary motions and aspects in sextile square and trine and opposite of noxious efficacy and when to join in synod unbenign and taught the fixed their influence malignant when to shower which of them rising with the sun or falling should prove tempestuous to the winds they set their corners when with bluster to confound sea air and shore the thunder when to roll with terror through the dark aereal hall some say he bid his angels turn ascanse the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more from the suns axle they with labour pushed oblique the centric globe some say the sun was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road like distant breadth to taurus with the seav'n atlantic sisters and the spartan twins up to the tropic crab thence down amain by leo and the virgin and the scales a deep as capricorne to bring in change of seasons to each climb else had the spring perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flours equal in days and nights except to those beyond the polar circles to them day had unbenighted shon while the low sun to recompense his distance in their sighed had rounded still the horizon and not known or east or west ▪ which had forbid the snow from cold estotiland and south as far beneath magellan at that tasted fruit the sun as from thyestean banquet turned his course intended else how had the world inhabited though sinless more then now avoided pinching cold and scorching heat these changes in the heavens though slow produced like change on sea and land sidereal blast vapour and missed and exhalation hight corrupt and pestilent now from the north of normbega and the samoed shore bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice and snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw boreas and caecias and argestes loud and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn with adverse blast up-turns them from the south notus and afer black with thunderous clouds from serraliona thwart of these as fierce forth rush the levant and the ponent winds eurus and zephir with their lateral noise sirocco and libecchio thus began outrage from liveless things but discord first daughter of since among the irrational death introduced through fierce antipathy beast now with bead gan war and foul with foul and fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving devoured each other nor stood much in awe of man but fled him or with countenance grim glared on him passing these were from without the growing misery's which adam saw already in part though hid in gloomiest shade to sorrow abandoned but worse felt within and in a troubled sea of passion tossed thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint o miserable of happy is this the end of this new glorious world and me so late the glory of that glory who now become accursed of blessed hide me from the face of god whom to behold was then my highth of happiness yet well if here would end the misery i deserved it and would bear my own deservings but this will nor serve all that i eat or drink or shall beget is propagated curse o voice once herd delightfully increase and multiply now death to hear for what can i increase or multiply but curses on my head who of all ages to succeed but feeling the evil on him brought by me will curse my head ill fare our ancestor impure for this we may thank adam but his thanks shall be the execration so beside mine own that bide upon me all from me shall with a fierce reflux on me redound on me as on their natural centre light heavy though in their place o fleeting joys of paradise deer bought with lasting woes did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me or here place in this delicious garden as my will concurd not to my being it were but right and equal to reduce me to my dust desirous to resign and render back all i received unable to perform thy terms too hard by which i was to hold the good i sought not to the loss of that sufficient penalty why hast thou added the sense of endless woes inexplicable thy justice seems yet to say truth too late i thus contest then should have been refused those terms whatever when they were proposed thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good then cavil the conditions and though god made thee without thy leave what if thy son prove disobedient and reproved retort wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee that proud excuse yet him not thy election but natural necessity begotten god made thee of choice his own and of his own to serve him thy reward was of his grace thy punishment then justly is at his will be it so for i submit his doom is fair that dust i am and shall to dust return oh welcome hour whenever why delays his hand to execute what his decree fixed on this day why do i overlive why am i mocked with death and length'nd out to deathless pain how gladly would i meet mortality my sentence and be earth ▪ insensible how glad would lay me down as in my mother's lap there i should test and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more would thunder in my ears no fear of worse to me and to my offspring would torment me with cruel expectation yet one doubt pursues me still lest all i cannot die lest that pure breath of life the spirit of man which god inspired cannot together perish with this corporeal clod then in the grave or in some other dismal place who knows but i shall die a living death o thought horrid if true yet why it was but breath of life that sinned what die but what had life and since the body properly hath neither all of me then shall die let this appease the doubt since humane reach no further knows for though the lord of all be infinite is his wrauth also be it man is not so but mortal doomed how can he exercise wrath without end on man whom death must end can he make deathless death that were to make strange contradiction which to god himself impossible is held as argument of weakness not of power will he draw out for anger's sake finite to infinite in punished man to satisfy his rigour satisfied never that were to extend his sentence beyond dust and nature's law by which all causes else according still to the reception of their matter act not to the extent of their own sphere but say that death be not one stroke as i supposed bereaving sense but endless misery from this day onward which i feel begun both in me and without me and so last to perpetuity ay me that fear comes thundering back with dreadful revolution on my defenseless head both death and i am found eternal and incorporate both nor i on my part single in me all posterity stands cursed fair patrimony that i must leave you sons oh were i able to waste it all my self and leave you none so disinherited how would you bless me now your curse ah why should all mankind for one men fault thus guiltless be condemned if guiltless but from me what can proceed but all corrupt both mind and will depraved not to do only but to will the same with me how can they then acquitted stand in sighed of god him after all disputes forced i absolve all my evasions vain and reasonings though through mazes led me still but to my own conviction first and last on me me only as the fourse and spring of all corruption all the blame lights due so might the wrauth found wish couldst thou support that burden heavier then the earth to bear then all the world much heavier though divided with that bad woman thus what thou desirest and what thou fearest alike destroys all hope of refuge and concludes thee miserable beyond all past example and future to satan only like both crime and doom o conscience into what abyss of fears and horrors hast thou driven me out of which i find no way from deep to deeper plunged thus adam to himself lamented loud through the still night not now as ere man fell wholesome and cool and mild but with black air accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom which to his evil conscience represented all things with double terror on the ground outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft cursed his creation death as oft accused of tardy execution since denounced the day of his offence why comes not death said he with one thrice acceptable stroke to end me shall truth fail to keep her word justice divine not hast'n to be just but death comes not at call justice divine mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries o woods oh fountains hillocks dales and bowers with other echo late i taught your shades to answer and resound far other song whom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld desolate where she sat approaching nigh soft words to his fierce passion she assayed but her with stern regard he thus repelled out of my sighed thou serpent that name best befits thee with him leagued thy self as false and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape like his and colour serpentine may show thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee henceforth lest that too heavenly from pretended to hellish falsehood snare them but for thee i had persisted happy had not thy pride and wandering vanity when lest was safe rejected my forewarning and disdained not to be trusted longing to be seen though by the devil himself him overweening to overreach but with the serpent meeting fooled and beguiled by him thou i by thee to trust thee from my side imagined wise constant mature proof against all assaults and understood not all was but a show rather then solid virtue all but a rib crooked by nature bent as now appears more to the part sinister from me drawn well if thrown out as supernumerary to my just number found o why did god creator wise that peopled highest heaven with spirits masculine create at last this novelty on earth this fair defect of nature and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine or find some other way to generate mankind this mischief had not then befallen and more that shall befall innumerable disturbances on earth through female snares and straight conjunction with this sex for either he never shall find out fit mate but such as some misfortune brings him or mistake or whom he wishes mod shall seldom gain through her perverseness but shall see her gained by a far worse or if she love withheld by parents or his happiest choice too late shall meet already linked and wedlock-bound to a fell adversary his hate or shame which infinite calamine shall cause to humane life and household peace confound he added not and from her turned but eve not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing and tresses all disordered at his feet fell humble and embracing them besaught his peace and thus proceeded in her plaint forsake me not thus adam witness heaven what love sincere and reverence in my heart i bear thee and unweeting have offended unhappily deceived thy suppliant i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid thy counsel in this uttermost distress my only strength and stay forlorn of thee whither shall i betake me where subsist while yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps between us two let there be peace both joining as joined in injuries one enmity against a foe by doom express assigned us that cruel serpent on me exercise not thy hatred for this misery befallen on me already lost me then thy self more miserable both have sinned but thou against god only i against god and thee and to the place of judgement will return there with my cries importune heaven that all the sentence from thy head removed may ligh on me sole cause to thee of all this woe me me only just object of his ire she ended weeping and her lowly plighted immoveable till peace obtained from fault acknowledged and deplored in adam wraught commiseration soon his heart relented towards her his life so late and sole delight now at his feet submissive in distress creature so fair his reconcilement seeking his counsel whom she had displeased his aid as one disarmed his anger all he lost and thus with peaceful words upraised her soon unwary and too desirous as before so now of what thou knowest not who desirest the punishment all on thy self alas bear thine own first ill able to sustain his full wrauth whose thou feelest as yet lest part and my displeasure bearest so ill if prayers could altar high decrees i to that place would speed before thee and be louder herd that on my head all might be visited thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven to me committed and by me exposed but rise let us no more contend nor blame each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive in offices of love how we may lighten each others burden in our share of woe since this days death denounced if ought i see will prove no sudden but a slow paced evil a long days dying to augment our pain and to our seed oh hapless seed derived to whom thus eve recovering heart replied adam by sad experiment i know how little weight my words with thee can find found so erroneous thence by just event found so unfortunate nevertheless restored by thee vile as i am to place of new acceptance hopeful to regain thy love the sole contentment of my heart living or dying from thee i will not hide what thoughts in my unquiet breast are ris'n tending to some relief of our extremes or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable as in our evils and of easier choice if care of our descent perplex us most which must be born to certain woe devoured by death at last and miserable it is to be to others cause of misery our own begotten and of our loins to bring into this cursed world a woeful raze that after wretched life must be at last food for so foul a monster in thy power it lies yet ere conception to prevent the raze unblest to being yet unbegotten childless thou art childless remain so death shall be deceived his glut and with us two be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw but if thou judge it hard and difficult conversing looking loving to abstain from loves due rites nuptial embraces sweet and with desire to languish

for both let us make short let us seek death or he not found supply with our own hands his office on our selves why stand we longer shivering under fears that show no end but death and have the power of many ways to die the shortest choosing destruction with destruction to destroy she ended her or vehement despair broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts had entertained as died her checks with pale but adam with such counsel nothing swayed to better hope's his more attentive mind labouring had raised and thus to eve replied eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems to argue in thee something more sublime and excellent then what thy mind contemnes but self-destruction therefore sought refutes that excellence thought in thee and implies not thy contempt but anguish and regret for loss of life and pleasure overlove or if thou covet death as utmost end of misery so thinking to evade the penalty pronounced doubt not but god hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire then so to be forestalled much more i fear least death so snatched will not exempt us from the pain we are by doom to pay rather such acts of contumacy will provoke the highest to make death in us live then let us seek some safer resolution which methinks i have in view calling to mind with heed part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise the serpents head piteous amends unless be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe satan who in the serpent hath contrived against us this deceit to crush his head would be revenge indeed which will be lost by death brought on our selves or childless days resolved as thou proposest so our foe shall escape his punishment ordained and we instead shall double ours upon our heads no more be mentioned then of violence against our selves and wilful barrenness that cuts us off from hope and savours only rancour and pride impatience and despite reluctance against god and his just yoke laid on our necks remember with what mild and gracious temper he both herd and judged without wrauth or reviling we expected immediate dissolution which we thought was meant by death that day when lo to thee pains only in childbearing were foretold and bringing forth soon recompensed with joy fruit of thy womb on me the curse aslope glanced on the ground with labour i must earn my bred what harm idleness had been worse my labour will sustain me and least cold or heat

pipe the pastoral reed of hermes or his opiate rod mean while to resalute the world with sacred light leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmd the earth when adam and first matron eve had ended now their orisons and found strength added from above new hope to spring out of despair joy but with fear yet linked which thus to eve his welcome words renewed eve easily may faith admit that all the good which we enjoy from heaven descends but that from us ought should ascend to heaven so prevalent as to concern the mind of god high-blest or to incline his will hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer or one short sighs of humane breath up-borne even to the seat of god for since i sought by prayer the offended deity to appease kneeled and before him humbled all my heart methought i saw him placable and mild bending his ear persuasion in me grew that i was herd with favour peace returned home to my breast and to my memory his promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe which then not minded in dismay yet now assures me that the bitterness of death is past and we shall live whence hail to thee eve rightly called mother of all mankind mother of all things living since by thee man is to live and all things live for man. to whom thus eve with sad demeanour meek ill worthy i such title should belong to me transgressor who for thee ordained a help became thy snare to me reproach rather belongs distrust and all dispraise but infinite in pardon was my judge that i who first brought death on all am graced the source of life next favourable thou who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st far other name deserving but the field to labour calls us now with sweat imposed though after sleepless night for see the morn all unconcerned with our unrest begins her rosy progress smiling let us forth i never from thy side henceforth to stray wherere our days work lies though now enjoined laborious till day droop while here we dwell what can be toilsome in these pleasant walks here let us live though in fallen state content so spoke so wished much-humbld eve but fate subscribed not nature first gave signs impressed on bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed after short blush of morn nigh in her sighed the bird of jove stooped from his aerie tour two birds of gayest plume before him drove down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods first hunter then pursued a gentle brace goodliest of all the forest heart and hind direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight adam observed and with his eye the chase pursuing not unmoved to eve thus spoke o eve some further change awaits us nigh which heaven by these mute signs in nature shows forerunners of his purpose or to warn us haply too secure of our discharge from penalty because from death released some days how long and what till then our life who knows or more then this that we are dust and thither must return and be no more why else this double object in our sighed of flight pursued in the air and over the ground one way the selfsame hour why in the east darkness ere days mid course and morning light more orient in yond western cloud that draws over the blue firmament a radiant white and slow descends with something heavenly fraught he erred not for by this the heavenly bans down from a sky of jasper lighted now in paradise and on a hill made alt a glorious apparition had not doubt and carnal fear that day dimmed adams eye not that more glorious when the angels met jacob in mahanaim where he saw the field pavilioned with his guardians bright nor that which on the flaming mount appeared in dothan covered with a camp of fire against the syrian king who to surprise one man assassin-like had levied war war unproclamed the princely hierarch in their bright stand there left his powers to seize possession of the garden he alone to find where adam shelterd took his way not unperceived of adam who to eve while the great visitant approachd thus spoke eve now expect great tidings which perhaps of us will soon determine or impose new laws to be observed for i descry from yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill one of the heavenly host and by his gate none of the meanest some great potentate or of the thrones above such majesty invests him coming yet not terrible that i should fear nor sociably mild as raphael that i should much confide but solemn and sublime whom not to offend with reverence i must meet and thou retire he ended and the arch-angel soon drew nigh not in his shape celestial but as man clad to meet man over his lucid arms a military vest of purple flowed livelier then meliboean or the grain of sarra worn by kings and hero's old in time of truce iris had dipped the wooff his starry helm unbuckled showed him prime in manhood where youth ended by his side as in a glistering zodiac hung the sword satans dire dread and in his hand the spear adam bowed low he kingly from his state inclined not but his coming thus declared adam heavens high behest no preface needs sufficient that thy prayers are herd and death then due by sentence when thou didst transgress defeated of his seizure many days given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent and one bad act with many deeds well done mayest cover well may then thy lord appeased redeem thee quite from death's rapacious claim but longer in this paradise to dwell permits not to remove thee i am come and send thee from the garden forth to till the ground whence thou wast take fitter soil he added not for adam at the news heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood that all his senses bound eve who unseen yet all had herd with audible lament discovered soon the place of her retire o unexpected stroke worse then of death must i thus leave thee paradise thus leave thee native soil these happy walks and shades fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend quiet though sad the respite of that day that must be mortal to us both o flours that never will in other climate grow my early visitation and my last at even which i bred up with tender hand from the first opening bud and gave you names who now shall rear you to the sun or rank your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned with what to sighed or smell was sweet from thee how shall i part and whither wander down into a lower world to this obscure and wild how shall we breath in other air less pure accustomd to immortal fruits whom thus the angel interrupted mild lament not eve but patiently resign what justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart thus overfond on that which is not thine thy going is not lonely with thee goes thy husband him to follow thou art bound where he abides think there thy native soil adam by this from the cold sudden damp recovering and his scattered spirits returned to michael thus his humble words addressed celestial whither among the thrones or named of them the highest for such of shape may seem prince above princes gently hast thou told thy message which might else in telling wound and in performing end us what beside of sorrow and dejection and despair our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring departure from this happy place our sweet recess and only consolation left familiar to our eyes all places else inhospitable appear and desolate nor knowing us nor known and if by prayer incessant i could hope to change the will of him who all things can i would not cease to weary him with my assiduous cries but prayer against his absolute decree no more avails then breath against the wind blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth therefore to his great bidding i submit this most afflicts me that departing hence as from his face i shall be hid deprived his blessed countenance here i could frequent with worship place by place where he voutsaf ' d presence divine and to my sons relate on this mount he appeared under this tree stood visible among these pines his voice i herd here with him at this fountain talked so many grateful altars i would rear of grassy terfe and pile up every stone of lustre from the brook in memory or monument to ages and thereon offer sweet smelling gums and fruits and flours in yonder neither world where shall i seek his bright appearances or foot step-trace for though i fled him angry yet recalled to life prolongd and promised raze i now gladly behold though but his utmost skirts of glory and far off his steps adore to whom thus michael with regard benign adam thou knowest heaven his and all the earth not this rock only his omnipresence fills land sea and air and every kind that lives fomented by his virtual power and warmed all the earth he gave thee to possess and rule no despicable gift surmise not then his presence to these narrow bounds confined of paradise or eden this had been perhaps thy capital seare from whence had spread all generations and had hither come from all the ends of the earth to celebrate and reverence thee their great progenitor but this preeminence thou hast lost brought down to dwell on even ground now with thy sons yet doubt not but in valley and in plain god is as here and will be found alike present and of his presence many a sign still following thee still compassing thee round with goodness and paternal love his face express and of his steps the track divine which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed ere thou from hence depart know i am sent to show thee what shall come in future days to thee and to thy offspring good with bad expect to hear supernal grace contending with sinfulness of men thereby to learn true patience and to temper joy with fear and pious sorrow equally enured by moderation either state to bear prosperous or adverse so shalt thou led safest thy life and best prepared endure thy mortal passage when it comes ascend this hill let eve for i have drenched her eyes here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest as once thou sleptest while she to life was formed to whom thus adam gratefully replied ascend i follow thee safe guide the path thou leadest me and to the hand of heaven submit however chastening to the evil turn my obvious breast arming to overcome by suffering and earn rest from labour wone if so i may attain so both ascend in the visions of god it was a hill of paradise the highest from whose top the hemisphere of earth in clearest ken stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay not higher that hill nor wider looking round whereon for different cause the tempter set our second adam in the wilderness to show him all earth's kingdoms and their glory his eye might there command wherever stood city of old or modern fame the seat of mightiest empire from the destined walls of cambalu seat of cathaian can and samarchand by oxus temirs throne to paquin of sinaean kings and thence to agra and lahor of great mogul down to the golden chersonese or where the persian in ecbatan sat or since in hispahan or where the russian kfar in mosco or the sultan in bizance turchestan-born nor could his eye not ken the empire of negus to his utmost port ercoco and the less maritime kings mombaza and quiloa and melind and sofala thought ophir to the realm of congo and angola farthest south or thence from niger flood to atlas mount the kingdoms of almansor fez and sus marocco and algiers and tremisen on europe thence and where rome was to sway the world in spirit perhaps he also saw rich mexico the seat of motezume and cusco in peru the richer seat of atabalipa and yet unspoiled guiana whose great city geryons sons call el dorado but to nobler sights michael from adams eyes the film removed which that false fruit that promised clearer sighed had bred then purged with euphrasie and rue the visual nerve for he had much to see and from the well of life three drops instilled so deep the power of these ingredients pierced eevn to the inmost seat of mental sighed that adam now enforced to close his eyes sunk down and all his spirits became entranced but him the gentle angel by the hand soon raised and his attention thus recalled adam now open thine eyes and first behold the effects which thy original crime hath wrought in some to spring from thee who never touched the excepted tree nor with the snake conspired nor sinned thy since yet from that derive corruption to bring forth more violent deeds his eyes he op'nd and beheld a field part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves new reaped the other part sheep-walks and folds ith' midst and altar as the landmark stood rustic of grassy sord thither anon a sweaty reaper from his tillage brought first fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf unculled as came to hand a shepherd next more meek came with the firstlings of his flock choicest and best then sacrificing laid the inward and their fat with incense strewed on the cleft wood and all due rites performed his offering soon propitious fire from heaven consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam the others not for his was not sincere whereat he inly raged and as they talked smote him into the midriff with a stone that beatrice out life he fell and deadly pale groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused much at that sighed was adam in his heart dismayed and thus in haste to the angel cried o teacher some great mischief hath befallen to that meek man who well had sacrificed is piety thus and pure devotion paid to whom michael thus he also moved replied these two are brothers adam and to come out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slave for envy that his brother's offering found from heaven acceptance but the bloody fact will be avenged and the others faith approved lose no reward though here thou see him die rolling in dust and gore to which our sire alas both for the deed and for the cause but have i now seen death is this the way i must return to native dust o sighed of terror foul and ugly to behold horrid to think how horrible to feel to whom thus michael death thou hast seen in his first shape on man but many shapes of death and many are the ways that led to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense more terrible at the entrance then within some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die by fire flood famine by intemperance more in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring diseases dire of which a monstrous crew before thee shall appear that thou mayest know what misery the inabstinence of eve shall bring on men immediately a place before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark a lazar-house it seemed wherein were laid numbers of all diseased all maladies of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms of heartsick agonic all fevorous kinds convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs intestine stone and ulcer colic pangs daemoniac frenzy moping melancholy and moonstruck madness pining atrophy marasmus and wide-wasting pestilence dropsies and asthma's and joint-racking rheums dire was the tossing deep the groans despair tended the sick busiest from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked with vows as their chief good and final hope sighed so deform what heart of rock could long drie-eyed behold adam could not but wept though not of woman born compassion quelled his best of man and gave him up to tears a space till firmer thoughts restrained excess and scarce recovering words his plaint renewed oh miserable mankind to what fallen degraded to what wretched state reserved better end her unborn why is life given to be thus wrested from us rather why obtruded on us thus who if we knew what we receive would either not accept life offered or soon beg to lay it down glad to be so dismissed in peace can thus the image of god in man created once so goodly and erect though faulty since to such unsightly sufferings be debased under inhuman pains why should not man retaining still divine similitude in part from such deformities be free and for his makers image sake exempt their makers image answered michael then forsook them when themselves they vilified to serve ungoverned appetite and took his image whom they served a brutish vice inductive mainly to the since of eve therefore so abject is their punishment disfiguring not gods likeness but their own or if his likeness by themselves defaced while they pervert pure nature's healthful rules to loathsome sickness worthily since they gods image did not reverence in themselves i yield it just said adam and submit but is there yet no other way beside these painful passages how we may come to death and mix with our connatural dust there is said michael if thou well observe the rule of not too much by temperance taught in what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence due nourishment not gluttonous delight till many years over thy head return so mayest thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop into thy mother's lap or be with ease gathered not harshly plucked for death mature this is old age but then thou must outlive thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change to withered weak and grey thy senses then obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgo to what thou hast and for the air of youth hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reign a melancholy damp of cold and dry to weigh thy spirits down and last consume the balm of life to whom our ancestor henceforth i fly not death nor would prolong life much bent rather how i may be quit fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge which i must keep till my appointed day of rendering up and patiently attend my dissolution michael replied nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst live well how long or short permit to heaven and now prepare thee for another sighed he looked and favu a spacious plain whereon were tents of various hue by some were herds of cattle grazing others whence the found of instruments that made melodious chime was herd of harp and organ and who moved their stops and chords was seen his volant touch instinct through all proportions low and high fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue in other part stood one who at the forge labouring two massy clods of iron and brass had melted whither found where casual fire had wasted woods on mountain or in vale down to the veins of earth thence gliding hight to some caves mouth or whither washed by stream from underground the liquid over he drained into fit moulds prepared from which he formed first his own tools then what might else be wrought fusil or graven in mettle after these but on the hither side a different sort from the high neighbouring hills which was their seat down to the plain descended by their guise just men they seemed and all their study bent to worship god aright and know his works not hid nor those things last which might preserve freedom and peace to men they on the plain long had not walked when from the tents behold a beavie of fair women richly gay in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung soft amorous ditties and in dance came on the men though grave eyed them and let their eyes rove without rein till in the amorous net fast caught they liked and each his liking chosen and now of love they treat till the eevning star loves harbinger appeared then all in heat they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke hymen then first to marriage rites invoked with feast and music all the tents resound such happy interview and fair event of love and youth not lost songs garlands flours and charming symphonies attached the heart of adam soon inclined to admit delight the bent of nature which he thus expressed true opener of mine eyes prime angel blessed much better seems this vision and more hope of peaceful days portends then those two past those were of hate and death or pain much worse here nature seems fulfilled in all her ends to whom thus michael judge not what is best by pleasure though to nature seeming meet created as thou art to nobler end holy and pure conformity divine those tents thou sawest so pleasant were the tents of wickedness wherein shall dwell his raze who slew his brother studious they appear of arts that polish life inventers rare unmindful of their maker though his spirit taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none yet they abeauteous offspring shall beget for that fair female troop thou sawest that seemed of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay yet empty of all good wherein consists woman's domestic honour and chief praise bred only and completed to the taste of lustful appetence to sing to dance to dress and troule the tongue and roll the eye to these that sober raze of men whose lives religious titled them the sons of god shall yield up all their virtue all their fame ignobly to the trains and to the smiles of these fair atheists and now swim in joy erelong to swim at large and laugh for which the world erelong a world of tears must weep to whom thus adam of short joy bereft o pity and shame that they who to live well entered so fair should turn aside to tread paths indirect or in the mid way faint but still i see the tenor of men woe holds on the same from woman to begin from men effeminate slackness it begins said the angel who should better hold his place by wisdom and superior gifts received but now prepare thee for another scene he looked and saw wide territory spread before him towns and rural works between cities of men with lofty gates and towers concours in arms fierce faces threatening war giants of mighty bone and bold emprise part wield their arms part courb the foaming steed single or in array of battle ranged both horse and foot nor idly mustering stood one way a band select from forage drives a heard of beeves fair oxen and fair kine from a sat meadow ground or fleecy flock ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain their booty scarce with life the shepherd's fly but callin aid which makes a bloody fray with cruel tournament the squadrons join where cattle pastured late now scattered lies with carcases and arms the ensanguined field deserted others to a city strong lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine assaulting others from the wall defend with dart and jav'lin stones and sulfurous fire on each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds in other part the sceptered haralds call to council in the city gates anon grey-headed men and grave with warriors mixed assemble and harangues are herd but soon in factious opposition till at last of middle age one rising eminent in wise deport spoke much of right and wrong of justice of religion truth and peace and judgement from above him old and young exploded and had seized with violent hands had not a cloud descending snatched him thence unseen amid the throng so violence proceeded and oppression and sword-law through all the plain and refuge none was found adam was all in tears and to his guide lamenting turned full sad oh what are these death's ministers not men who thus deal death inhumanly to men and multiply ten thousand fouled thee since of him who slew his brother for of whom such massacher make they but of their brothers men of men but who was that just man whom had not heaven rescued had in his righteousness been lost to whom thus michael these are the product of those ill mated marriages thou sawest where good with bad were matched who of themselves abhor to join and by imprudence mixed produce prodigious births of body or mind such were these giants men of high renown for in those days might only shall be admired and valour and heroic virtue called to overcome in battle and subdue nations and bring home spoils with infinite manslaughter shall be held the highest pitch of human glory and for glory done of triumph to be styled great conquerors patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth and what most merits fame in silence hid but he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst the only righteous in a world perverse and therefore hared therefore so beset with foes for daring single to be just and utter odious truth that god would come to judge them with his saints him the most high rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds did as thou sawest receive to walk with god high in salvation and the climes of bliss exempt from death to show thee what reward awaits the good the rest what punishment which now direct thine eyes and soon behold he looked and saw the face of things quite changed the brazen throat of warr had ceased to roar all now was turned to jollity and game to luxury and riot feast and dance marrying or prostituting as befell rape or adultery where passing fair allurd them thence from cups to civil broils at length a reverend sire among them came and of their doings great dislike declared and testified against their ways he oft frequented their assemblies where so met triumphs or festivals and to them preachd conversion and repentance as to souls in prison under judgements imminent but all in vain which when he saw he ceased contending and removed his tents far off then from the mountain hewing timber tall began to built a vessel of huge bulk measured by cubit length and breadth and highth smeard round with pitch and in the side a door contrived and of provisions laid in large for man and beast when lo a wonder strange i of every beast and bird and insect small came seavens and pairs and entered in as taught their order last the sire and his three sons with their four wives and god made fast the door meanwhile the southwind rose and with black wings wide hovering all the clouds together drove from under heaven the hills to their supply vapour and exhalation dusk and moist sent up amain and now the thick'nd sky like a dark ceiling stood down rushed the rain impetuous and continued till the earth no more was seen the floating vessel swum uplifted and secure with beaked prow road tilting over the waves all dwellings else flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp deep under water rolled sea covered sea sea without shore and in their palaces where luxury late reigned sea-monsters whelped and stabled of mankind so numerous late all left in one small bottom swum embarked how didst thou grieve then adam to behold the end of all thy offspring end so sad depopulation thee another flood of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared by the angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last though comfortless as when a father mourns his children all in view destroyed at once and scarce to the angel utterdst thus thy plaint o visions ill foreseen better had i lived ignorant of future so had born my part of evil only each days lot enough to bear those now that were dispensed the burden of many ages on me light at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth abortive to torment me ere their being with thought that they must be let no man seek henceforth to be foretold what shall befall him or his children evil he may be sure which neither his foreknowing can prevent and he the future evil shall no less in apprehension then in substance feel grievous to bear but that care now is past man is not whom to warn those few escaped famine and anguish will at last consume wandering that watery desert i had hope when violence was ceased and war on earth all would have then gone well peace would have crowned with length of happy days the raze of man but i was far deceived for now i see peace to corrupt no less then war to waste how comes it thus unfold celestial guide and whither here the raze of man will end to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawest in triumph and luxurious wealth are they first seen in acts of prowess eminent and great exploits but of true virtue void who having spilled much blood and done much waste subduing nations and achieved thereby fame in the world high titles and rich prey shall change their course to pleasure ease and sloth surfeit and lust till wantonness and pride raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace the conquered also and enslaved by war shall with their freedom lost all virtue lose and fear of god from whom their piety feigned in sharp contest of battle found no aid against invaders therefore cold in zeal thenceforth shall practice how to live secure worldly or dissolute on what their lords shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear more then enough that temperance may be tried so all shall turn degenerate all depraved justice and temperance truth and faith forgotten one man except the only son of light in a dark age against example good against allurement custom and a world offended fearless of reproach and scorn or violence he of their wicked ways shall them admonish and before them set the paths of righteousness how much more safe and full of peace denouncing wrauth to come on their impenitence and shall return of them derided but of god observed the one just man alive by his command shall built a wondrous ark as thou beheldst to save himself and household from amid a world devote to universal rack no sooner he with them of man and beast select for life shall in the ark be lodged and shelterd round but all the cataracts of heaven set open on the earth shall pour rain day and night all fountains of the deep broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp beyond all bounds till inundation rise above the highest hills then shall this mount of paradise by might of waves be moved out of his place pushd by the horned flood with all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift down the great river to the opening gulf and there take root and island salt and bore the haunt of seals and orcs and sea-mews clang to teach thee that god attributes to place no sanctity if none be thither brought by men who there frequent or therein dwell and now what further shall ensue behold he looked and saw the ark hull on the flood which now abated for the clouds were fled drivn by a keen northwind that blowing dry wrinkled the face of deluge as decayed and the deer sun on his wide watery glass gazed hight and of the fresh wave largely drew as after thirst which made their flowing shrink from standing lake to tripping ebb that stole with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopped his sluices as the heaven his windows shut the ark no more now floats but seems on ground fast on the top of some high mountain fixed and now the tops of hills as rocks appear with clamor thence the rapid currents drive towards the retreating sea their furious tied forthwith from out the ark a raven flies and after him the furer messenger a dove sent forth once and again to spy green tree or ground whereon his foot may light the second time returning in his bill and olive leaf he brings pacific sign anon dry ground appears and from his ark the ancient sire descends with all his train then with uplifted hands and eyes devout grateful to heaven over his head beholds a dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow conspicuous with three listed colours gay betokening peace from god and covenant new whereat the heart of adam erst so sad greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth o thou who future things canst represent as present heavenly instructer i revive at this last sighed assured that man shall live with all the creatures and their seed preserve farr less i now lament for one whole world of wicked sons destroyed then i rejoice for one man found so perfect and so just that god vouchsafes to raise another world from him and all his anger to forget but say what mean those coloured streaks in heaven distended as the brow of god appeased or serve they as a floury verge to bind the fluid skirts of that same watery cloud lest it again dissolve and shower the earth to whom the archangel dextrously thou aimest so willingly does god remit his ire though late repenting him of mandepraved grieved at his heart when looking down he saw the whole earth filled with violence and all flesh corrupting each their way yet those removed such grace shall one just man find in his sighed that he relents nor to blot out mankind and makes a covenant never to destroy the earth again by flood nor let the sea surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world with man therein or beast but when he brings over the earth a cloud will therein set his triple-coloured bow whereon to look and call to mind his covenant day and night seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost shall hold their course till fire purge all things new both heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell the end of the eleventh book paradise lost. book xii the argument the angel michael continues from the flood to relate what shall succeed then in the mention of abraham comes by degrees to explain who that seed of the woman shall be which was promised adam and eve in the fallen his incarnation death resurrection and ascension the state of the church till his second coming adam greatly satisfied and recomforted by these relations and promises descends the hill with michael wakens eve who all this while had slept but with gentle dreams composed to quietness of mind and submission michael in either hand leads them out of paradise the fiery sword waving behind them and the cherubin taking their stations to guard the place as one who in his journey bates at noon though bent on speed so her the archangel paused betwixt the world destroyed and world restored if adam aught perhaps might interpose then with transition sweet new speech resumes thus thou hast seen one world begin and end and man as from a second stock proceed much thou hast yet to see but i perceive thy mortal sighed to fail objects divine must needs impair and weary human sense henceforth what is to come i will relate thou therefore give due audience and attend this second source of men while yet but few and while the dread of judgement past remains fresh in their minds fearing the deity with some regard to what is just and right shall led their lives and multiply apace labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop corn wine and oil and from the heard or flock oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid with large wine-offerings poured and sacred feast shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell long time in peace by families and tribes under paternal rule till one shall rise of proud ambitious heart who nor content with fair equality fraternal state will arrogate dominion undeserved over his brothers and quite dispossess concord and law of nature from the earth hunting and men not beasts shall be his game with war and hostile snare such as refuse subjection to his empire tyrannous a mighty hunter thence he shall be styled before the lord as in despite of heaven or from heaven claiming second sovereignty and from rebellion shall derive his name though of rebellion others he accuse he with a crew whom like ambition joins with him or under him to tyrannise marching from eden towards the west shall find the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge boils out from under ground the mouth of hell of brick and of that stuff they cast to built a city and tower whose top may reach to heaven and get themselves a name least far dispersed in foreign lands their memory be lost regardless whither good or evil fame but god who oft descends to visit men unseen and through their habitations walks to mark their doings them beholding soon comes down to see their city ere the tower obstruct heaven towers and in derision sets upon their tongues a various spirit to raze quite out their native language and instead to sow a jangling noise of words unknown forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud among the builders each to other calls not understood till hoarse and all in rage as mocked they storm great laughter was in heaven and looking down to see the hubbub strange and hear the din thus was the building left ridiculous and the work confusion named whereto thus adam fatherly displeased o execrable son so to aspire above his brothers to himself assuming authority usurped from god not given he gave us only over beast fish fowl dominion absolute that right we hold by his donation but man over men he made not lord such title to himself reserving human left from human free but this usurper his encroachment proud stays nor on man to god his tower intends siege and defiance wretched man what food will he convey up thither to sustain himself and his rash army where thin air above the clouds will pine his entrails gross and famish him of breath if not of bred to whom thus michael justly thou abhorrest that son who on the quiet state of men such trouble brought affecting to subdue rational liberty yet know withal since thy original lapse true liberty is lost which always with right reason dwells twinned and from her hath no dividual being reason in man obscured or not obeyed immediately inordinate desires and upstart passion catch the government from reason and to servitude reduce man till then free therefore since he permits within himself unworthy powers to reign over free reason god in judgement just subjects him from without to violent lords who oft as undeservedly enthral his outward freedom tyranny must be though to the tyrant thereby no excuse yet sometimes nations will decline so low from virtue which is reason that no wrong but justice and some fatal curse annexed deprives them of their outward liberty their inward lost witness the irreverent son of him who built the ark who for the shame done to his father herd this heavy curse servant of servants on his vicious raze thus will this latter as the former world still tend from bad to worse till god at last wearied with their iniquities withdraw his presence from among them and avert his holy eyes resolving from thenceforth to leave them to their own polluted ways and one peculiar nation to select from all the rest of whom to be invoked a nation from one faithful man to spring him on this side euphrates yet residing bred up in idol-worship oh that men canst thou believe should be so stupid grown while yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood as to forsake the living god and fallen to worship their own work in wood and stone for gods yet him god the most high vouchsafes to call by vision from his father's house his kindred and false gods into a land which he will show him and from him will raise a mighty nation and upon him shower his benediction so that in his seed all nations shall be blessed he straight obeys not knowing to what land yet firm believes i see him but thou canst not with what faith he leaves his gods his friends and native soil ʋr of chaldaea passing now the ford to haran after him a cumbrous train of herds and flocks and numerous servitude not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth with god who called him in a land unknown canaan he now attains i see his tents pitched about sechem and the neighbouring plain of moreh there by promise he receives gift to his progeny of all that land from hamath northward to the desert south things by their names i call though yet unnamed from hermon east to the great western sea mount hermon yonder sea each place behold in prospect as i point them on the shore mount carmel here the double-founted stream jordan true limit eastward but his sons shall dwell to senir that long ridge of hills this ponder that all nations of the earth shall in his seed be blessed by that seed is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise the serpents head whereof to thee anon plainlier shall be revealed this patriarch blessed whom faithful abraham due time shall call a son and of his son a grandchild leaves like him in faith in wisdom and renown the grand child with twelve sons increased departs from canaan to a land hereafter called egypt divided by the river nile see where it flows disgorging at seaven mouths into the sea to sojourn in that land he comes invited by a younger son in time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds raise him to be the second in that realm of pharao there he die and leaves his raze growing into a nation and now grown suspected to a sequent king who seeks to stop their overgrowth as inmate guests too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves inhospitably and kills their infant males till by two brothers those two brothers call moses and aaron sent from god to claim his people from enthralment they return with glory and spoil back to their promised land. but first the lawless tyrant who denies to know their god or message to regard must be compelled by signs and judgements dire to blood unshed the rivers must be turned frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill with loathed intrusion and fill all the land his cattle must of rot and murren die botches and blains must all his flesh imboss and all his people thunder mixed with hail hail mixed with fire must rend the egyptian sky and wheel on the earth devouring where it rouls what it devours not herb or fruit or grain a darksome cloud of locusts swarming down must eat and on the ground leave nothing green darkness must overshadow all his bounds palpable darkness and blot out three days last with one midnight stroke all the firstborn of egypt must lie dead thus with ten wounds the river-dragon tamed at length submits to let his sojourners depart and oft humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice more hard'nd after thaw till in his rage pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea swallows him with his host but them lets pass as on dry land between two crystal walls awed by the rod of moses so to stand divided till his rescued gain their shore such wondrous power god to his saint will lend though present in his angel who shall go before them in a cloud and pillar of fire by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire to guide them in their journey and remove behind them while the obdurat king pursues all night he will pursue but his approach darkness defends between till morning watch then through the firey pillar and the cloud god looking forth will trouble all his host and craze their chariot wheels when by command moses once more his potent rod extends over the sea the sea his rod obeys on their imbattelld ranks the waves return and overwhelm their war the raze elect safe towards canaan from the shore advance through the wild desert not the readiest way lest entering on the canaanite allarmd war terrify them inexpert and fear return them back to egypt choosing rather inglorious life with servitude for life to noble and ignoble is more sweet untrained in arms where rashness leads not on this also shall they gain by their delay in the wide wilderness there they shall found their government and their great senate choose through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained god from the mount of sinai whose grey top shall tremble he descending will himself in thunder lightning and loud trumpets found ordain them laws part such as appertain to civil justice part religious rites of sacrifice informing them by types and shadows of that destined seed to bruise the serpent by what means he shall achieve mankinds deliverance but the voice of god to mortal ear is dreadful they beseech that moses might report to them his will and terror cease he grants what they besaught instructed that to god is no access without mediator whose high office now moses in figure bears to introduce one greater of whose day he shall foretell and all the prophets in their age the times of great messiah shall sing thus laws and rites established such delight hath god in men obedient to his will that he vouchsafes among them to set up his tabernacle the holy one with mortal men to dwell by his prescript a sanctuary is framed of cedar overlaid with gold therein and ark and in the ark his testimony the records of his covenant over these a mercy-seat of gold between the wings of two bright cherubin before him burn seaven lamps as in a zodiac representing the heavenly fires over the tent a cloud shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night save when they journey and at length they come conducted by his angel to the land promised to abraham and his seed the rest were long to tell how many battles fought how many kings destroyed and kingdoms wone or how the sun shall in mid heaven stand still a day entire and nights due course adjourn men voice commanding sun in gibeon stand and thou moon in the vale of aialon till israel overcome so call the third from abraham son of isaac and from him his whole descent who thus shall canaan win here adam interposed o sent from heaven enlightner of my darkness gracious things thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern just abraham and his seed now first i find mine eyes true opening and my heart much eased erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become of me and all mankind but now i see his day in whom all nations shall be blessed favour unmerited by me who sought forbidden knowledge by forbidden means this yet i apprehend not why to those among whom god will deign to dwell on earth so many and so various laws are given so many laws argue so many sins among them how can god with such reside to whom thus michael doubt not but that since will reign among them as of thee begotten and therefore was law given them to evince their natural pravity by stirring up since against law to fight that when they see law can discover since but not remove save by those shadowy expiations weak the blood of bulls and goats they may conclude some blood more precious must be paid for man just for unjust that in such righteousness to them by faith imputed they may find justification towards god and peace of conscience which the law by ceremonies cannot appease nor man the moral part perform and not performing cannot live so law appears imperfet and but given with purpose to resign them in full time up to a better covenant disciplined from shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit from imposition of strict laws to free acceptance of large grace from servile fear to filial works of law to works of faith and therefore shall not moses though of god highly beloved being but the minister of law his people into canaan led but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call his name and office bearing who shall quell the adversary serpent and bring back through the world's wilderness long wanderd man safe to eternal paradise of rest meanwhile they in their earthly canaan placed long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins national interrupt their public peace provoking god to raise them enemies from whom as oft he saves them penitent by judges first then under kings of whom the second both for piety renowned and puissant deeds a promise shall receive irrevocable that his regal throne for ever shall endure the like shall sing all prophecy that of the royal stock of david so i name this king shall rise a son the woman's seed to thee foretold foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust all nations and to kings foretold of kings the last for of his reign shall be no end but first a long succession must ensue and his next son for wealth and wisdom famed the clouded ark of god till then in tents wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine such follow him as shall be registerd part good part bad of bad the longer scroll whose foul idolatries and other faults heaped to the popular sum will so incense god as to leave them and expose their land their city his temple and his holy ark with all his sacred things a scorn and prey to that proud city whose high walls thou sawest left in confusion babylon thence called there in captivity he lets them dwell the space of seventie years then brings them back remembering mercy and his covenant sworn to david established as the days of heaven returned from babylon by leave of kings their lords whom god disposed the house of god they first re-edify and for a while in mean estate live moderate till grown in wealth and multitude factious they grow but first among the priests dissension springs men who attend the altar and should most endeavour peace their strife pollution brings upon the temple it self at last they seize the sceptre and regard not davids sons then lose it to a stranger that the true anointed king messiah might be born barred of his right yet at his birth a star unseen before in heaven proclaims him come and guides the eastern sages who inquire his place to offer incense myrrh and gold his place of birth a solemn angel tells to simple shepherd's keeping watch by night they gladly thither haste and by a choir of squadrond angels hear his carol sung a virgin is his mother but his sire the power of the most high he shall ascend the throne hereditary and bound his reign with earth's wide bounds his glory with the heavens he ceased discerning adam with such joy surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears without the vent of words which these he breathed o prophet of glad tidings finisher of utmost hope now clear i understand what oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain why our great expectation should be called the seed of woman virgin mother hail high in the love of heaven yet from my loins thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son of god most high so god with man unites needs must the serpent now his capital bruise expect with mortal pain say where and when their fight what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel to whom thus michael dream not of their fight as of a duel or the local wounds of head or heel not therefore joins the son manhood to godhead with more strength to foil thy enemy nor so is overcome satan whose fallen from heaven a deadlier bruise disabled not to give thee thy death's wound which he who comes thy saviour shall recure not by destroying satan but his works in thee and in thy seed nor can this be but by fulfilling that which thou didst want obedience to the law of god imposed on penalty of death and suffering death the penalty to thy transgression due and due to theirs which out of thine will grow so only can high justice rest apaid the law of god exact he shall fulfil both by obedience and by love though love alone fulfil the law thy punishment he shall endure by coming in the flesh to a reproachful life and cursed death proclaiming life to all who shall believe in his redemption and that his obedience imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits to save them not their own though legal works for this he shall live hated be blasphemed seized on by force judged and to death condemned a shameful and accursed nailed to the cross by his own nation slain for bringing life burr to the cross he nails thy enemies the law that is against thee and the sins of all mankind with him there crucified never to hurt them more who rightly trust in this his satisfaction so he die but soon revives death over him no power shall long usurp ere the third dawning light return the stars of morn shall see him rise out of his grave fresh as the dawning light thy ransom paid which man from death redeems his death for man as many as offered life neglect not and the benefit embrace by faith not void of works this godlike act annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have died in since for ever lost from life this act shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength defeating since and death his two main arms and fix far deeper in his head their stings then temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep a gentle wafting to immortal life nor after resurrection shall he stay longer on earth then certain times to appear to his disciples men who in his life still followed him to them shall leave in charge to teach all nations what of him they learned and his salvation them who shall believe baptizing in the profluent stream the sign of washing them from guilt of since to life pure and in mind prepared if so befall for death like that which the redeemer died all nations they shall teach for from that day not only to the sons of abrahams loins salvation shall be preached but to the sons of abrahams faith wherever through the world so in his seed all nations shall be blessed then to the heaven of heavens he shall ascend with victory triumphing through the air over his foes and thine there shall surprise the serpent prince of air and drag in chains through all his realm and there confounded leave then enter into glory and resume his seat at gods right hand exalted high above all names in heaven and thence shall come when this world's dissolution shall be ripe with glory and power to judge both quick and dead to judge the unfaithful dead but to reward his faithful and receive them into bliss whither in heaven or earth for then the earth shall all be paradise far happier place then this of eden and far happier days so spoke the archangel michael then paused as at the world's great perjod and our sire replete with joy and wonder thus replied o goodness infinite goodness immense that all this good of evil shall produce and evil turn to good more wondered then that which by creation first brought forth light out of darkness full of doubt i stand whither i should repent me now of since by me done and occasioned or rejoice much more that much more good thereof shall spring to god more glory more good will to men from god and over wrauth grace shall abound but say if our deliverer up to heaven must reascend what will betide the few his faithful left among the unfaithful heard the enemies of truth who then shall guide his people who defend will they not deal worse with his followers then with him they dealt be sure they will said the angel but from heaven he to his own a comforter will send the promise of the father who shall dwell his spirit within them and the law of faith working through love upon their hearts shall write to guide them in all truth and also arm with spiritual armour able to resist satans assaults and quench his fiery darts what man can do against them not afraid though to the death against such cruelties with inward consolations recompensed and oft supported so as shall amaze their proudest persecuters for the spirit poured first on his apostles whom he sends to evangelise the nations then on all baptized shall them with wondrous gifts endue to speak all tongues and do all miracles as did their lord before them thus they win great numbers of each nation to receive with joy the tidings brought from heaven at length their ministry performed and raze well run their doctrine and their story written left they die but in their room as they forewarn wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves who all the sacred mysteries of heaven to their own vile advantages shall turn of lucre and ambition and the truth with superstitions and traditions taint left only in those written records pure though not but by the spirit understood then shall they seek to avail themselves of names places and titles and with these to join secular power though feigning still to act by spiritual to themselves appropriating the spirit of god promised alike and given to all believers and from that pretense spiritual laws by carnal power shall force on every conscience laws which none shall find left them inrould or what the spirit within shall on the heart engrave what will they then but force the spirit of grace it self and bind his consort liberty what but unbuild his living temples built by faith to stand their own faith not another's for on earth who against faith and conscience can be herd infallible yet many will presume whence heavy persecution shall arise on all who in the worship persevere of spirit and truth the rest far greater part well deem in outward rites and specious forms religion satisfied truth shall retire bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith rarely be found so shall the world go on to good malignant to bad men benign under her own weight groaning till the day appear of respiration to the just and vengeance to the wicked at return of him so lately promised to thy aid the woman's seed obscurely then foretold now amplier known thy saviour and thy lord last in the clouds from heaven to be revealed in glory of the father to dissolve satan with his perverted world then raise from the conflagrant mass purged and refined new heavens new earth ages of endless date founded in righteousness and peace and love to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss he ended and thus adam last replied how soon hath thy prediction seer blessed measured this transient world the raze of time till time stand fixed beyond is all abyss eternity whose end no eye can reach greatly instructed i shall hence depart greatly in peace of thought and have my fill of knowledge what this vessel can contain beyond which was my folly to aspire henceforth i learn that to obey is best and love with fear the only god to walk as in his presence ever to observe his providence and on him sole depend merciful over all his works with good still overcoming evil and by small accomplishing great things by things deemed weak subverting worldly strong and worldly wise by simply meek that suffering for truths sake is fortitude to highest victory and to the faithful death the gate of life taught this by his example whom i now acknowledge my redeemer ever blessed to whom thus also the angel last replied this having learned thou hast attained the sum of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers all secrets of the deep all nature's works or works of god in heaven air earth or sea and all the riches of this world enjoydst and all the rule one empire only add deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith add virtue patience temperance add love by name to come called charity the soul of all the rest then wilt thou not be loath to leave this paradise but shalt possess a paradise within thee happier far let us descend now therefore from this top of speculation for the hour precise exacts our parting hence and see the guards by me encamped on yonder hill expect their motion at whose front a flaming sword in signal of remove waves fiercely round we may no longer stay go waken eve her also i with gentle dreams have calmed portending good and all her spirits composed to meek submission thou at season fit let her with thee partake what thou hast herd chiefly what may concern her faith to know the great deliverance by her seed to come for by the woman's seed on all mankind that you may live which will be many days both in one faith unanimous though sad with cause for evils past yet much more cheered with meditation on the happy end he ended and they both descend the hill descended adam to the bower where eve lay sleeping ran before but found her waked and thus with words not sad she him received whence thou returnest and whither wentest i know for god is also in sleep and dreams advice which he hath sent propitious some great good presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress wearied i fell asleep but now led on in me is not delay with thee to go is to stay here without thee here to stay is to go hence unwilling thou to me art all things under heaven all places thou who for my wilful crime art banished hence this further consolation yet secure i carry hence though all by me is lost such favour i unworthy am voutsaft by me the promised seed shall all restore so spoke our mother eve and adam herd well pleased but answered not for now too nigh the archangel stood and from the other hill to their sixt station all in bright array the cherubin descended on the ground gliding meteorous as evening missed ris'n from a river over the marish glides and gathers ground fast at the labourers heel homeward returning high in front advanced the brandished sword of god before them blazed fierce as a comet which with torrid heat and vapour as the libyan air adust began to parch that temperate climb whereat in either hand the hastening angel caught our lingering parents and to the eastern gate led them direct and down the cliff as fast to the subjected plain then disappeered they looking back all the eastern side beheld of paradise so late their happy seat waved over by that flaming brand the gate with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms some natural tears they dropped but wiped them soon the world was all before them where

there bred a thousand young ones which she daily fed sucking upon her poisonous dugs eachone of sundry shapes yet all ill favoured soon as that uncouth light upon them shone into her mouth they crept and sudden all were gone their dam upstarted out of her den affray and rushed forth hurling her hideous tail about her cursed head whose folds displayed were stretched now forth at length without entrail she looked about and seeing one in mail armed to point sought back to turn again for light she hated as the deadly bale ay wont in desert darkness to remain where plain none might her see nor she see any plain which when the valiant elf perceiu'ed he leapt as lion fierce upon the flying prey and with his trenchant blade her boldly kept from turning back and forced her to stay therewith enraged she loudly gan to bray and turning fierce her speckled tail advanced threatening her angry sting him to dismay who nought aghast his mighty hand enhanced the stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glanced much daunted with that dint her sense was dazed yet kindling rage her self she gathered round and all atonce her beastly body raised with doubled forces high above the ground though wrapping up her wreathed stern around leapt fierce upon his shield and her huge train all suddenly about his body wound that hand or foot to stir he strove in vain god help the man so wrapped in errors endless train his lady sad to see his soar constraint cried out now now sir knight show what you be add faith unto your force and be not faint strangle her else she sure will strangle thee that when he herd in great perplexity his gall did grate for grief and high disdain and knitting all his force god one hand free wherewith he gripped her gorge with so great pain that soon to lose her wicked bans did her constrain therewith she spewed out of her filthy maw a flood of poison horrible and black full of great lumps of flesh and gobbets raw which stunk so vildly that it forced him slack his grasping hold and from her turn him back her vomit full of books and papers was with loathly frogs and toads which eyes did lack and creeping sought way in the weedy grass her filthy parbreak all the place defiled has as when old father nilus begins to swell with timely pride above the egyptian vale his fatty waves do fertile slime outwell and overflow each plain and lowly dale but when his later ebb begins to avail huge heaps of mud he leaves wherein there breed ten thousand kinds of creatures partly male and partly female of his fruitful feed such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed the same so soar annoyed has the knight that wellnigh choked with the deadly stink his forces fail ne can no longer fight whose courage when the fiend perceived to shrink she poured forth out of her hellish sink her fruitful cursed spawn of serpents small deformed monsters fowl and black as ink which swarming all about his legs did crawl and him encumbered soar but could not hurt at all as gentle shepherd in sweet eventide when ruddy phoebus begins to welk in west high on and hill his flock to viewen wide marks which do bite their hasty supper best a cloud of cumbrous gnats do him molest all striving to infix their feeble stings that from their noyance he no where can rest but with his clownish hands their tender wings he brushes oft and oft does mar their murmurings thus ill bestead and fearful more of shame then of the certain peril he stood in half furious unto his foe he came resolved in mind all suddenly to win or soon to loose before he once would lin and struck at her with more then manly force that from her body full of filthy since he rafther hateful head without remorse a stream of coal black blood forth gushed from her corpse her scattered brood soon as their parent deer they saw so rudely falling to the ground groaning full deadly all with troublous fear gathered themselves about her body round weening their wonted entrance to have found at her wide mouth but being there withstood they flocked all about her bleeding wound and sucked up their dying mother's blood making her death their life and eke her hurt their good that detestable sighed him much amazed to see unkindly imps of heaven accursed devour their dam on whom while so he gazed having all satisfied their bloody thirst their bellies swollen he saw with fullness burst and bowels gushing forth well worthy end of such as drunk her life the which them nursed now needs him no longer labour spend his foes have slain themselves with whom he should contend his lady seeing all that chanced from far approached in haste to greet his victory and said fair knight born under happy star who see your vanquished foes before you lie well worthy be you of that armory wherein you have great glory won this day and proved your strength on a strong enemy your first adventure many such i pray and henceforth ever wish that like succeed it may then mounted he upon his steed again and with the lady backward sought to weened that path he kept which beaten was most plain ne ever would to any byway bend but still did follow one unto the end the which at last out of the wood them brought so forward on his way with god to friend he passes forth and new adventure sought long way he traveled before he herd of ought at length they chanced to meet upon the way and aged sire in long black weeds clad his feet all bore his beard all hoary grey and by his belt his book he hanging had sober he seemed and very sagely sad and to the ground his eyes were lowly bent simple in show and void of malice bad and all the way he prayed as he went and often knock his breast as one that did repent he fair the knight saluted louting low who fair him quited as that courteous was and after asked him if he did know of strange adventures which abroad did pass ah my deer son quoth he how should alas silly old man that lives in hidden cell bidding his beads all day for his trespass tidings of war and worldly trouble tell with holy father sits not with such things to mell but if of danger which hereby does dwell and homebred evil evil you desire to hear of a strange man i can you tidings tell that wastes all this country far and near of such said he i chiefly do inquire and shall you well reward to show the place in which that wicked wight his days does wear for to all knighthood it is foul disgrace that such a cursed creature lives so long a space far hence quoth he in wasteful wilderness his dwelling is by which not lining wight may ever pass but through great distress now said the lady draws towards night and well i wot that of your later fight you all for wearied be for what so strong but wanting rest will also want of might the sun that measures heaven all day long at night does bait his steeds the ocean waves among then with the sun take sir your timely rest and with new day new work at once begin untroubled night they say gives counsel best right well sir knight you have advised been quoth then that aged man the way to win is wisely to advise now day is spent therefore with me you may take up your in for this same night the knight was well content so with that godly father to his home they went a little lowly hermitage it was down in a dale hard by a forests side far from resort of people that did pass in travel to and fro a little wide there was and holy chapel edified wherein the hermit duly wont to say his holy things each morn and eventide thereby a crystal stream did genlty play which from a sacred fountain welled forth always arrived there the little house they fill ne look for entertainment where none was rest is their feast and all things at their will the noblest mind the best contentment has with fair discourse the evening so they pass for that old man of pleasing words had store and well could file his tongue as smooth as glass he told of saints and popes and euemore he strewed and ave-mary after and before the drooping night thus creeps on them fast and the sad humour loading their eye lids as messenger of morpheus on them cast sweet slumbering dew the which to sleep them bids unto their lodgings then his guests he rids where when all drowned in deadly sleep he finds he to his study goes and there amidst his magic books and arts of sundry kinds he seeks out mighty charms to trouble sleepy minds then choosing out few words most horrible let none them read thereof did verses frame with which and other spells like terrible he bade awake black plutoes grisly dame and cursed heaven and spoke reproachful shame of highest god the lord of life and light a bold bad man that dared to call by name great gorgon prince of darkness and dead night at which cocytus quakes and styx is put to flight and forth he called out of deep darkness dreaded legions of sprights the which like little flies fluttering about his ever damned head await whereto their service he applies to aid his friends or fray his enemies of those he chosen out two the falsest twoo and fittest for to forge true-seeming lies the one of them he gave a message too the other by him self stayed other work to do he making speedy way through dispersed air and through the world of waters wide and deep to morpheus house does hastily repair amid the bowels of the earth full steep and low where dawning day does never peep his dwelling is there tethys his wet bed does ever wash and cynthia still does steep in silver dew his ever-drooping head while sad night over him her mantle black does spread whose double gates he finds locked fast the one fair framed of burnished ivory the other all with silver overcast and wakeful dogs before them far do lie watching to banish care their enemy who oft is wont to trouble gentle sleep by them the sprite does pass in quietly and unto morpheus comes whom drowned deep in drowsy fit he finds of nothing he takes keep and more to lull him in his slumber soft a trickling stream from high rock tumbling down and ever-drizzling rain upon the loft mixed with a murmuring wind much like the sown of swarming bees did cast him in a swown no other noise nor peoples troublous cries as still are wont t'annoy the walled town might there be herd but careless quiet lies wrapped in eternal silence far from enemies the messenger approaching to him spoke but his wast words returned to him in vain so found he slept that nought might him awake then rudely he him trust and pushed with pain whereat he gan to stretch but he again shook him so hard that forced him to speak as one then in a dream whose drier brain is tossed with troubled sights and fancies weak he mumbled soft but would not all his silence break the sprite then gan more boldly him to wake and threatened unto him the dreaded name of hecate whereat he gan to quake and lifting up his lumpish head with blame half angry asked him for what he came hither quoth he me archimago sent he that the stubborn sprites can wisely tame he bids thee to him send for his intent a fit false dream that can delude the sleepers sent the god obeyed and calling forth straight way a diverse dream out of his prison dark delivered it to him and down did lay his heavy head devoid of careful cark whose senses all were straight benumbed and stark he back returning by the ivory door remounted up as light as cheerful lark and on his little wings the dream he boar in haste unto his lord where he him left afore who all this while with charms and hidden arts had made a lady of that other spright and framed of liquid air her tender parts so lively and so like in all men's sighed that weaker sense it could have ravished quite the maker self for all his wondrous wit was nigh beguiled with so goodly sighed her all in white he clad and over it cast a black stole most like to seem for vna fit now when that idle dream was to him brought unto that elfin knight he bade him fly where he slept soundly void of evil thought and with false shows abuse his fantasy in sort as he him schooled privily and that new creature born without her due full of the makers guile with usage fly he taught to imitate that lady true whose semblance she did carry under feigned hew thus well instructed to their work they hast and coming where the knight in slumber lay the one upon his hardy head him placed and made him dream of loves and lustful play that nigh his manly heart did melt away bathed in wanton bliss and wicked joy then seemed him his lady by him lay and to him plained how that false winged boy her chaste heart had subdued to learn dame pleasures toy and she her self of beauty sovereign queen fair venus seemed unto his bed to bring her whom he waking evermore did ween to be the chastest flower that ay did spring on earthly branch the daughter of a king now a lose leman to vile service bound and eke the graces seemed all to sing hymen ιο̃ hymen dancing all around while freshest flora her ivy garland crowned in this great passion of unwonted lust or wonted fear of doing ought amiss he started up as seeming to mistrust some secret ill or hidden foe of his lo there before his face his lady is under black stole hiding her baited hook and as half blushing offered him to kiss with gentle blandishment and lovely look most like that virgin true which for her knight him took all clean dismayed to see so uncouth sighed and half enraged at her shameless guise he thought have slain her in his fierce despite but hasty heat tempering with sufferance wise he stayed his hand and gan himself advise to prove his sense and tempt her feigned truth wringing her hands in women's piteous wise though can she weep to stir up gentle ruth both for her noble blood and for her tender youth and said ah sir my liege lord and my love shall i accuse the hidden cruel fate and mighty causes wrought in heaven above or the blind god that does me thus amate for hoped love to win me certain hate yet thus perforce he bids me do or die die is my due yet rew my wretched state you whom my hard avenging destiny hath made judge of my life or death indifferently your own deer sake forced me at first to leave my father's kingdom there she stopped with tears her swollen heart her speech seemed to bereave and then again begun my weaker years captived to fortune and frail worldly fears fly to your faith for succour and sure aid let me not die in languor and long tears why dame quoth he what hath you thus dismayed what frays you that were wont to comfort me afraid love of your self she said and deer constraint lets me not sleep but wast the weary night in secret anguish and unpitied plaint while you in careless sleep are drowned quite her doubtful words made that redoubted knight suspect her truth yet since not untruth he knew her fawning love with foul disdainful spite he would not shend but said dear dame i rew that for my sake unknown such grief unto you grew assure your self it fell not all to ground for all so deer as life is to my heart i deem your love and hold me to you bound ne let vain fears procure your needless smart where cause is none but to your rest depart not all content yet seemed she to appease her mournful plaints beguiled of her art and fed with words that could not choose but please so sliding softly forth she turned as to her ease long after lay he musing at her mood much grieved to think that gentle dame so light for whose defence he was to shed his blood at last dull weariness of former fight having rocked a sleep his irksome spright that troublous dream gan freshly toss his brain with bowers and beds and ladies deer delight but when he saw his labour all was vain with that misformed spright he back returned again cant. ii the guileful great enchanter parts the redcrosse knight from truth into whose stead fair falsehood steps and works him woeful ruth by this the northern wagoner had set his sevenfold teem behind the steadfast star that was in ocean waves yet never wet but firm is fixed and sends light from far to all that in the wide deep wandering are and cheerful chanticleer with his note shrill had warned once that phoebus fiery car in haste was climbing up the eastern hill full envious that night so long his room did fill when those accursed messengers of hell that feigning dream and that fair-forged spright came to their wicked master and gan tell their bootless pains and ill succeeding night who all in rage to see his skilful might deluded so gan threaten hellish pain and sad proserpines wrath them to affright but when he saw his threatening was but vain he cast about and searched his baleful books again eftsoones he took that miscreated fair and that false other spright on whom he spread a seeming body of the subtle air like a young squire in loves and lustihood his wanton days that ever loosely led without regard of arms and dreaded fight those two he took and in a secret bed covered with darkness and misdeeming night them both together laid to joy in vain delight forthwith he runs with feigned faithful haste unto his guest who after troublous sights and dreams gan now to take more found repast whom suddenly he wakes with fearful frights as one aghast with fiends or damned sprights and to him calls rise rise unhappy swain that here wex old in sleep while wicked wights have knit themselves in venus shameful chain come see where your false lady does her honour stain all in amaze he suddenly up start with sword in hand and with the old man went who soon him brought into a secret part where that false couple were full closely meant in wanton lust and lewd embracement which when he saw he burned with jealous fire the eye of reason was with rage blinded and would have slain them in his furious ire but hardly was restrained of that aged sire returning to his bed in torment great and bitter anguish of his guilty sighed he could not rest but did his stout heart eat and wast his inward gall with deep despite irksome of life and too long lingering night at last fair hesperus in highest sky had spent his lamp & brought forth dawning light then up he rose and clad him hastily the dwarf him brought his steed so both away do fly now when the rosy-fingered morning fair weary of aged tithones saffron bed had spread her purple robe through dewy air and the high hills titan discovered the royal virgin shook off drowsihood and rising forth out of her baser bower looked for her knight who far away was fled and for her dwarf that wont to wait each hour then gan she wail & weep to see that woeful stour and after him she road with so much speed as her slow beast could make but all in vain for him so far had born his lightfoot steed pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdain that him to follow was but fruitless pain yet she her weary limbs would never rest but every hill and dale each wood and plain did search soar grieved in her gentle breast he so ungently left her whom she love best but subtle archimago when his guests he saw divided into double parts and vna wandering in woods and forests th'end of his drift he praised his devilish arts that had such might over true meaning hearts yet rests not so but other means does make how he may work unto her further smarts for her he hated as the hissing snake and in her many troubles did most pleasure take he then devised himself how to disguise for by his mighty science he could take as many forms and shapes in seeming wise as ever proteus to himself could make sometime a fowl sometime a fish in lake now like a fox now like a dragon fell that of himself he oft for fear would quake and oft would fly away o who can tell the hidden power of herbs and might of magic spell but now seemed best the person to put on of that good knight his late beguiled guest in mighty arms he was clad anon and silver shield upon his coward breast a bloody cross and on his craven crest a bunch of hairs discoloured diversely full jolly knight he seemed and well addressed and when he sat upon his courser free saint george himself you would have deemed him to be but he the knight whose semblant he did bear the true saint george was wandered far away still flying from his thoughts and jealous fear will was his guide and grief led him astray at last him chanced to meet upon the way a faithless sarazin all armed to point in whose great shield was writ with letters gay sans foy full large of limb and every joint he was and cared not for god or man a point he had a fair companion of his way a goodly lady clad in scarlet read purfled with gold and pearl of rich assay and like a persian mitre on her head she wore with crowns and ouches garnished the which her lavish lovers to her gave her wanton palfrey all was overspread with tinsel trappings woven like a wave whose bridle rung with golden bells and boss's brave with fair disport and courting dalliance she entertained her lover all the way but when she saw the knight his spear advance she soon left off her mirth and wanton play and bade her knight address him to the fray his foe was nigh at hand he pricked with pride and hope to win his ladies heart that day forth spurred fast adown his coursers side the read blood trickling stained the way as he did ride the knight of the redcrosse when him he spied spurring so hight with rage dispiteous gan fairly couch his spear and towards ride soon meet they both both fell and furious that daunted with their forces hideous their steeds do stagger and amazed stand and eke themselves too rudely rigorous astonished with the stroke of their own hand do back rebut and each to other yields land as when two rams stirred with ambitious pride fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flock their horned fronts so fierce on either side do meet that with the terror of the shock astonished both stand senseless as ablocke forgetful of the hanging victory so stood these twaine unmoved as a rock both staring fierce and holding idly the broken relics of their former cruelty the sarazin soar daunted with the buff snatches his sword and fiercely to him flies who well it wards and quites cuff with cuff each others equal puissance envies and through their iron sides with cruelties does seek to pierce repining courage yields no foot to foe the flashing fire flies as from a forge out of their burning shields and streams of purple blood new die the verdant fields curse on that cross quoth then the saracen that keeps thy body from the bitter fit dead long ago i wot thou hadst been had not that charm from thee forwarned it but yet i warn thee now assured sit and hide thy head therewith upon his crest with rigour so outrageous he smit that a large share it hewed out of the rest and glancing down his shield from blame him fairly blessed who thereat wondrous wroth the sleeping spark of native virtue gan eftsoons revive and at his haughty helmet making mark so hugely stroke that it the steel did rive and cleft his head he tumbling down alive with bloody mouth his mother earth did kiss greeting his graven his grudging ghost did strive with the frail flesh at last it flitted is whither the souls do fly of men that live amiss the lady when she saw her champion fallen like the old ruins of a broken tower stayed not to wail his woeful funeral but from him fled away with all her pour who after her as hastily gan scour bidding the dwarf with him to bring away the sarazins shield sign of the conqueror her soon he overtook and bade to stay for present cause was none of dread her to dismay she turning back with rueful countenance cried mercy mercy sir vouchsafe to show on silly dame subject to hard mischance and to your mighty will her humbleness low in so rich weeds and seeming glorious show did much emmove his stout heroic heart and said dear dame your sudden overthrow much rues me but now put fear apart and tell both who you be and who that took your part melting in tears then gan she thus lament the wretched woman whom unhappy hour hath now made thrall to your commandment before that angry heavens lift to lower and fortune false betrayed me to your pour was oh what now avails that i was born the sole daughter of and emperor he that the wide west under his rule has and high hath set his throne where tiberis does pass he in the first flower of my freshest age betrothed me unto the only hair of a most mighty king most rich and sage was never prince so faithful and so fair was never prince so meek and debonair but ere my hoped day of spousal shone my dearest lord fell from high honours stair into the hands of his accursed foes and cruelly was slain that shall i ever moan his blessed body spoiled of lively breath was afterwards i know not how conveyed and from me hid of whose most innocent death when tidings came to me unhappy maid oh how great sorrow my sad soul assayed then forth i went his woeful corpse to find and many years throughout the world i strayed a virgin widow whose deep wounded mind with love long time did languish as the stricken hind at last it chanced this proud sarazin to meet me wandering who perforce me led with him away but yet could never win the fort that ladies hold in sovereign dread there lies he now with foul dishonour dead who while he lived was called proud sans foy the eldest of three brothers all three bred of one bad sire whose youngest is sans joy and betwixt them both was born the bloody bold sans loy in this sad plighted friendless unfortunate now miserable i fidessa dwell craving of you in pity of my state to do none ill if please you not do well he in great passion all this while did dwell more busying his quick eyes her face to view then his dull ears to hear what she did tell and said fair lady heart of flint would rew the undeserved woes and sorrows which you show henceforth in safe assurance may you rest having both found a new friend you to aid and lost and old foe that did you molest better new friend then and old foe is said with change of cheer the seeming simple maid let fallen her eyes as shamefast to the earth and yielding soft in that she nought gainsaid so forth they road he feigning seemly mirth and she coy looks so dainty they say makes dearth longtime they thus together traveled till weary of their way they came at last where grew two goodly trees that fair did spread their arms abroad with grey moss overcast and their green leaves trembling with every blast made a calm shadow far in compass round the fearful shepherd often there aghast under them never sat ne wont there found his merry oaten pipe but shunned th'vnlucky ground but this good knight soon as he them can spy for the cool shade thither hastily god for golden phoebus now that mounted high from fiery wheels of his fair chariot hurled his beam so scorching cruel hight that living creature mote it not abide and his new lady it endured not there they alight in hope themselves to hide from the fierce heat and rest their weary limbs a tide fair seemly pleasance each to other makes with goodly purposes there as they fit and in his falsed fancy he her takes to be the fairest wight that lived yet which to express he bends his gentle wit and thinking of those branches green to frame a garland for her dainty forehead fit he plucked a bough out of whose rift there came small drops of gory blood that trickled down the same therewith a piteous yelling voice was herd crying oh spare with guilty hands to tear my tender sides in this rough rind embarred but fly ah fly far hence away for fear lest to you hap that happened to me hear and to this wretched lady my deer love oh too deer love love bought with death too deer astoned he stood and up his hair did hove and with that sudden horror could no member move at last whenas the dreadful passion was overpassed and manhood well awake yet musing at the strange occasion and doubting much his sense he thus bespoke what voice of damned ghost from limbo lake or guileful spright wandering in empty air both which frail men do oftentimes mistake sends to my doubtful ears these speeches rare and rueful plaints me bidding guitless blood to spare then groaning deep nor damned ghost quoth he nor guileful sprite to thee these words does speak but once a man fradubio now a tree wretched man wretched tree whose nature weak a cruel witch her cursed will to wreak hath thus transformed and placed in open plains where boar as does blow full bitter bleak and scorching sun does dry my secret veins for though a tree i seem yet cold and heat me pains say on fradubio then or man or tree quoth then the knight by whose mischievous arts art thou misshapen thus as now i see he oft finds medicine who his grief imparts but double griefs afflict concealing hearts as raging flames who strives to suppress the author then said he of all my smarts is one duessa a false sorceress that many errant knights hath brought to wretchedness in prime of youthly years when courage hight the fire of love and joy of chivalry first kindled in my breast it was my lot to love this gentle lady whom you see now not a lady but a seeming tree with whom as once i road accompanied me chanced of a knight encountered be that had a like fair lady by his side like a fair lady but did fowl duessa hide whose forged beauty he did take in hand all other dams to have exceeded far i in defence of mine did likewise stand mine that did then shine as the morning star so both to battle fierce arranged are in which his harder fortune was to fallen under my spear such is the die of war his lady left as a prize martial did yield her comely person to be at my call so doubly loved of ladies unlike fair th'one seeming such the other such indeed one day in doubt i cast for to compare whither in beauty's glory did exceed a rosy garland was the victor's meed both seemed to win and both seemed wone to be so hard the discord was to be agreed fraelissa was as fair as fair mote be and ever false duessa seemed as fair as she the wicked witch now seeing all this while the doubtful balance equally to sway what not by right she cast to win by guile and by her hellish science raised straight way a foggy missed that overcast the day and a dull blast that breathing on her face dimmed her former beauty's shining ray and with foul ugly form did her disgrace then was she fair alone when none was fair in place then cried she out fie fie deformed wight whose borrowed beauty now appears plain to have before bewitched all men's sighed oh leave her soon or let her soon be slain her loathly visage viewing with disdain eftsoons i thought her such as she me told and would have killed her but with feigned pain the false witch did my wrathful hand withhold so left her where she now is turned to treen mould then forth i took duessa for my dame and in the witch vnweening joyed long time ne ever wist but that she was the same till on a day that day is every prime when witches wont do penance for their crime i chanced to see her in her proper hew bathing her self in oregano and thyme a filthy foul old woman i did view that ever to have touched her i did deadly rew her nether parts misshapen monstruous were hid in water that i could not see but they did seem more foul and hideous then woman's shape man would believe to be then forth from her most beastly company i gan refrain in mind to slip away soon as appeared safe opportunity for danger great if not assured decay i saw before mine eyes if i were known to stray the devilish hag by changes of my cheer perceived my thought and drowned in sleepy night with wicked herbs and ointments did besmear my body all through charms and magic might that all my senses were bereaved quite then brought she me into this desert waste and by my wretched lovers side me pight where now enclosed in wooden walls full fast banished from living wights our weary days we waste but how long time said then the elfin knight are you in this misformed house to dwell we may not change quoth he this evil plighted till we be bathed in a lining well that is the term prescribed by the spell o how said he mote i that well out find that may restore you to your wonted well time and sufficed fates to former kind shall us restore none else from hence may us unbind the false duessa now fidessa hight herd how in vain fradubio did lament and knew well all was true but the good knight full of sad fear and ghastly dreariment when all this speech the living tree had spent the bleeding bough did thrust into the ground that from the blood he might be innocent and with fresh clay did close the wooden wound then turning to his lady dead with fear her found her seeming dead he found with feigned fear as all unweeting of that well she knew and pained himself with busy care to rear her out of careless swown her eyelids blew and dimmed sighed with pale and deadly hew at last she up gan lift with trembling cheer her up he took too simple and too true and oft her kissed at length all passed fear he set her on her steed and forward forth did bear cant. iii forsaken truth long seeks her love and makes the lion mild mars blind devotions mars and falls in hand of lecher vild nought is there under heavens wide hollowness that moves more deer compassion of mind then beauty brought unworthy wretchedness through envies snares or fortune's freaks unkind i whither lately through her brightness blind or through allegiance and fast fealty which i do owe unto all woman kind feel my heart pierced with so great agony when such i see that all for pity i could die and now it is impassioned so deep for fairest vnaes sake of whom i sing that my frail eyes these lines with tears do steep to think how she through guileful handling though true as touch though daughter of a king though fair as ever living wight was fair though nor in word nor deed ill meriting is from her knight divorced in despair and her due loves derived to that vile witches share yet she most faithful lady all this while forsaken woeful solitary maid far from all peoples press as in exile in wilderness and wasteful deserts strayed to seek her knight who subtly betrayed through that late vision which th'enchaunter wrought had her abandoned she of nought afraid through woods and wastness wide him daily sought yet wished tidings none of him unto her brought one day nigh weary of the irksome way from her unhasty beast she did alight and on the grass her dainty limbs did lay in secret shadow far from all men's sighed from her fair head her fillet she undight and laid her stole aside her angels face as the great eye of heaven shined bright and made a sunshine in the shady place did never mortal eye behold such heavenly grace it fortuned out of the thickest wood a ramping lion rushed suddenly hunting full greedy after salvage blood soon as the royal virgin he did spy with gaping mouth at her ran greedily to have atonce devoured her tender corpse but to the prey when as he drew more nigh his bloody rage assuaged with remorse and with the sighed amazed forgot his furious force in stead thereof he kissed her weary feet and licked her lily hands with fawning tonge as he her wronged innocence did weet o how can beauty master the most strong and simple truth subdue avenging wrong whose yielded pride and proud submission still dreading death when she had marked long her heart gan melt in great compassion and drizzling tears did shed for pure affection the lion lord of every beast in field quoth she his princely puissance does abate and mighty proud to humble weak does yield forgetful of the hungry rage which late him pricked in pity of my sad estate but he my lion and my noble lord how does he find in cruel heart to hate her that him loved and ever most adored as the god of my life why hath he me abhorred redounding tears did choke th'end of her plaint which softly echoed from the neighbour wood and sad to see her sorrowful constraint the kingly beast upon her gazing stood with pity calmed down fell his angry mood at last in close heart shutting up her pain arose the virgin born of heavenly brood and to her snowy palfrey god again to seek her strayed champion if she might attain the lion would not leave her desolate but with her went along as a strong guard of her chaste person and a faithful mate of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard still when she slept he kept both watch and ward and when she waked he waited diligent with humble service to her will prepared from her fair eyes he took commandment and ever by her looks conceived her intent long she thus traveled through deserts wide by which she thought her wandering knight should pass yet never show of living wight espied till that at length she found the trodden grass in which the tract of peoples footing was under the steep foot of a mountain hoar the same she follows till at last she has a damosel spied slow footing her before that on her shoulders sad a pot of water boar to whom approaching she to her gan call to weet if dwelling place were nigh at hand but the rude wench her answered nought at all she could not hear nor speak nor understand till seeing by her side the lion stand with sudden fear her pitcher down she threw and fled away for never in that land face of fair lady she before did view and that dread lyons look her cast in deadly hew full fast she fled ne ever looked behind as if her life upon the wager lay and home she came whereas her mother blind sat in eternal night nought could she say but sudden catching hold did her dismay with quaking hands and other signs of fear who full of ghastly fright and cold affray gan shut the door by this arrived there dame vna weary dame and entrance did require which when none yielded her unruly page with his rude claws the wicket open rend and let her in where of his cruel rage nigh dead with fear and faint astonishment she found them both in darksome corner penned where that old woman day and night did pray upon her beads devoutly penitent nine hundred pater noster's every day and thrice nine hundred aves she was wont to say and to augment her painful penance more thrice every week in ashes she did fit and next her wrinkled skin rough sackcloth wore and thrice three times did fast from any bit but now for fear her beads she did forget whose needless dread for to remove away fair vna framed words and countenance fit which hardly done at length she gan them pray that in their cottage small that night she rest her may the day is spent and comes drowsy night when every creature shrouded is in sleep sad vna down her lays in weary plighted and at her feet the lion watch does keep in stead of rest she does lament and weep for the late loss of her deer loved knight and sighs and groans and evermore does steep her tender breast in bitter tears all night all night she thinks too long and often looks for light now when aldeboran was mounted high above the shiny cassiopeias chair and all in deadly sleep did drowned lie one knocked at the door and in would fare he knocked fast and often cursed and sware that ready entrance was not at his call for on his back a heavy load he bore of nightly stealths and pillage several which he had god abroad by purchase criminal he was to weet a stout and sturdy thief wont to rob churches of their ornaments and poor men's boxes of their due relief which given was to them for good intents the holy saints of their rich vestments he did disrobe when all men careless slept and spoiled the priests of their habiliments while none the holy things in safety kept then he by cunning sleights in at the window crept and all that he by right or wrong could find unto this house he brought and did bestow upon the daughter of this woman blind abessa daughter of corceca slow with whom he whoredom used that few did know and fed her fat with feast of offerings and plenty which in all the land did grow ne spared he to give her gold and rings and now he to her brought part of his stolen things thus long the door with rage and threats he bet yet of those fearful women none durst rise the lion frayed them him in to let he would no longer stay him to advise but open breaks the door in furious wise and entering is when that disdainful beast encountering fierce him sudden does surprise and seizing cruel claws on trembling breast under his lordly foot him proudly hath suppressed him boots not resist nor succour call his bleeding heart is in the venger's hand who straight him rend in thousand pieces small and quite dismembered hath the thirsty land drunk up his life his corpse left on the strand his fearful friends wear out the woeful night ne dare to weep nor seem to understand the heavy hap which on them is alight afraid lest to themselves the like mishappen might now when broad day the world discovered has up vna rose up rose the lion eke and on their former journey forward pass in ways unknown her wandering knight to seek with pains far passing that long wandering greek that for his love refused deity such were the labours of this lady meek still seeking him that from her still did fly then furthest from her hope when most she weenednie soon as she parted thence the fearful twaine that blind old woman and her daughter deer came forth and finding kirkrapine there slain for anguish great they gan to rend their hear and beatrice their breasts and naked flesh to tear and when they both had wept and wailed their fill then forth they ran like two amazed deer half mad through malice and revenging will to follow her that was the causer of their ill whom overtaking they gan loudly bray with hollow howling and lamenting cry shamefully at her railing all the way and her accusing of dishonesty that was the flower of faith and chastity and still amid her railing she did pray that plagues and mischiefs and long misery might fallen on her and follow all the way and that in endless error she might ever stray but when she saw her prayers nought prevail she back returned with some labour lost and in the way as she did weep and wail a knight her met in mighty arms embossed yet knight was not for all his bragging boast but subtle archimag that vna sought by trains into new troubles to have tossed of that old woman tidings he besought if that of such a lady she could tellen ought therewith she gan her passion to renew and cry and curse and rail and rend her hear saying that harlot she too lately knew that caused her shed so many a bitter tear and so forth told the story of her fear much seemed he to moan her hapless chance and after for that lady did inquire which being taught he forward gan advance ▪ his fair enchanted steed and eke his charmed lance ere long he came where vna traveled slow and that wild champion waiting her beside whom seeing such for dread he durst not show himself too nigh at hand but turned wide unto and hill from whence when she him spied by his like seeming shield her knight by name she weened it was and towards him gan ride approaching nigh she wist it was the same and with fair fearful humbleness towards him she came and weeping said ah my long lacked lord where have you be thus long out of my sighed much feared i to have be quite abhorred or ought have done that you displeasen might that should as death unto my deer heart light for since mine eye your joyous sighed did miss my cheerful day is turned to cheerless night and eke my night of death the shadow is but welcome now my light and shining lamp of bliss he thereto meeting said my dearest dame far be it from your thought and from my will to think that knighthood i so much should shame as you to leave that have me loved still and chosen in fairy court of mere goodwill where noblest knights were to be found on earth the earth shall sooner leave her kindly skill to bring forth fruit and make eternal dearth then i leave you my lief born of heavenly berth and sooth to say why i left you so long was for to seek adventure in strange place where archimago said a felon strong to many knights did daily work disgrace but knight he now shall never more deface good cause of mine excuse that mote you please well to accept and evermore embrace my faithful service that by land and seas have vowed you to defend now then your plaint appease his lovely words her seemed due recompense of all her passed pains one loving hour for many years of sorrow can dispense a dram of sweet is worth a pound of sour she has forgotten how many a woeful stour for him she late endured she speaks no more of past true is that true love hath no pour to looken back his eyes be fixed before before her stands her knight for whom she toiled so soar much like as when the beaten mariner that long hath wandered in the ocean wide oft soused in swelling tethys saltish tear and long time having tanned his tawny hide with blustering breath of heaven that none can bide and scorching flames of fierce orions hound soon as the port from far he has espied his cheerful whistle merrily does found and nereus crowns with cups his mates him pledge around such joy made vna when her knight she found and eke th'enchaunter joyous seemed no less then the glad merchant that does view from ground his ship far come from watery wilderness he hurls out vows and neptune oft does bless so forth they passed and all the way they spent discoursing of her dreadful late distress in which he asked her what the lion meant who told her all that fell in journey as she went they had not ridden far when they might see one pricking towards them with hasty heat full strongly armed and on a courser free that through his fierceness foamed all with swear and the sharp iron did for anger eat when his hight rider spurred his chafed side his look was stern and seemed still to threat cruel revenge which he in heart did hide and on his shield sans loy in bloody lines was died when nigh he drew unto this gentle pair and saw the redcross which the knight did bear he burned in fire and gan eftsoons prepare himself to battle with his couched spear lo thwas that other and did faint through fea to taste tried dint of deadly steel but yet his lady did so well him cheer that hope of new goodhap he gan to feel so bent his spear and spurned his horse with iron heel but that proud paynim forward came so fierce and full of wrath that with his sharp-head spear through vainly crossed shield he quite did pierce and had his staggering steed not shrunk for fear through shield and body eke he should him bear yet so great was the puissance of his push that from his saddle quite he did him bear he tumbling rudely down to ground did rush and from his gored wound a well of blood did gush dismounting lightly from his lofty steed he to him leapt in mind to reave his life and proudly said lo there the worthy meed of him that slew sansfoy with bloody knife henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife in peace may passen over lethe lake when morning altars purged with enemies life the black infernal furies done aslake life from sansfoy thou tookest sansloy shall from thee take therewith in haste his helmet gan unlace till vna cried oh hold that heavy hand dear sir what ever that thou be in place enough is that thy foe does vanquished stand now at thy mercy mercy not withstand for he is one the truest knight alive though conquered now he lie on lowly land and whilst him fortune favoured fair did thrive in bloody field therefore of life him not deprive her piteous words might not abate his rage but rudely rending up his helmet would have slain him straight but when he sees his age and hoary head of archimago old his hasty hand he does amazed hold and half ashamed wondered at the sighed for the old man well knew he though untold in charms and magic to have wondrous might ne ever wont in field ne in round lists to fight and said why archimago luckless sire what do i see what hard mishap is this that hath thee hither brought to taste mineyre or thine the fault or mine the error is in stead of foe to wound my friend amiss he answered nought but in a trance still lay and on those guileful dazed eyes of his the cloud of death did fit which done away he left him lying so ne would no longer stay but to the virgin comes who all this while amazed stands her self so mocked to see by him who has the guerdon of his guile for so misfeigning her true knight to be yet is she now in more perplexity left in the hand of that same paynim bold from whom her boots not at all to fly who by her cleanly garment catching hold her from her palfrey plucked her visage to behold but her fierce servant full of kingly awe and high disdain whenas his sovereign dame so rudely handled by her foe he saw with gaping jaws full greedy at him came and ramping on his shield did ween the same have reft away with his sharp rending claws but he was stout and lust did now inflame his courage more that from his gripping paws he hath his shield redeemed and forth his sword he draws o then too weak and feeble was the force of salvage beast his puissance to withstand for he was strong and of so mighty corpse as ever wielded spear in warlike hand and feats of arms did wisely understand eftsoones he pierced through his chafed chest with thrilling point of deadly iron brand and launched his lordly heart with death oppressed he roared aloud while life forsook his stubborn breast who now is left to keep the forlorn maid from raging spoil of lawless victor's will her faithful guard removed her hope dismayed her self a yielded prey to save or spill he now lord of the fied his pride to fill with foul reproaches and disdainful spite her vildly entertains and will or nill bears her away upon his courser light her prayers nought prevail his rage is more of might and all the way with great lamenting pain and piteous plaints she fills his dull ears that stony heart could riven have in twaine and all the way she wets with flowing tears but he enraged with rancour nothing hears her servile beast yet would not leave her so but follows her far off ne ought he fears to be partaker of her wandering woe more mild in beastly kind then that her beastly foe cant. iiii to sinful house of pride duessa guides the faithful knight where brother's death to wreak sansioy does challenge him to fight young knight what ever that dost arms profess and through long labours huntest after fame beware of fraud beware of fickleness in choice and change of thy deer loved dame lest thou of her believe too lightly blame and rash misweening do thy heart remove for unto knight there is no greater shame then lightness and inconstancy in love that does this redcrosse knights ensample plainly prove who after that he had fair vna lost through light misdeeming of her loyalty and false duessa in her stead had born called fidess ' and so supposed to be long with her traveled till at last they see a goodly building bravely garnished the house of mighty prince it seemed to be and towards it a broad high way that led all bore through peoples feet which thither traveled great troops of people traveled thitherward both day and night of each degree and place but few returned having escaped hard with baleful beggary or foul disgrace which ever after in most wretched case like loathsome lazars by the hedges lay thither duessa bade him bend his pace for she is weary of the toilsome way and also nigh consumed is the lingering day a stately palace built of squared brick which cunningly was without mortar laid whose walls were high but nothing strong nor thick and golden foil all over them displayed that purest sky with brightness they dismayed high lifted up were many lofty towers and goodly galleries far over laid full of fair windows and delightful bowers and on the top a dial told the timely hours it was a goodly heap for to behold and spoke the praises of the workman's wit but full great pity that so fair a mould did on so weak foundation ever fit for on a sandy hill that still did flit and fallen away it mounted was full high that every breath of heaven shaked it and all the hinder parts that few could spy were ruinous and old but painted cunningly arrived there they passed in forth right for still to all the gates stood open wide yet charge of them was to a porter hight called maluenù who entrance none denied thence to the hall which was on every side with rich array and costly arras dight infinite sorts of people did abide there waiting long to win the wished sighed of her that was the lady of that palace bright by them they pass all gazing on them round and to the presence mount whose glorious view their frail amazed senses did confound in living princes court none ever knew such endless richesse and so sumptuous show ne persia self the nurse of pompous pride like ever saw and there a noble crew of lords and ladies stood on every side which with their presence fair the place much beautified high above all a cloth of state was spread and a rich throne as bright as sunny day on which there sat most brave embellished with royal robes and gorgeous array a maiden queen that shone as titans ray in glistering gold and peerless precious stone yet her bright blazing beauty did assay to dim the brightness of her glorious throne as envying her self that too exceeding shone exceeding shone like phoebus fairest child that did presume his father's firy wain and flaming mouths of steeds unwonted wild through highest heaven with weaker hand to rain proud of such glory and advancement vain while flashing beams do daze his feeble eyes he leaves the welkin way most beaten plain and rapt with whirling wheels inflames the dyen with fire not made to burn but fairly for to shine so proud she shined in her princely state looking to heaven for earth she did disdain and sitting high for lowly she did hate lo underneath her scornful feet was lain a dreadful dragon with and hideous train and in her hand she held a mirror bright wherein her face she often viewed fain and in her self-loved semblance took delight for she was wondrous fair as any living wight of grisly pluto she the daughter was and sad proserpina the queen of hell yet did she think her peerless wrath to pass that parentage with pride so did she swell and thundering ioue that high in heaven does dwell and wield the world she claimed for her sire or if that any else did ioue excel for to the highest she did still aspire or if ought higher were then that did it desire and proud lucifera men did her call that made her self queen and crowned to be yet rightful kingdom she had none at all ne heritage of native sovereignty but did usurp with wrong and tyranny upon the sceptre which she now did hold ne ruled her realms with laws but policy and strong advisement of six wizards old that with their counsels bade her kingdom did uphold soon as the elfing knight in presence came and false duessa seeming lady fair a gentle usher vanity by name made room and passage for them did prepare so goodly brought them to the lowest stair of her high throne where they on humble knee making obeisance did the cause declare why they were come her royal state to see to prove the wide report of her great majesty with lofty eyes half loath to look so low she thanked them in her disdainful wise ne other grace vouchsafed them to show of princess worthy scarce them bade arise her lords and ladies all this while devise themselves to setten forth to strangers sighed some frounce their curled hair in courtly guise some prank their ruffs and others trimly dight their gay attire each others greater pride does spite goodly they all that knight do entertain right glad with him to have increased their crew but to duess ' each one himself did pain all kindness and fair courtesy to show for in that court whilom her well they knew yet the stout faery amongst the midst crowd thought all their glory vain in knightly view and that great princess too exceeding proud that to strange knight no better countenance allowed sudden uprises from her stately place the royal dame and for her coach does call all hurtlen forth and she with princely pace as fair aurora in her purple pall out of the east the dawning day does call so forth she comes her brightness broad does blaze the heaps of people thronging in the hall do ride each other upon her to gaze her glorious glitter and light does all men's eyes amaze so forth she comes and to her coach does climb adorned all with gold and girlands gay that seemed as fresh as flora in her prime and strove to match in royal rich array great iunoes golden chair the which they say the gods stand gazing on when she does ride to ioues high house through heavens brass-paved way drawn of fair peacocks that excel in pride and full of argus eyes their tails dispreaden wide but this was drawn of six unequal beasts on which her six sage counsellors did ride taught to obey their bestial behests with like conditions to their kinds applied of which the first that all the rest did guide was sluggish idleness the nurse of since upon a slothful ass he chosen to ride arrayed in habit black and amiss thin like to and holy monk the service to begin and in his hand his portess still he bore that much was worn but therein little read for of devotion he had little care still drowned in sleep and most of his days dead scarce could he once uphold his heavy head to looken whither it were night or day may seem the wain was very evil led when such and one had guiding of the way that knew not whither right he went or else astray from worldly cares himself he did esloyne and greatly shunned manly exercise for every work he challenged essoin for contemplation sake yet otherwise his life he led in lawless riotise by which he grew to grievous malady for in his lustless limbs through evil guise a shaking fever reigned continually such one was idleness first of this company and by his side road loathsome gluttony deformed creature on a filthy swine his belly was upblown with luxury and eke with fatness swollen were his eyes and like a crane his neck was long and fine with which he swallowed up excessive feast for want whereof poor people oft did pine and all the way most like a brutish beast he spewed up his gorge that all did him detest in green vine leaves he was right fitly clad for other clothes he could not wear for heat and on his head and ivy garland had from under which fast trickled down the sweat still as he road he somewhat still did eat and in his hand did bear a bouzing can of which he supped so oft that on his seat his drunken corpse he scarce upholden can in shape and life more like a monster then a man unfit he was for any worldly thing and eke unable once to stir or go not meet to be of counsel to a king whose mind in meat and drink was drowned so that from his friend he seldom knew his so full of diseases was his carcase blew and a dry dropsy through his flesh did flow which by misdiet daily greater grew such one was gluttony the second of that crew and next to him road lustful lechery upon a bearded goat whose rugged hair and whally eyes the sign of jealousy was like the person self whom he did bear who rough and black and filthy did appear unseemly man to please fair ladies eye yet he of ladies oft was loved deer when fairer faces were bid standen by oh who does know the bent of women's fantasy in a green gown he clothed was full fair which underneath did hide his filthiness and in his hand a burning heart he bore full of vain follies and new fangleness for he was false and fraught with sicklenesse and learned had to love with secret looks and well could dance and sing with ruefulness and fortune's tell and read in loving books and thousand other ways to bait his fleshly hooks inconstant man that loved all he saw and lusted after all that he did love ne would his looser life be tide to law but joyed weak women's hearts to tempt and prove if from their loyal loves he might them move which lewdness filled him with reproachful pain of that fowl evil which all men reprove that rots the marrow and consumes the brain such one was lechery the third of all this train and greedy avarice by him did ride upon a camel loaded all with gold two iron coffers hung on either side with precious mettle full as they might hold and in his lap and heap of coin he told for of his wicked pelf his god he made and unto hell him self for money sold accursed usury was all his trade and right and wrong alike in equal balance weighed his life was nigh unto death's door placed and threadbare coat and cobbled shoes he beware ne scarce good morsel all his life did taste but both from back and belly still did spare to fill his bags and richesse to compare yet child ne kinsman living had he none to leave them to but through daily care to get and nightly fear to loose his own he led a wretched life unto him self unknown most wretched wight whom nothing might suffice whose greedy lust did lack in greatest store whose need had end but no end covetise whose wealth was want whose plenty made him poor who had enough yet wished ever more a vile disease and eke in foot and hand a grievous gout tormented him full soar that well he could not touch nor go nor stand such one was avarice the fourth of this fair band and next to him malicious envy road upon a ravenous wolf and still did chaw between his cankered teeth a venomous toad that all the poison ran about his chaw but inwardly he chawed his own maw at neighbours wealth that made him ever sad for death it was when any good he saw and wept that cause of weeping none he had but when he herd of harm he waxed wondrous glad all in a kirtle of discoloured say he clothed was painted full of eyes and in his bosom secretly there lay and hateful snake the which his tail upties in many folds and mortal sting implies still as he road he gnashed his teeth to see those heaps of gold with gripple covetise and grudged at the great felicity of proud lucifera and his own company he hated all good works and virtuous deeds and him no less that any like did use and who with gracious bred the hungry feeds his alms for want of faith he does accuse so every good to bade he does abuse and eke the verse of famous poets wit he does backbite and spiteful poison spews from leprous mouth on all that ever writ such one vile envy was that first in row did sit and him beside rides fierce revenging vvrath upon a lion loath for to be led and in his hand a burning brand he hath the which he brandishes about his head his eyes did hurl forth sparkles fiery read and stared stern on all that him beheld as ashes pale of hew and seeming dead and on his dagger still his hand he held trembling through hasty rage when choler in him swelled his ruffian raiment all was stained with blood which he had spilled and all to rags rent through unadvised rashness waxed wood for of his hands he had no government ne cared for blood in his avengement but when the furious fit was overpassed his cruel facts he often would repent yet wilful man he never would forecast how many mischiefs should ensue his heedless haste full many mischiefs follow cruel vvrath abhorred bloodshed and tumultuous strife unmanly murder and unthrifty scathe bitter despite with rancour's rusty knife and fretting grief the enemy of life all these and many evils more haunt ire the swelling spleen and frenzy raging rife the shaking palsy and saint fraunces fire such one was vvrath the last of this ungodly tire and after all upon the wagon beam road sathan with a smarting whip in hand with which he forward lashed the lazy teem so oft as slowth still in the mire did stand huge routs of people did about them band shouting for joy and still before their way a foggy missed had covered all the land and underneath their feet all scattered lay dead skulls & bones of men whose life had gone astray so forth they marchen in this goodly sort to take the solace of the open air and in fresh flowering fields themselves to sport amongst the rest road that false lady fair the fowl duessa next unto the chair of proud lucifera as one of the train but that good knight would not so nigh repair him self estranging from their joyance vain whose fellowship seemed far unfit for warlike swain so having solaced themselves a space with pleasance of the breathing fields fed they back returned to the princely place whereas and errant knight in arms clad and heathenish shield wherein with letters read was writ sans joy they new arrived find inflamed with fury and fierce hardihood he seemed in heart to harbour thoughts unkind and nourish bloody vengeance in his bitter mind who when the shamed shield of slain sans foy he spied with that same fairy champions page bewraying him that did of late destroy his eldest brother burning all with rage he to him leapt and that same envious gage of victor's glory from him snatched away but the elfin knight which ought that warlike wage disdained to lose the meed he won in fray and him rencountering fierce rescued the noble prey therewith they gan to hurtlen greedily redoubted battle ready to deraign and clash their shields and shake their swords on high that with their stir they troubled all the train till that great queen upon eternal pain of high displeasure that ensuen might commanded them their fury to refrain and if that either to that shield had right in equal lists they should the morrow next it fight ah dearest dame quoth then the paynim bold pardon the error of enraged wight whom great grief made forget the reins to hold of reasons rule to see this recreant knight no knight but traitor full of false despite and shameful treason who through guile hath slain the prowest knight that ever field did fight even stout sans foy oh who can then refrain whose shield he bears reversed the more to heap disdain and to augment the glory of his guile his dearest love the fair fidessa lo is there possessed of the traitor vile who reaps the harvest sown by his foe sown in bloody field and bought with woe that brother's hand shall dearly well requite so be o queen you equal favour show him little answered th'angry elfin knight he never meant with words but swords to plead his right but threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge his cause in combat the next day to try so been they parted both with hearts on edge to be avenged each on his enemy that night they pass in joy and jollity feasting and courting both in bower and hall for steward was excessive gluttony that of his plenty poured forth to all which done the chamberlain slowth did to rest them call now whenas darksome night had all displayed her coalblack curtain over brightest sky the warlike youths on dainty couches laid did chase away sweet sleep from sluggish eye to muse on means of hoped victory but whenas morpheus had with leaden mace arrested all that courtly company uprose duessa from her resting place and to the painims lodging comes with silent pace whom broad awake she finds in troublous fit forecasting how his foe he might annoy and him moves with speeches seeming fit ah deer sans joy next dearest to sans foy cause of my new grief cause of new joy joyous to see his image in mine eye and grieved to think how foe did him destroy that was the flower of grace and chivalry lo his fidessa to thy secret faith i fly with gentle words he can her fairly greet and bad say on the secret of her heart then sighing soft i learn that little sweet oft tempered is quoth she with mush smart for since my breast was launched with lovely dart of deer sansfoy i never joyed hour

him he bore and ever since hath kept in darksome cave for that i would not yield that to sansfoy i gave but since fair sun hath dispersed that lowering cloud and to my loathed life now shows some light under your beams i will me safely shroud from dreaded storm of his disdainful spite to you th'inheritance belongs by right of brother's praise to you eke longs his love let not his love let not his restless spright be unrevenged that calls to you above from wandering stygian shores where it does endless move thereto said he fair dame be nought dismayed for sorrows past their grief is with

quoth he what odds can ever be where both do fight alike to win or yield yea but quoth she he bears a charmed shield and eke enchanted arms that none can pierce ne none can wound the man that does them wield charmed or enchanted answered he then fierce i no whit reck ne you the like need to rehearse but fair fidessa since fortune's guile or enemies pour hath now captived you return from whence

noble heart that harbours virtuous thought and is with child of glorious great intent can never rest until it forth have brought th'eternall brood of glory excellent such restless passion did all night torment the flaming courage of that fairy knight devizing how that doughty tournament with greatest honour he achieven might still did wake and still did watch for dawning light at last the golden oriental gate of greatest heaven gan to open fair and phoebus fresh as bridegroom to his mate came dancing forth shaking his dewy hair and hurls his glistering beams through gloomy air which when the wakeful elf perceived straight way he started up and did him self prepare in sun-bright arms and battailous array for with that pagan proud he combat will that day and forth he comes into the commune hall where early wait him many a gazing eye to weet what end to stranger knights may fallen there many minstrels maken melody to driven away the dull melancholy and many bards that to the trembling chord can tune their timely voices cunningly and many chroniclers that can record old loves and wars for ladies done by many a lord soon after comes the cruel sarazin in woven mail all armed warily and sternly looks at him who not a pin does care for look of living creatures eye they bring them wines of greece and araby and dainty spices fetched from furthest india to kindle heat of courage privily and in the wine a solemn oath they bind t'obserue the sacred laws of arms that are assigned at last forth comes that far renowned queen with royal pomp and princely majesty she is brought unto a paled green and placed under stately canopy the warlike feats of both those knights to see on th'other side in all men's open view duessa placed is and on a tree sansfoy his shield is hanged with bloody hew both those the laurel girlands to the victor due a shrilling trumpet sounded from on high and unto battle bade them selves address their shining shields about their wrists they tie and burning blades about their heads do bless the instruments of wrath and heaviness with greedy force each other does assail and strike so fiercely that they do impress deep dinted furrows in the battered mail the iron walls to ward their blows are weak & frail the sarazin was stout and wondrous strong and heaped blows like iron hammers great for after blood and vengeance he did long the knight was fierce and full of youthly heat and doubled strokes like dreaded thunders threat for all for praise and honour he did fight both stricken strike and beaten both do beatrice that from their shields forth flies firy light and helmets hewn deep show marks of either's might ▪ so th'one for wrong the other strives for right as when a gryfon seized of his prey a dragon fierce encounters in his flight through widest air making his idle way that would his rightful ravine rend away with hideous horror both together smite and souse so soar that they the heavens affray the wise soothsayer seeing so sad sighed amazed vulgar tells of wars and mortal fight so th'one for wrong the other strives for right and each to deadly shame would driven his foe the cruel steel so greedily does bite in tender flesh that streams of blood down flow with which the arms that erst so bright did show into a pure vermilion now are died great ruth in all the gazers hearts did grow seeing the gored wounds to gape so wide that victory they dare not wish to either side at last the paynim chanced to cast his eye his sudden eye flaming with wrathful fire upon his brother's shield which hung thereby therewith redoubled was his raging ire and said ah wretched son of woeful sire dost thou fit wailing by black stygian lake whilst here thy shield is hanged for victor's hire and sluggish germane dost thy forces slake to after-send his foe that him may overtake go caitiff elf him quickly overtake and soon redeem from his long wandering woe go guilty ghost to him my message make that i his shield have quit from dying foe therewith upon his crest he stroke him so that twice he reeled ready twice to fallen end of the doubtful battle deemed though the lookers on and loud to him gan call the false duessa thine the shield and i and all soon as the faery herd his lady speak out of his swooning dream he gan awake and quickening faith that erst was waxed weak the creeping deadly cold away did shake though moved with wrath and shame and ladies sake of all atonce he cast avenged to be and with exceeding fury at him strake that forced him to stoop upon his knee had he not stooped so he should have cloven be and to him said go now proud miscreant thy self thy message do to germane deer alone he wandering thee too long does want go say his foe thy shield with his does bear therewith his heavy hand he high gan rear him to have slain when lo a darksome cloud upon him fell he no where does appear but vanished is the elf him calls aloud but answer none receives the darkness him does shroud in haste duessa from her place arose and to him running said oh prowest knight that ever lady to her love did chosen let now abate the terror of your might and quench the flame of furious despite and bloody vengeance lo infernal powers covering your foe with cloud of deadly night have born him hence to plutoes baleful bowers the conquest yours i yours the shield and glory yours not all so satisfied with greedy eye he sought all round about his thirsty blade to both in blood of faithless enemy who all that while lay hid in secret shade he stands amazed how he thence should fade at last the trumpets triumph found on high and running heralds humble homage made greeting him goodly with new victory and to him brought the shield the cause of enmity wherewith he goes to that sovereign queen and falling her before on lowly knee to her makes present of his service seen which she accepts with thanks and goodly gree greatly advancing his gay chivalry so marches home and by her takes the knight whom all the people follow with great glee shouting and clapping all their hands on hight that all the air it fills and flies to heaven bright home is he brought and laid in sumptuous bed where many skilful leeches him abide to salve his hurts that yet still freshly bled in wine and oil they wash his wounds wide and softly can embalm on every side and all the while most heavenly melody about the bed sweet music did divide him to beguile of grief and agony and all the while duessa wept full bitterly as when a weary traveller that strays by muddy shore of broad seven-mouthed nile unweeting of the perilous wandering ways does meet a cruel crafty crocodile which in false grief hiding his harmful guile does weep full soar and sheds tender tears the foolish man that pities all this while his mournful plighted is swallowed up unwares forgetful of his own that minds another's cares so wept duessa until eventide that shining lamps in ioues high house were light then forth she rose ne longer would abide but comes unto the place where heathen knight in slumbering swoon nigh void of vital spright lay covered with enchanted cloud all day whom when she found as she him left in plighted to wail his woeful case she would not stay but to the eastern coast of heaven makes speedy way where grisly night with visage deadly sad that phoebus cheerful face durst never view and in a foul black pitchy mantle clad she finds forth coming from her darksome mew where she all day did hide her hated hew before the door her iron chariot stood already harnessed for journey new and coalblack steeds born of hellish brood that on their rusty bits did champ as they were wood who when she saw duessa sunny bright adorned with gold and jewels shining clear she greatly grew amazed at the sighed and unacquainted light began to fear for never did such brightness there appear and would have back retired to her cave until the witches speech she gan to hear saying yet o thou dreaded dame i crave abide till i have told the message which i have she stayed and forth duessa gan proceed oh thou most ancient grandmother of all more old then ioue whom thou at first didst breed or that great house of gods celestial which wast begotten in daemogorgons hall and sawest the secrets of the world unmade why sufferdst thou thy nephews deer to fallen with elfin sword most shamefully betrayed lo where the

are so fowl forlorn up then up dreary dame of darkness queen go gather up the relics of thy raze or else go them avenge and let be seen that dreaded night in brightest day hath place and can the children of fair light deface her feeling speeches some compassion moved in heart and change in that great mother's face yet pity in her heart was never proved till then and evermore she hated never loved and said dear daughter rightly may i rew the fallen of famous children born of me and good successes which their foes ensue but who can turn the stream of destiny or break the chain of strong necessity which fast is tied to ioues eternal seat the sons of day he favours i see and by my ruins thinks to make them great to make one great by others loss is bad excheat yet shall they not escape so freely all for some shall pay the price of others guilt and he the man that made sansfoy to fallen shall with his own blood price that he hath spilled but what art thou that tellest of nephews killed i that do seem not i duessa am quoth she how ever now in garments gilded and gorgeous gold arrayed i to thee came duessa i the daughter of deceit and shame then bowing down her aged back she kissed the wicked witch saying in that fair face the false resemblance of deceit i wist did closely lurk yet so true-seeming grace it carried that i scarce in darksome place could it discern though i the mother be of falsehood and root of duessaes raze o welcome child whom i have longed to see and now have seen unwares lo now i go with thee then to her iron wagon she betakes and with her bears the

she found the fairy knight departed thence albe his wounds wide not thoroughly healed unready were to ride good cause he had to hasten thence away for on a day his wary dwarf had spied where in a dungeon deep huge numbers lay of caitiff wretched thralls that wailed night and day a rueful sighed as could be seen with eye of whom he learned had in secret wise the hidden cause of their captivity how mortgaging their lives to covetise through wasteful pride and wanton riotise they were by law of that proud tyranness provoked with vvrath and envies false surmise condemned to that dungeon merciless where they should live in woe & die in wretchedness there was that great proud king of babylon that would compel all nations to adore and him as only god to call upon till through celestial doom thrown out of door into and ox he was transformed of yore there also was king craesus that enhanced his heart too high through his great riches store and proud antiochus the which advanced his cursed hand gainst god and on his altars danced and them long time before great nimrod was that first the world with sword and fire warrayed and after him old ninus far did pass in princely pomp of all the world obeyed there also was that mighty monarch laid low under all yet above all in pride that name of native sire did fowl upbraid and would as ammons son be magnified till scorned of god and man a shameful death he died all these together in one heap were thrown like carcases of beasts in butchers stall and in another corner wide were strown the antique ruins of the romans fallen great romulus the grandsire of them all proud tarquin and too lordly lentulus stout scipio and stubborn hanniball ambitious sylla and stern marius high caesar great pompey and fierce antonius among these mighty men were women mixed proud women vain forgetful of their yoke the bold semiramis whose sides transfixed with sons own blade her fowl reproaches spoke fair sthenoboea that her self did choke with wilful cord for wanting of her will high minded cleopatra that with stroke of asps sting her self did stoutly kill and thousands more the like that did that dungeon fill beside the endless routs of wretched thralls which thither were assembled day by day from all the world after their woeful falls through wicked pride and wasted wealths decay but most of all which in the dungeon lay fell from high princes courts or ladies bowers where they in idle pomp or wanton play consumed had their goods and thriftless hours and lastly thrown themselves into these heavy stours whose case when as the careful dwarf had told and made ensample of their mournful sighed unto his master he no longer would there dwell in peril of like painful plighted but early rose and ere that dawning light discovered had the world to heaven wide he by a privy postern took his flight that of no envious eyes he mote be spied for doubtless death ensued if any him descried scarce could he footing find in that fowl way for many corpses like a great lay-stall of murdered men which therein strowed lay without remorse or decent funeral which all through that great princess pride did fallen and came to shameful end and them beside forth riding underneath the castle wall a dunghill of dead carcases he spied the dreadful spectacle of that sad house of pride cant. vi from lawless lust by wondrous grace fair ʋna is released whom salvage nation does adore and learns her wise behest as when a ship that flies fair under sail and hidden rock escaped hath unwares that lay in wait her wrack for to bewail the mariner yet half amazed stares at peril past and yet it doubt ne dares to joy at his fool-happy oversight so doubly is distressed betwixt joy and cares the dreadless courage of this elfin knight having escaped so sad ensamples in his sighed yet sad he was that his too hasty speed the fair duess ' had forced him leave behind and yet more sad that vna his deer dread her truth had stained with treason so unkind yet crime in her could never creature find but for his love and for her own self sake she wandered had from one to other india him for to seek ne ever would forsake till her unwares the fierce sansloy did overtake who after archimagoes fowl defeat led her away into a forest wild and turning wrathful fire to lustful heat with beastly since thought her to have defiled and made the vassal of his pleasures vild yet first he cast by treaty and by trains her to persuade that stubborn fort to yield for greater conquest of hard love he gains that works it to his will then he that it constrains with fawning words he courted her a while and looking lovely and oft sighing soar her constant heart did tempt with diverse guile but words and looks and sighs she did abhor as rock of diamond steadfast evermore yet for to feed his firy lustful eye he snatched the veil that hung her face before then gan her beauty shine as brightest sky and burned his beastly heart efforce her chastity so when he saw his flattering arts to fail and subtle engines bet from battery with greedy force he gan the fort assail whereof he weened possessed soon to be and with rich spoil of ransacked chastity ah heavens that do this hideous act behold and heavenly virgin thus outraged see how can you vengeance just so long withhold and hurl not flashing flames upon that paynim bold the piteous maiden careful comfortless does throw out thrilling shrieks & shrieking cries the last vain help of women's great distress and with loud plaints importunes the skies that melted stars do drop like weeping eyes and phoebus flying so most shameful sighed his blushing face in foggy cloud implies and hides for shame what wit of mortal wight can now devise to quit a thrall from such a plighted eternal providence exceeding thought where none appears can make her self a way a wondrous way it for this lady wrought from lyons claws to pluck the gripped prey her shrill outcries and shrieks so loud did bray that all the woods and forests did resound a troop of fans and satires far away within the wood were dancing in a round while old syluanus slept in shady arbour sound who when they herd that piteous strained voice in haste forsook their rural merriment and ran towards the far rebounded noise to weet what wight so loudly did lament unto the place they come incontinent whom when the raging sarazin espied a rude mishapen monstrous rabblement whose like he never saw he durst not bide but god his ready steed and fast away gan ride the wild woodgods arrived in the place there find the virgin doleful desolate with ruffled raiments and fair blubbered face as her outrageous foe had left her late and trembling yet through fear of former hate all stand amazed at so uncouth sighed and gin to pity her unhappy state all stand astonished at her beauty bright in their rude eyes unworthy of so woeful plighted she more amazed in double dread does dwell and every tender part for fear does shake as when a greedy wolf through hunger fell a silly lamb far from the flock does take of whom he means his bloody feast to make a lion spies fast running towards him the innocent prey in haste he does forsake which quit from death yet quakes in every limb with change of fear to see the lion look so grim such fearful fit assayed her trembling heart ne word to speak ne joint to move she

semblance glad to comfort her and fear to put away their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obey the doubtful damosel dare not yet commit her single person to their barbarous truth but still betwixt fear and hope amazed does fit late learned what harm to hasty trust ensues they in compassion of her tender youth and wonder of her beauty sovereign are won with pity and unwonted ruth and all prostrate upon the lowly plain do kiss her feet and fawn on her with countenance feign their hearts she guesses by their humble guise and yields her to extremity of time so from the ground she fearless does arise and walks forth without suspect of crime they all as glad as birds of joyous prime thence led her forth about her dancing round shouting and singing all a shepherds rhyme and with green branches strowing all the ground do worship her as queen with olive garland crowned and all the way their merry pipes they found that all the woods with doubled echo ring and with their horned feet do wear the ground leaping like wanton kids in pleasant spring so towards old syluanus they her bring who with the noise awaked comes out to weet the cause his weak steps governing and aged limbs on cypress stadle stout and with and ivy twine his waste is girded about far off he wonders what them makes so glad of bacchus merry fruit they did invent or cybeles frantic rites have made them mad they drawing nigh unto their god present that flower of faith and beauty excellent the god himself viewing that mirror rare stood long amazed and burned in his intent his own fair dryope now he thinks not fair and pholoe fowl when her to this he does compare the woodborne people fallen before her flat and worship her as goddess of the wood and old syluanus self bethinks not what to think of wight so fair but gazing stood in doubt to deem her born of earthly brood sometime dame venus self he seems to see but venus never had so sober mood sometime diana he her takes to be but misses bow and shafts and buskin's to her knee by view of her he begins to revive his ancient love and dearest cyparisse and calls to mind his portraiture alive how fair he was and yet not fair to this and how he slew with glancing dart amiss a gentle hind the which the lovely boy did love as life above all worldly bliss for grief whereof the lad nould after joy but pined away in anguish and self-willed annoy the woody nymphs fair hamadryades her to behold do thither run apace and all the troop of lightfoot naiades flock all about to see her lovely face but when they viewed have her heavenly grace they envy her in their malicious mind and fly away for fear of fowl disgrace but all the satires scorn their woody kind and henceforth nothing fair but her on earth they find glad of such luck the luckless lucky maid did her content to please their feeble eyes and long time with that salvage people stayed to gather breath in many misery's during which time her gentle wit she plies to teach them truth which worshipped her in vain and made her th'image of idoiatryes but when their bootless zeal she did restrain from her own worship they her ass would worship fain it fortuned a noble warlike knight by just occasion to that forest came to seek his kindred and the lineage right from whence he took his well deserved name he had in arms abroad won mush same and filled far lands with glory of his might plain faithful true and enemy of shame and ever loved to fight for ladies right but in vain glorious frays he little did delight a satires son born in forest wild by strange adventure as it did betide and there begotten of a lady mild fair thyamis the daughter of labryde that was in sacred bans of wedlock tied to therion a lose unruly swain who had more joy to range the forest wide and chase the salvage beast with busy pain then serve his ladies love and wast in pleasures vain the forlorn maid did with loves longing burn and could not lack her lovers company but to the wood she goes to serve her turn and seek her spouse that from her still does fly and follows other game and venery a satire chanced her wandering for to find and kindling coals of lustin brutish eye the loyal links of wedlock did unbind and made her person thrall unto his beastly kind so long in secret cabin there he held her captive to his sensual desire till that with timely fruit her belly swelled and boar a boy unto that salvage fire then home he suffered her for to retire for ransom leaving him the late born child whom till to riper years he gan aspire he nursled up in life and manners wild amongst wild beasts and woods from laws of men exiled for all he taught the tender imp was but to banish cowardice and bastard fear his trembling hand he would him force to put upon the lion and the rugged bear and from the she bears teats her whelps to tear and eke wild roaring bulls he would him make to tame and ride their backs not made to bear and the roebucks in flight to overtake that every beast for fear of him did fly and quake thereby so fearless and so fell he grew that his own sire and master of his guise did often tremble at his horrid view and oft for dread of hurt would him advise the angry beasts not rashly to despise nor too much to provoke for he would learn the lion stoup to him in lowly wise a lesson hard and make the libbard stern leave roaring when in rage he for revenge did earn and for to make his pour approved more wild beasts in iron yokes he would compel the spotted panther and the tusked boar the pardal swift and the tiger cruel the antelope and wolf both fierce and fell and them constrain in equal teem to draw such joy he had their stubborn hearts to quell and sturdy courage tame with dreadful awe that his behest they feared as tyrants law his loving mother came upon a day unto the woods to see her little son and chanced unwares to meet him in the way after his sports and cruel pastime done when after him a lioness did run that roaring all with rage did loud require her children deer whom he away had won the lion whelps she saw how he did bear and lull in rugged arms withouten childish fear the fearful dame all quaked at the sighed and turning back gan fast to fly away until with love revoked from vain affright she hardly yet persuaded was to stay and then to him these womanish words gan say ah satyrane my darling and my joy for love of me leave off this dreadful play to dally thus with death is no fit toy go find some other play-fellows mine own sweet boy in these and like delights of bloody game he trained was till riper years he reached and there abided while any beast of name walked in that forest whom he had not taught to fear his force and then his courage haught desired of foreign foemen to be known and far abroad for strange adventures sought in which his might was never overthrown but through all fairy land his famous worth was blown yet evermore it was his manner fair after long labours and adventures spent unto those native woods for to repair to see his fire and offspring ancient and now he thither came for like intent where he unwares the fairest vna found strange lady in so strange habiliment teaching the satires which her sat around true sacred lore which from her sweet lips did redound he wondered at her wisdom heavenly rare whose like in women's wit he never knew and when her courteous deeds he did compare gan her admire and her sad sorrows rew blaming of fortune which such troubles threw and joyed to make proof of her cruelty on gentle dame so hurtless and so true thenceforth he kept her goodly company and learned her discipline of faith and verity but she all vowed unto the redcrosse knight his wandering peril closely did lament ne in this new acquaintance could delight but her deer heart with anguish did torment and all her wit in secret counsels spent how to escape at last in privy wise to satyrane she showed her intent who glad to gain such favour gan devise how with that pensive maid he best might thence arise so on a day when satires all were gone to do their service to syluanus old the gentle virgin left behind alone he led away with courage stout and bold too late it was to satires to be told or ever hope recover her again in vain he seeks that having cannot hold so fast he carried her with careful pain that they the woods are past & come now to the plain the better part now of the lingering day they traveled had when as they far espied a weary wight forwandering by the way and towards him they gan in haste to ride to weet of news that did abroad betide or tidings of her knight of the redcrosse but he them spying gan to turn aside for fear as seemed or for some feigned loss more greedy they of news fast towards him do cross a silly man in simple weeds forworn and soiled with dust of the long dried way his sandals were with toilsome travel torn and face all tanned with scorching sunny ray as he had traveled many a summers day through boiling sands of arabie and ynde and in his hand a iacobs staff to stay his weary limbs upon and eke behind his scrip did hang in which his needments he did bind the knight approaching nigh of him inquired tidings of war and of adventures new but wars nor new adventures none he heard then vna gan to ask if ought he knew or herd abroad of that her champion true that in his armour bore a crosslet read aye me dear dame quoth he well may i rew to tell the sad sighed which mine eyes have read these eyes did see that knight both living and eke dead that cruel word her tender heart so thrilled that sudden cold did run through every vain and stony horror all her senses filled with dying fit that down she fell for pain the knight her lightly reared up again and comforted with courteous kind relief then won from death she bade him tellen plain the further process of her hidden grief the lesser pangs can bear who hath endured the chief then gan the pilgrim thus i chanced this day this fatal day that shall i ever rew to see two knights in travel on my way a sorry fight arranged in battle new both breathing vengeance both of wrathful hew my fearful flesh did tremble at their strife to see their blades so greedily embrue that drunk with blood yet thirsted after life what more the redcrosse knight was slain with paynim knife ah dearest lord quoth she how might that be and he the stoutest knight that ever won ah dearest dame quoth he how might i see the thing that might not be and yet was done where is said satyrane that painims son that him of life and us of joy hath rest not far away quoth he he hence does won foreby a fountain where i late him left washing his bloody wounds that through the steel were cleft therewith the knight thence marched forth in haste while vna with huge heaviness oppressed could not for sorrow follow him so fast and soon he came as he the place had guessed whereas that pagan proud him self did rest in secret shadow by a fountain side even he it was that erst would have suppressed fair vna whom when satyrane espied with fowl reproachful words he boldly him defied and said arise thou cursed miscreant that hast with knightless guile and treacherous train fair knighthood foully shamed and dost vaunt that good knight of the redcrosse to have slave arise and with like treason now maintain thy guilty wrong or else thee guilty yield the saracen this hearing rose amain and catching up in haste his three square shield and shining helmet soon him buckled to the field and drawing nigh him said ah misborn elf in evil hour thy foes thee hither sent another's wrongs to wreak upon thy self yet ill thou blamest me for having blended my name with guile and traitorous intent that redcrosse knight perdy i never slew but had he been where erst his arms were lent th'enchaunter vain his error should not rew but thou his error shalt i hope now proved true therewith they gan both furious and fell to thunder blows and fiercely to assail each other bent his enemy to quell that with their force they pierced both plate and mail and made wide furrows in their fleshes frail that it would pity any living eye large floods of blood adown their sides did rail but floods of blood could not them satisfy both hungered after death both chosen to win or die so long they fight and fell revenge pursue that fainting each themselves to breathen let and oft refreshed battle oft renew as when two boars with rankling malice met their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret till breathless both them selves aside retire where foaming wrath their cruel tusks they whet and trample earth the while they may respire then back to fight again new breathed and entire so fiercely when these knights had breathed once they gan to fight return increasing more their puissant force and cruel rage atonce with heaped strokes more hugely then before that with their dreary wounds and bloody gore they both deformed scarcely could be known by this sad vna fraught with anguish soar led with their noise which through the air was thrown arrived where they in earth their fruitless blood had sown whom all so soon as that proud sarazin espied he gan revive the memory of his lewd lustest and late attempted since and left the doubtful battle hastily to catch her newly offered to his eye but satyrane with strokes him turning stayed and sternly bade him other business ply then hunt the steps of pure unspotted maid wherewith he all enraged these bitter speeches said o foolish fairies son what fury mad hath thee incensed to hast thy doleful feet were it not better i that lady had then that thou hadst repented it too late most senseless man he that himself does hate to love another lo then for thine aid here take thy lovers token on thy pate so they two fight the while the royal maid fled far away of that proud paynim soar afraid but that false pilgrim which that leasing told being in deed old archimage did stay in secret shadow all this to behold and much rejoiced in their bloody fray but when he saw the damsel pass away he left his stand and her pursued apace in hope to bring her to her last decay but for to tell her lamentable case and eke this battles end will need another place cant. vii the redcrosse knight is capture made by giant proud oppressed prince arthur meets with vna greatly with those news distressed what man so wise what earthly wit so aware as to descry the crafty cunning train by which deceit does mask in visor fair and cast her colours died deep in grain to seem like truth whose shape she well can feign and fitting gestures to her purpose frame the guiltless man with guile to entertain great mistress of her art was that false dame the false duessa cloaked with fidessaes name who when returning from the dreary night she found not in that perilous house of pride where she had left the noble redcrosse knight her hoped prey she would no longer bide but forth she went to seek him far and wide ere long she found whereas he weary sat to rest him self foreby a fountain side disarmed all of iron-coated plate and by his side his steed the grassy forage ate he seeds upon the cooling shade and bays his sweaty forehead in the breathing wind which through the trembling leaves full gently play wherein the cheerful birds of sundry kind do chant sweet music to delight his mind the witch approaching gan him fairly greet and with reproach of carelessness unkind upbraid for leaving her in place unmeet with fowl words tempering fair sour gall with honey sweet unkindness past they gan of solace treat and bathe in pleasance of the joyous shade which shielded them against the boiling heat and with green boughs decking a gloomy glade about the fountain like a garland made whose bubbling wave did ever freshly well ne ever would through fervent summer fade the sacred nymph which therein wont to dwell was out of dianes favour as it then befell the cause was this one day when phoebe fair with all her band was following the chase this nymph quite tired with heat of scorching air sat down to rest in midst of the raze the goddess wroth gan foully he disgrace and bade the waters which from her did flow be such as she her self was then in place thenceforth her waters waxed dull and slow and all that drunk thereof did faint and feeble grow hereof this gentle knight unweeting was and lying down upon the sandy grail drunk of the stream as clear as crystal glass eftsoons his manly forces gan to fail and mighty strong was turned to feeble frail his changed powers at first them selves not felt till curdled cold his courage gan assail and cheerful blood in faintness chill did melt which like a fever fit through all his body swelled yet goodly court he made still to his dame poured out in looseness on the grassy ground both careless of his health and of his fame till at the last he herd a dreadful sound which through the wood loud bellowing did rebound that all the earth for terror seemed to shake and trees did tremble th'elfe therewith astounded upstarted lightly from his looser make and his unready weapons gan in hand to take but ere he could his armour on him dight or get his shield his monstrous enemy with sturdy steps came stalking in his sighed and hideous giant horrible and high that with his tallness seemed to threat the sky the ground eke groaned under him for dread his living like saw never living eye ne durst behold his stature did exceed the hight of three the tallest sons of mortal seed the greatest earth his uncouth mother was and blustering aeolus his boasted sire who with his breath which through the world dot pass her hollow womb did secretly inspire and filled her hidden caves with stormy ire that she conceived and trebling the due time in which the wombs of women do expire brought forth this monstrous mass of earthly slime puffed up with empty wind and filled with sinful crime so grown great through arrogant delight of th'high descent whereof he was born and through presumption of his matchless might all other powers and knighthood he did scorn such now he marches to this man forlorn and left to loss his stalking steps are stayed upon a snaggy oak which he had torn out of his mother's bowels and it made his mortal mace wherewith his foemen he dismayed that when the knight he spied he gan advance with huge force and insupportable main and towards him with dreadful fury prance who hapless and eke hopeless all in vain did to him pace sad battle to deraign disarmed disgraced and inwardly dismayed and eke so faint in every joint and vain through that frail fountain which him feeble made that scarcely could he wield his bootless single blade the giant struck so mainly merciless that could have overthrown a stony tower and were not heavenly grace that him did bless he had been powdered all as thin as flower but he was wary of that deadly stour and lightly leapt from underneath the blow yet so exceeding was the villains pour that with the wind it did him overthrow and all his senses stound that still he lay full low as when that devilish iron engine wrought in deepest hell and framed by furies skill with windy nitre and quick sulphur fraught and rammed with bullet round ordained to kill conceiveth fire the heavens it does fill with thundering noise and all the air does choke that none can breath nor see nor hear at will through smouldery cloud of duskish stinking smoke that only breath him daunts who hath escaped the stroke so daunted when the giant saw the knight his heavy hand he heaved up on high and him to dust thought to have battered quite until duessa loud to him gan cry oh great orgoglio greatest under sky oh hold thy mortal hand for ladies sake hold for my sake and do him not to die but vanquished thine eternal bondslave make and me thy worthy meed unto thy leman take he hearkened and did stay from further harms to gain so goodly guerdon as she spoke so willingly she came into his arms who her as willingly to grace did take and was possessed of his new found make then up he took the slumbered senseless corpse and ere he could out of his swown awake him to his castle brought with hasty force and in a dungeon deep him threw without remorse from that day forth duessa was his deer and highly honoured in his haughty eye he gave her gold and purple pall to wear and triple crown set on her head full high and her endowed with royal majesty then for to make her dreaded more of men and peoples hearts with awful terror tie a monstrous beast bred in filthy fen he chosen which he had kept long time in darksome den such one it was as that renowned snake which great alcides in stremona slew long fostered in the filth of lerna lake whose many heads out budding ever new did breed him endless labour to subdue but this same monster much more ugly was for seuen great heads out of his body grew and iron breast and back of scaly brass and all imbrued in blood his eyes did shine as glass his tail was stretched out in wondrous length that to the house of heavenly gods it reached and with extorted pour and borrowed strength the ever-burning lamps from thence it brought and proudly threw to ground as things of nought and underneath his filthy feet did tread the sacred things and holy hests foretaught upon this dreadful beast with seuenfoldhead he set the false duessa for more awe and dread the woeful dwarf which saw his masters fallen while he had keeping of his grazing steed and valiant knight become a caitiff thrall when all was passed took up his forlorn weed his mighty armour missing most at need his silver shield now idle masterless his poignant spear that many made to bleed the rueful monuments of heaviness and with them all departes to tell his great distress he had not travailed long when on the way he woeful lady woeful vna met fast flying from the painims greedy prey whilst satyrane him from pursuit did let who when her eyes she on the dwarf had set and saw the signs that deadly tidings spoke she fell to ground for sorrowful regret and lively breath her sad breast did forsake yet might her piteous heart be seen to pant and quake the messenger of so unhappy news would feign have died dead was his heart within yet outwardly some little comfort shows at last recovering heart he does begin to rub her temples and to chause her chin and every tender part does toss and turn so hardly he the flitted life does win unto her native prison to return then begins her grieved ghost thus to lament and mourn the dreary instruments of doleful sighed that do this deadly spectacle behold why do you longer feed on loathed light or liking find to gaze on earthly mould sith cruel fates the careful threads unfold the which my life and love together tied now let the stony dart of senseless cold perce to my heart and pass through every side and let eternal night so sad sighed from me hide o lightsome day the lamp of highest ioue first made by him men's wandering ways to guide when darkness he in deepest dungeon drove henceforth thy hated face for ever hide and shut up heavens windows shining wide for earthly sighed can nought but sorrow breed and late repentance which shall long abide mine eyes no more on vanity shall feed but seeled up with death shall have their deadly meed then down again she fell unto the ground but he her quickly reared up again thrice did she sink adown in deadly swoon and thrice he her revived with busy pain at last when life recovered had the rain and over-wrestled his strong enemy with faltering tonge and trembling every vain tell on quoth she the woeful tragedy the which these relics sad present unto mine eye tempestuous fortune hath spent all her spite and thrilling sorrow thrown his utmost dart thy sad tongue cannot tell more heavy plighted then that i feel and harbour in mine heart who hath endured the whole can bear each part if death it be it is not the first wound that launched hath my breast with bleeding smart begin and end the bitter baleful stound if less then that i fear more favour i have found then gan the dwarf the whole discourse declare the subtle trains of archimago old the wanton loves of false fidessa fair bought with the blood of vanquished paynim bold the wretched pair transformed to treen mould the house of pride and perils round about the combat which he with sansioy did hold the luckless conflict with the giant stout wherein captived of life or death he stood in doubt she herd with patience all unto the end and strove to master sorrowful assay which greater grew the more she did contend and almost rend her tender heart in tway and love fresh coals unto her fire did lay for greater love the greater is the loss was never lady loved dearer day then she did love the knight of the redcrosse for whose deer sake so many troubles her did toss at last when fervent sorrow slaked was she up arose resolving him to find a live or dead and forward forth does pass all as the dwarf the way to her assigned and evermore in constant care full mind she fed her wound with fresh renewed bale long tossed with storms and bet with bitter wind high over hills and low adown the dale she wandered many a wood and measured many a vale at last she chanced by good hap to meet a goodly knight fair marching by the way together with his squire arrayed meet his glitterand armour shined far away like glancing light of phoebus brightest ray from top to toe no place appeared bore that deadly dint of steel endanger may athwart his breast a baldric brave he beware that shined like twinkling stars with stones most precious rare and in the midst thereof one precious stone of wondrous worth and eke of wondrous mights shaped like a ladies head exceeding shone like hesperus amongst the lesser lights and strove for to amaze the weaker sights thereby his mortal blade full comely hung in ivory sheath carved with curious slights whose hilts were burnished gold and handle strong of mother pearl and buckled with a golden tonge his haughty helmet horrid all with gold both glorious brightness and great terror bred for all the crest a dragon did enfold with greedy paws and over all did spread his golden wings his dreadful hideous head close couched on the beaver seemed to throw from flaming mouth bright sparkles fiery read that sudden horror to faint hearts did show and scaly tail was stretched adown his back full low upon the top of all his lofty crest a bunch of hairs discoloured diversely with sprinkled pearl and gold full richly dressed did shake and seemed to dance for jollity like to and almond tree mounted high on top of green selinis all alone with blossoms brave bedecked daintily whose tender locks do tremble every one at every little breath that under heaven is blown his warlike shield all closely covered was ne might of mortal eye be ever seen not made of steel nor of enduring brass such earthlymettals soon consumed be but all of diamond perfect pure and clean it framed was one massy entire mould hewn out of adamant rock with engines keen that point of spear it never pierce could ne dint of direful sword divide the substance would the same to wight he never wont disclose but when as monsters huge he would dismay or daunt unequal armies of his foes or when the flying heavens he would affray for so exceeding shone his glistering ray that phoebus golden face it did attaint as when a cloud his beams does overlay and silver cynthia waxed pale and faint as when her face is stained with magic arts constraint no magic arts hereof had any might nor bloody words of bold enchanters call but all that was not such as seemed in sighed before that shield did fade and sudden fallen and when him list the rascal routs appall men into stones therewith he could transmew and stones to dust and dust to nought at all and when him list the prouder looks subdue he would them gazing blind or turn to other hew ne let it seem that credence this exceeds for he that made the same was known right well to have done much more admirable deeds it merlin was which whilom did excel all living wights in might of magic spell both shield and sword and armour all he wrought for this young prince when first to arms he fell but when he died the faery queen it brought to faery land where yet it may be seen if sought a gentle youth his dearly loved squire his spear of ebony wood behind him bore whose harmful head thrice heated in the fire had riven many a breast with pikehead square a goodly person and could manage fair his stubborn steed with curbed canon bit who under him did trample as the air and chafed that any on his back should fit the iron rowels into frothy some he bit when as this knight nigh to the lady drew with lovely court he gan her entertain but when he herd her answers loath he knew some secret sorrow did her heart distrain which to allay and calm her storming pain fair feeling words he wisely gan display and for her humour fitting purpose feign to tempt the cause it self for to bewray wherewith immoved these bleeding words she gan to say what world's delight or joy of lining speech can heart so plunged in sea of sorrows deep and heaped with so huge misfortunes reach the careful cold begins for to creep and in my heart his iron arrow steep soon as i think upon my bitter bale such helpless harms its better hidden keep then rip up grief where it may not avail my last left comfort is my woes to weep and wail ah lady deer quoth then the gentle knight well may i ween your grief is wondrous great for wondrous great grief groans in my spright while thus i hear you of your sorrows treat but woeful lady let me you entreat for to unfold the anguish of your heart mishaps are mastered by advice discrete and counsel mitigates the greatest smart found never help who never would his hurts impart o but quoth she great grief will not be told and can more easily be thought then said right so quoth he but he that never would could never will to might gives greatest aid but grief quoth she does greater grow displayed if then it find not help and breeds despair despair breeds not quoth he where faith is stayed no faith so fast quoth she but flesh does pair flesh may impair quoth he but reason can repair his goodly reason and well guided speech so deep did settle in her gracious thought that her persuaded to disclose the breach which love and fortune in her heart had wrought and said fair sir i hope good hap hath brought you to inquire the secrets of my grief or that your wisdom will direct my thought or that your prowess can me yield relief then hear the story sad which i shall tell you brief the forlorn maiden whom your eyes have seen the laughing stock of fortune's mockeries am only daughter of a king and queen whose parents deer whilst equal destinies did run about and their felicities the favourable heavens did not envy did spread their rule through all the territories which phison and euphrates flows by and gebons golden waves do wash continually at last by subtle sleights she him betrayed unto his foe a giant huge and tall who him disarmed dissolute dismayed unwares surprised and with mighty mall the monster merciless him made to fallen whose fallen did never foe before behold and now in darksome dungeon wretched thrall remediless for aye he does him hold this is my cause of grief more great then may be told ere she had ended all she gan to faint but he her comforted and fair bespoke certes madame you have great cause of plaint that stoutest heart i ween could cause to quake but be of cheer and comfort to you take for till i have acquit your captive knight assure your self i will you not forsake his cheerful words revived her cheerless spright so forth they went the dwarf them guiding ever right cant. viii fair virgin to redeem her deer brings arthur to the fight who slays that giant wounds the beast and strips duessa quite ay me how many perils do enfold the righteous man to make him daily fallen were not that heavenly grace does him uphold and steadfast truth acquit him out of all her love is firm her care continual so oft as he through his own foolish pride or weakness is to sinful bans made thrall else should this redcrosse knight in bans have died for whose deliverance she this prince does thither guide they sadly traveled thus until they came nigh to a castle built strong and high then cried the dwarf lo yonder is the same in which my lord my liege does luckless lie thrall to that giants hateful tyranny therefore deer sir your mighty powers assay the noble knight alighted by and by from lofty steed and bade the lady stay to see what end of fight should him befall that day so with the squire th'admirer of his might he marched forth towards that castle wall whose gates he found fast shut ne lining wight to ward the same nor answer comers call then took that squire and home of bugle small which hung adown his side in twisted gold and tassels gay wide wonders over all of that same horns great virtues weren told which had approved be in uses manifold was never wight that herd that shrilling found but trembling fear did feel in every vain three miles it might be easy herd around and echoes three answered it self again no false enchantment nor deceitful train might once abide the terror of that blast but presently was void and wholly vain no gate so strong no lock so firm and fast but with that piercing noise flew open quite or braced the same before the giants gate he blew that all the castle quaked from the ground and every door of freewill open flew the giant self dismayed with that sound where he with his duessa dalliance found in haste came rushing forth from inner bower with staring countenance stern as one astounded and staggering steps to weet what sudden stour had wrought that horror strange and dared his dreaded pour and after him the proud duessa came high mounted on her many headed beast and every head with firy tongue did flame and every head was crowned on his crest and bloody mouthed with late cruel feast that when the knight beheld his mighty shield upon his manly arm he soon addressed and at him fiercely flew with courage filled and eager greediness through every member thrilled therewith the giant buckled him to fight inflamed with scornful wrath and high disdain and lifting up his dreadful club on hight all armed with ragged snubs and knotty grain him thought at first encounter to have slain but wise and wary was that noble peer and lightly leaping from so monstrous main did fair avoid the violence him never it booted nought to think such thunderbolts to bear ne shame he thought to shun so hideous might the idle stroke enforcing furious way missing the mark of his misaimed sighed did fallen to ground and with his heavy sway so deeply dinted in the driven clay that three yards deep a furrow up did throw the sad earth wounded with so soar assay did groan full grievous underneath the blow and trembling with strange fear did like and earthquake show as when almighty love in wrathful mood to wreak the guilt of mortal sins is bent hurls forth his thundering dart with deadly food enrolled in flames and smouldering dreariment through riven clouds and melted firmament the fierce threeforked engine making way both lofty towers and highest trees hath rend and all that might his angry passage stay and shooting in the earth casts up a mount of clay his boisterous club so buried in the ground he could not rearen up again so light but that the knight him at advantage found and while he strove his cumbered club to quite out of the earth with blade all burning bright he smote off his left arm which like a block did fallen to ground deprived of native might large streams of blood out of the trunked stock forth gushed like fresh water stream from riven rock dismayed with so desperate deadly wound and eke impatient of unwonted pain he loudly brayed with beastly yelling found that all the fields rebellowed again as great a noise as when in cymbrian plain and herd of bulls whom kindly rage does sting do for the milky mother's want complain and fill the fields with troublous bellowing the neighbour woods around with hollow murmuring that when his deer duessa herd and saw the evil stound that dangered her estate unto his aid she hastily did draw her dreadful beast who swollen with blood of late came ramping forth with proud presumptuous gate and threatened all his heads like flaming brands but him the squire made quickly to retreat encountering fierce with single sword in hand and betwixt him and his lord did like a bulwark stand the proud duessa full of wrathful spite and fierce disdain to be affronted so inforced her purple beast with all her might that stop out of the way to overthrow scorning the let of so unequal foe but nathemore would that courageous swain to her yield passage gainst his lord to go but with outrageous strokes did him restrain and with his body barred the way atwixt them twaine then took the angry witch her golden cup which still she boar replete with magic arts death and despair did many thereof sup and secret poison through their inner parts th'eternall bale of heavy wounded hearts which after charms and some enchantments said she lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts therewith his sturdy courage soon was quayed and all his senses were with sudden dread dismayed so down he fell before the cruel beast who on his neck his bloody claws did seize that life night crushed out of his panting breast no pour he had to stir nor will to rise that when the careful knight gan well avise he lightly left the foe with whom he fought and to the beast gan turn his enterprise for wondrous anguish in his heart it wrought to see his loved squire into such thraldom brought and high advancing his bloodthirsty blade stroke one of those deformed heads so soar that of his puissance proud ensample made his monstrous scalp down to his teeth it tore and that misformed shape mishap more a sea of blood gushed from the gaping wound that her gay garments stained with filthy gore and overflowed all the field around that over shoes in blood he waded on the ground thereat he roared for exceeding pain that to have herd great horror would have bred and scourging empty air with his long train through great impatience of his grieved head his gorgeous rider from her lofty stead would have cast down and trod in dirty mire had not the giant soon her succoured who all enraged with smart and frantic ire came hurtling in full fierce and forced the knight retire the force which wont in two to be dispersed in one alone left hand he now unites which is through rage more strong then both were erst with which his hideous club aloft he dites and at his foe with furious rigour smites that strongest oak might seem to overthrow the stroke upon his shield so heavy lights that to the ground it doubles him full low what mortal wight could ever bear so monstrous blow and in his fallen his shield that covered was did lose his veil by chance and open flew the light whereof that heavens light did pass such blazing brightness through the air threw that eye mote not the same endure to view which when the giant spied with staring eye he down let fallen his arm and soft withdrew his weapon huge that heaved was on high for to have slain the man that on the ground did lie and eke the fruitful-headed beast amazed at flashing beams of that sunshiny shield became stark blind and all his senses dazed that down he tumbled on the dirty field and seemed himself as conquered to yield whom when his mistress proud perceived to fallen while yet his feeble feet for faintness reeled unto the giant loudly she gan call oh help orgoglio help or else we perish all at her so piteous cry was much moved her champion stout and for to aid his friend again his wonted angry weapon proved but all in vain for he has read his end in that bright shield and all their forces spend themselves in vain for since that glancing sighed he hath no pour to hurt nor to defend as where th'almighties lightning brand does light it dims the dazed eyes and daunts the senses quite whom when the prince to battle new addressed and threatening high his dreadful stroke did see his sparkling blade about his head he blessed and smote off quite his right leg by the knee that down he tumbled as and aged tree high growing on the top of rocky clift whose heartstrings with keen steel nigh hewn be the mighty trunk half rend with ragged rift does roll adown the rocks and fallen with fearful drift or as a castle reared high and round by subtle engines and malicious slight is undermined from the lowest ground and her foundation forced and feebled quite at last down falls and with her heaped hight her hasty ruin does more heavy make and yields it self unto the victor's might such was this giants fallen that seemed to shake the steadfast globe of earth as it for fear did quake the knight then lightly leaping to the prey with mortal steel him smote again so soar that headless his unwieldy body lay all wallowed in his own fowl bloody gore which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store but soon as breath out of his breast did pass that huge great body which the giant boar was vanished quite and of that monstrous mass was nothing left but like and empty bladder was whose grievous fallen when false duessa spied her golden cup she cast unto the ground and crowned mitre rudely threw aside such piercing grief her stubborn heart did wound that she could not endure that doleful stound but leaving all behind her fled away the lightfoot squire her quickly turned around and by hard means enforcing her to stay oh brought unto his lord as his deserved prey the royal virgin which beheld from far in pensive plighted and sad perplexity the whole achievement of this doubtful war came running fast to greet his victory with sober gladness and mild modesty and with sweet joyous cheer him thus bespoke fair branch of noblesse flower of chivalry that with your worth the world amazed make how shall i quite the pains you suffer for my sake and you fresh bud of virtue springing fast whom these sad eyes saw nigh unto death's door what hath poor virgin for such peril past wherewith you to reward accept therefore my simple self and service evermore and he that high does fit and all things see with equal eyes their merits to restore behold what you this day have done for me and what i cannot quite requite with usury but sith the heavens and your fair handling have made you master of the field this day your fortune master eke with governing and well begun end all so well i pray ne let that wicked woman escape away for she it is that did my lord bethrall my dearest lord and deep in dungeon lay where he his better days hath wasted all o hear how piteous he to you for aid does call forthwith he gave in charge unto his squire that scarlet whore to keepen carefully while he himself with greedy great desire into the castle entered forcibly where living creature none he did espy then gan he loudly through the house to call but no man cared to answer to his cry there reigned a solemn silence over all nor voice was herd nor wight was seen in bower or hall at last with creeping crooked pace forth came and old old man with beard as white as snow that on a staff his feeble steps did frame and guide his weary gate both too and from for his eye sighed him failed long xx and on his arm a bunch of keys he boar the which unused rust did overgrow those were the keys of every inner door but he could not them use but kept them still in store but very uncouth sighed was to behold how he did fashion his untoward pace for as he forward moved his footing old so backward still was turned his wrinkled face unlike to men who ever as they trace both feet and face one way are wont to led this was the ancient keeper of that place and foster father of the giant dead his name ignaro did his nature right aread his reverend hairs and holy gravity the knight much honoured as beseemed well and gently asked where all the people be which in that stately building wont to dwell who answered him full soft he could not tell again he asked where that same knight was laid whom great orgoglio with his puissance fell had made his caitiff thrall again he said e could not tell ne ever other answer made then asked he which way he in might pass he could not tell again he answered thereat the courteous knight displeased was and said old sire it seems thou hast not read how ill it fits with that same silver head in vain to mock or mocked in vain to be but if thou be as thou art portrayed with nature's pen in ages graven degree aread in graver wise what i demand of thee his answer likewise was he could not tell whose senseless speech and doted ignorance when as the noble prince had marked well he guessed his nature by his countenance and calmed his wrath with goodly temperance then to him stepping from his arm did reach those keys and made himself free entrance each door he opened without any breach there was no bar to stop nor foe him to impeach there all within full rich arrayed he found with royal arras and resplendent gold and did with store of every thing abound that greatest princes presence might behold but all the floor too filthy to be told with blood of guiltless babes and innocents true which there were slain as sheep out of the fold defiled was that dreadful was to view and sacred ashes over it was strowed new and there beside of marble stone was built and altar carved with cunning imagery on which true christians blood was often spilled and holy martyrs often done to die with cruel malice and strong tyranny whose blessed sprites from underneath the stone to god for vengeance cried continually and with great grief were often herd to groan that hardest heart would bleed to hear their piteous moan through every room he sought and every bower but no where could he find that woeful thrall at last he came unto and iron door that fast was locked but key found not at all amongst that bunch to open it withal but in the same a little grate was pight through which he sent his voice and loud did call with all his pour to weet if living wight were housed there within whom he enlargen might herewith and hollow dreary murmuring voice these piteous plaints and dolours did resound oh who is that which brings me happy choice of death that here lie dying every stound yet live perforce in baleful darkness bound for now three moons have changed thrice their hew and have been thrice hid underneath the ground since i the heavens

with constant zeal and courage bold after long pains and labours manifold he found the means that prisoner up to rear whose feeble thighs unable to uphold his pined corpse him scarce to light could bear a rueful spectacle of death and ghastly drear his sad dull eyes deep sunk in hollow pits could not endure unwonted sun to view his bore thin cheeks for want of better bits and empty sides deceived of their due could make a stony heart his hap to rew his rawbone arms whose mighty brawned bowers were wont to rive steel plataeae helmets hew were clean consumed and all his vital powers decayed and all his flesh shrunk up like withered flowers whom when his lady saw to him she ran with hasty joy to see him made her glad and sad to view his visage pale and wan who erst in flowers of freshest youth was clad tho when her well of tears she wasted had she said ah dearest lord what evil star on you hath frowned and poured his influence bad that of your self you thus berobbed are and

altogether bald and as in hate of honourable eld was overgrown with scurf and filthy scald her teeth out of her rotten gums were felled and her sour breath abominably smelled her dried dugs like bladders lacking wind hung down and filthy matter from them wielded her wrizzled skin as rough as maple rind so scabby was that would have loathed all womankind her nether parts the shame of all her

at leisure dwell but forward fare as their adventures fell but ere they parted vna fair besought that stranger knight his name and nation tell lest so great good as he for her had wrought should die unknown & buried be in thankless thought fair virgin said the prince you me require a thing without the compass of my wit for both the lineage and the certain sire from which i sprung from me are hidden yet for all so soon as life did me admit into this world and showed heavens light from mother's pap i taken was unfit and straight delivered to a fairy knight to be upbrought in gentle thews and martial might unto old timon he me brought by live old timon who in youthly years hath been in warlike feats th'expertest man alive and is the wisest now on earth i ween his dwelling is low in a valley green under the foot of rauran mossy hoar from whence the river dee as silver clean his tumbling billows rolls with gentle roar there all my days he trained me up in virtuous lore thither the great magicien merlin came as was his use ofttimes to visit me for he had charge my discipline to frame and tutors nourriture to oversee him oft and oft i asked in privity of what loins and what

laugh at me and favour mine intent forwearied with my sports i did alight from lofty steed and down to sleep me laid the verdant grass my couch did goodly dight and pillow was my helmet fair displayed while every sense the humour sweet embayed and slumbering soft my heart did steal away me seemed by my side a royal maid her dainty limbs full softly down did lay so fair a creature yet saw never sunny day most goodly glee and lovely blandishment she to me made and bade me love her deer for dearly sure her love was to me bent as when just time expired should appear but whither dreams delude or

gold and gorgeous ornament wherein were closed few drops of liquour pure of wondrous worth and virtue excellent that any wound could heal incontinent which to requite the redcrosse knight him gave a book wherein his saviour's testament was writ with golden letters rich and brave a work of wondrous grace and able souls to save thus been they parted arthur on his way to seek his love and th'other for to fight with vnaes foe that all her realm did pray but she now weighing the decayed plighted and shrunken sinews of her chosen knight would not a while her forward course pursue ne bring him forth in face of dreadful fight till he recovered had his former hew for him to be yet weak and weary well she knew so as they traveled lo they gan espy and armed knight towards them gallop fast that seemed from some feared foe to fly or other grisly thing that him aghast still as he fled his eye was backward cast as if his fear still followed him behind also flew his steed as he his bans had braced and with his winged heals did tread the wind as he had been a sole of pegasus his kind nigh as he drew they might perceive his head to be unarmed and curled uncombed hears upstaring stiff dismayed with uncouth dread nor drop of blood in all his face appears nor life in limb and to increase his fears in fowl reproach of knighthood's fair degree about his neck and hempen rope he wears that with his glistering arms does ill agree but he of rope or arms has now no memory the redcrosse knight towards him crossed fast to weet what mister wight was so dismayed there him he finds all senseless and aghast that of him self he seemed to be afraid whom hardly he from flying forward stayed till he these words to him deliver might sir knight aread who hath you thus arrayed and eke from whom make you this hasty flight for never knight i saw in such misseeming plighted he answered nought at all but adding new fear to his first amazement staring wide with stony eyes and heartless hollow hew astonished stood as one that had espied infernal furies with their chains untied him yet again and yet again bespoke the gentle knight who nought to him replied but trembling every joint did inly quake and faltering tongue at last these words seemed forth to shake for gods deer love sir knight do me not stay for lo he comes he comes fast after me eft looking back would feign have run away but he him forced to stay and tellen free the secret cause of his perplexity yet nathemore by his bold hearty speech could his blood-frozen heart emboldened be but through his boldness rather fear did reach yet forced at last he made through silence sudden breach and am i now in safety sure quoth he from him that would have forced me to die and is the point of death now turned from me that i may tell this hapless history fear nought quoth he no danger now is nigh then shall i you recount a rueful case said he the which with this unlucky eye i late beheld and had not greater grace me reft from it had be partaker of the place i lately chanced would i had never chanced with a fair knight to keepen company sir terwin hight that well himself advanced in all affairs and was both bold and free but not so happy as mote happy be he loved as was his lot a lady gent that him again loved in the least degree for she was proud and of too high intent and joyed to see her lover languish and lament from whom returning sad and comfortless as on the way together we did fare we met that villain god from him me bless that cursed wight from whom i escaped whilere a man of hell that calls himself despair who first us greets and after fair areads of tidings strange and of adventures rare so creeping close as snake in hidden weeds inquires of our states and of our knightly deeds which when he knew and felt our feeble hearts embossed with bale and bitter biting grief which love had launched with his deadly darts with wounding words and terms of foul reprieve he plucked from us all hope of due relief that erst us held in love of lingering life then hopeless heartless gan the cunning thief persuade us die to stint all further strife to me he lent this rope to him a rusty knife with which sad instrument of hasty death that woeful lover loathing longer light a wide way made to let forth living breath but i more fearful or more lucky wight dismayed with that deformed dismal sighed fled fast away half dead with dying fear ne yet assured of life by you sir knight whose like infirmity like chance may bear but god you never let his charmed speeches hear how may a man said he with idle speech be won to spoil the castle of his health i wot quoth he whom trial late did teach that like would not for all this world's wealth his subtle tongue like dropping honey melts into the heart and searches every vain that ere one be aware by secret stealth his pour is rest and weakness does remain o never sir desire to try his guileful train certes said he hence shall i never rest till i that treacherous art have herd and tried and you sir knight whose name mote i request of grace do me unto his cabin guide i that hight treuisan quoth he will ride against my liking back to do you grace but nor for gold nor glee will i abide by you when you arrive in that same place for lever had i die then see his deadly face ere long they come where that same wicked wight his dwelling has low in and hollow cave far underneath a craggy clift pight dark doleful dreary like a greedy graven that still for carrion carcases does crave on top whereof aye dwelled the ghastly owl shrieking his baleful note which ever drove far from that haunt all other cheerful fowl and all about it wandering ghosts did wail and howl and all about old stocks and stubs of trees whereon nor fruit nor leaf was ever seen did hang upon the ragged rocky knees on which had many wretches hanged been whose carcases were scattered on the green and thrown about the cliffs arrived there that barehead knight for dread and doleful teen would feign have fled ne durst approachen near but th'other forced him stay and comforted in fear that darksome cave they enter where they find that cursed man low sitting on the ground musing full sadly in his sulle in mind his greasy locks long grown and unbound disordered hung about his shoulders round and hid his face through which his hollow eyes look deadly dull and stared as astounded his rawbone cheeks through penury and pine where shrunk into his jaws as he did never dine his garment nought but many ragged clouts with thorns together pined and patched was the which his naked sides he wrapped about and him beside there lay upon the grass a dreary corpse whose life away did pass all wallowed in his own yet lukewarm blood that from his wound yet welled fresh alas in which a rusty knife fast fixed stood and made and open passage for the gushing flood which piteous spectacle approving true the woeful tale that treuisan had told when as the gentle redcrosse knight did view with firy zeal he burned in courage bold him to avenge before his blood were cold and to the villain said thou damned wight the author of this fact we here behold what justice can but judge against thee right with thine own blood to price his blood here shed in sighed what frantic fit quoth he hath thus distracted thee foolish man so rash a doom to give what justice ever other judgement taught but he should die who merits not to live none else to death this man despairing driven but his own guilty mind deserving death is then unjust to each his due to give or let him die that loathes liniug breath or let him die at ease that lives here uneath who travels by the weary wandering way to come unto his wished home in haste and meets a flood that does his passage stay is not great grace to help him over past or free his feet that in the mire stick fast most envious man that grieves at neighbours good and found that joyest in the woe thou hast why wilt not let him pass that long hath stood upon the bank yet wilt thy self not pass the flood he there does now enjoy eternal rest and happy ease which thou dost want and crave and further from it daily wanderest what if some little pain the passage have that makes frail flesh to fear the bitter wave is not short pain well born that brings long ease and lays the soul to sleep in quiet graven sleep after toil port after stormy seas ease after war death after life does greatly please the knight much wondered at his sudden wit and said the term of life is limited ne may a man prolong nor shorten it the soldier may not move from watchful stead nor leave his stand until his captain bed who life did limit by almighty doom quoth he knows best the terms established and he that points the centonell his room does license him depart at found of morning droom is not his deed what ever thing is done in heaven and earth did not he all create to die again all ends that was begun their times in his eternal book of fate are written sure and have their certain date who then can strive with strong necessity that holds the world in his still changing state or shun the death ordained by destiny when hour of death is come let none ask whence nor why the longer life i wot the greater since the greater since the greater punishment all those great battles which thou boasts to win through strife and bloodshed and avengement now praised hereafter deer thou shalt repent for life must life and blood must blood repay is not enough thy evil life forespent for he that once hath missed the right way the further he does go the further he does stray then do no further go no further stray but here lie down and to thy rest betake th'ill to prevent that life ensuen may for what hath life that may it loved make and gives not rather cause it to forsake fear sickness age loss labour sorrow strife pain hunger cold that makes the heart to quake and ever fickle fortune rages rife all which and thousands more do make a loathsome life thou wretched man of death hast greatest need if in true balance thou wilt weigh thy state for never knight that dared warlike deed more luckless disadventures did amate witness the dungeon deep wherein of late thy life shut up for death so oft did call and though good luck prolonged hath thy date yet death then would the like mishaps forestall into the which hereafter thou mayest happen fallen why then dost thou o man of since desire to draw thy days forth to their last degree is not the measure of thy sinful hire high heaped up with huge iniquity against the day of wrath to burden thee is not enough that to this lady mild thou falsed hast thy faith with perjury and sold thy self to serve duessa vild with whom in all abuse thou hast thy self defiled is not he just that all this does behold from highest heaven and bears and equal eye shall he thy sins up in his knowledge fold and guilty be of thine impiety is not his law let every sinner die die shall all flesh what then must needs be done is it not better to do willingly then linger till the glass be all out run death is the end of woes die soon oh fairies son the knight was much enmoved with his speech that as a swords point through his heart did pierce and in his conscience made a secret breach well knowing true all that he did rehearse and to his fresh remembrance did reverse the ugly view of his deformed crimes that all his manly powers it did disperse as he were charmed with enchanted rhymes that oftentimes he quaked and fainted oftentimes in which amazement when the miscreant perceived him to waver weak and frail while trembling horror did his conscience daunt and hellish anguish did his soul assail to driven him to despair and quite to quail he showed him painted in a table plain the damned ghosts that do in torments wail and thousand fiends that do them endless pain with fire and brimstone which for ever shall remain the sighed whereof so thoroughly him dismayed that nought but death before his eyes he saw and ever burning wrath before him laid by righteous sentence of th'almighties law then gan the villain him to overcraw and brought unto him swords ropes poison fire and all that might him to perdition draw and bade him choose what death he would desire for death was due to him that had provoked gods ire but when as none of them he saw him take he to him reached a dagger sharp and keen and gave it him in hand his hand did quake and tremble like a leaf of aspen green and troubled blood through his pale face was seen to come and go with tidings from the heart as it a running messenger had been at last resolved to work his final smart he listed up his hand that back again did start which when as vna saw through every vain the curdled cold ran to her well of life as in a swown but soon relived again out of his hand she snatched the cursed knife and threw it to the ground enraged rife and to him said fie fie faint hearted knight what meanest thou by this reproachful strife is this the battle which thou vauntest to fight with that fire-mouthed dragon horrible and bright come come away frail silly fleshly wight ne let vain words bewitch thy manly heart ne devilish thoughts dismay thy constant spright in heavenly mercies hast thou not a part why shouldst thou then despair that chosen art where justice grows there grows eke greater grace ▪ the which does quench the brand of hellish smart and that accursed handwriting does deface arise sir knight arise and leave this cursed place so up he rose and thence amounted straight which when the carl beheld and saw his guest would safe depart for all his subtle sleight he chosen and halter from among the rest and with it hung himself unbid unblest but death he could not work himself thereby for thousand times he so himself had dressed yet natheless it could not do him die till he should die his last that is eternally cant. x. her faithful knight fair ʋna brings to house of holiness where he is taught repentance and the way to heavenly bless what man is he that boasts of fleshly might and vain assurance of mortality which all so soon as it does come to fight against spiritual foes yields by and by or from the field most cowardly does fly ne let the man ascribe it to his skill that through grace hath gained victory if any strength we have it is to ill but all the good is gods both power and eke will by that which lately happened vna saw that this her knight was feeble and too faint and all his sinews waxed weak and raw through long imprisonment and hard constraint which he endured in his late restraint that yet he was unfit for bloody fight therefore to cherish him with diets daint she cast to bring him where he cheeren might till he recovered had his late decayed plighted there was and ancient house not far away renowned throughout the world for sacred lore and pure unspotted life so well they say it governed was and guided evermore through wisdom of a matron graven and hoar whose only joy was to relieve the needs of wretched souls and help the helpless poor all night she spent in bidding of her beds and all the day in doing good and godly deeds dame caelia men did her call as thought from heaven to come or thither to arise the mother of three daughters well upbrought in goodly thews and godly exercise the eldest two most sober chaste and wise fidelia and speranza virgins were though spoused yet wanting wedlock's solemnize but fair charissa to a lovely fere was linked and by him had many pledges dear arrived there the door they find fast locked for it was warily watched night and day for fear of many foes but when they knocked the porter opened unto them straight way he was and aged sire all hoary grey with looks full lowly cast and gate full slow wont on a staff his feeble steps to stay hight humilta they pass in stooping low for straight & narrow was the way which he did show each goodly thing is hardest to begin but entered in a spacious court they see both plain and pleasant to be walked in where them does meet a franklin fair and free and entertains with comely courteous glee his name was zeal that him right well became for in his speeches and behaviour he did labour lively to express the same and gladly did them guide till to the hall they came there fairly them receives a gentle squire of mild demeanour and rare courtesy right cleanly clad in comely sad attire in word and deed that showed great modesty and knew his good to all of each degree hight reverence he them with speeches meet does fair entreat no courting nicety but simple true and eke unfeigned sweet as might become a squire so great persons to greet and afterwards them to his dame he leads that aged dame the lady of the place who all this while was busy at her beads which done she up arose with seemly grace and towards them full matronly did pace where when that fairest vna she beheld whom well she knew to spring from heavenly raze her heart with joy unwonted inly swelled as feeling wondrous comfort in her weaker eld and her embracing said o happic earth whereon thy innocent feet do ever tread most virtuous virgin born of heavenly berth that to redeem thy woeful parents head from tyrants rage and ever-dying dread hast wandered through the world now long a day yet ceasest not thy weary soles to led what grace hath thee now hither brought this way or done thy feeble feet unweeting hither stray strange thing it is and errant knight to see here in this place or any other wight that hither turns his steps so few there be that chosen the narrow path or seek the right all keep the broad high way and take delight with many rather for to go astray and be partakers of their evil plighted then with a few to walk the rightest way oh foolish men why haste you to your own decay thy self to see and tired limbs to rest oh matron sage quoth she i hither came and this good knight his way with me addressed led with thy praises and broad-blazed fame that up to heaven is blown the ancient dame him goodly greeted in her modest guise and entertained them both as best became with all the courtesies that she could devise ne wanted ought to show her bounteous or wise thus as they gan of sundry things devise lo two most goodly virgins came in place linked arm in arm in lovely wise with countenance demure and modest grace they numbered even steps and equal pace of which the eldest that fidelia hight like sunny beams threw from her crystal face that could have dazed the rash beholders sighed and round about her head did shine like heavens light she was arrayed all in lily white and in her right hand boar a cup of gold with wine and water filled up to the hight in which a serpent did himself enfold that horror made to all that did behold but she no whit did change her constant mood and in her other hand she fast did hold a book that was both signed and sealed with blood wherein dark things were writ hard to be understood her younger sister that speranza hight was clad in blue that her beseemed well not all so cheerful seemed she of sighed as was her sister whither dread did dwell or anguish in her heart is hard to tell upon her arm a silver anchor lay whereon she leaned ever as befell and ever up to heaven as she did pray her steadfast eyes were bent ne swerved other way they seeing vna towards her gan weened who them encounters with like courtesy many kind speeches they between them spend and greatly joy each other well to see then to the knight with shamefast modesty they turn themselves at vnaes meek request and him salute with well beseeming glee who fair them quites as him beseemed best and goodly gan discourse of many a noble gest then vna thus but she your sister deer the deer charissa where is she become or wants she health or busy is elsewhere ah no said they but forth she may not come for she of late is lightened of her womb and hath increased the world with one son more that her to see should be but troublesome indeed quoth she that should be trouble soar but thanked be god and her increase so evermore then said the aged coelia dear dame and you good sir i wot that of your toil and labours long through which you hither came you both forwearied be therefore a while i read you rest and to your bowers recoil then called she a groom that forth him led into a goodly lodge and gan despoil of puissant arms and laid in easy bed his name was meek obedience rightfully aread now when their weary limbs with kindly rest and bodies were refreshed with due repast fair vna gan fidelia fair request to have her knight into her schoolhouse placed that of her heavenly learning he might taste and hear the wisdom of her words divine she granted and that knight so much graced that she him taught celestial discipline and opened his dull eyes that light mote in them shine and that her sacred book with bloody writ that none could read except she did them teach she unto him disclosed every whit and heavenly documents thereout did preach that weaker wit of man could never reach of god of grace of justice of free will that wonder was to hear her goodly speech for she was able with her words to kill and raise again to life the heart that she did thrill and when she list pour out her larger spright she would command the hasty sun to stay or backward turn his course from heavens hight sometime great hosts of men she could dismay and eke huge mountains from their native seat she would command themselves to bear away and throw in raging sea with roaring threat almighty god her gave such pour and puissance great the faithful knight now grew in little space by hearing her and by her sisters lore to such perfection of all heavenly grace that wretched world he gan for to abhor and mortal life gan loath as thing forlore grieved with remembrance of his wicked ways and pricked with anguish of his sins so soar that he desired to end his wretched days so much the dart of sinful guilt the soul dismays but wise speranza gave him comfort sweet and taught him how to take assured hold upon her silver anchor as was meet else had his sins so great and manifold made him forget all that fidelia told in this distressed doubtful agony when him his dearest vna did behold disdaining life desiring leave to die she found her self assailed with great perplexity and came to coelia to declare her smart who well acquainted with that commune plighted which sinful horror works in wounded heart her wisely comforted all that she might with goodly counsel and advisement right and straightway sent with careful diligence to fetch a leach the which had great insight in that disease of grieved conscience and well could cure the same his name was patience who coming to that soul-diseased knight could hardly him entreat to tell his grief which known and all that annoyed his heavy spright well searched eftsoons he gan apply relief of salves and medicines which had passing proof and thereto added words of wondrous might by which to ease he him recured brief and much assuaged the passion of his plighted that he his pain endured as seeming now more light but yet the cause and root of all his ill inward corruption and infected since not purged nor healed behind remained still and festering soar did rankle yet within close creeping betwixt the marrow and the skin which to extirp he laid him privily down in a darksome lowly place far in whereas he meant his corrosives to apply and with straight diet tame his stubborn malady in ashes and sackcloth he did array his dainty corpse proud humours to abate and dieted with fasting every day the swelling of his wounds to mitigate and made him pray both early and eke late and ever as superfluous flesh did rot amendment ready still at hand did wait to pluck it out with pincers firy hot that soon in him was left no one corrupted jot and bitter penance with and iron whip was wont him once to disple every day and sharp remorse his heart did prick and nip that drops of blood thence like a well did play and sad repentance used to embay his body in salt water smarting soar the filthy blots of sin to wash away so in short space they did to health restore the man that would not live but erst lay at deaths door which his torment often was so great that like a lion he would cry and roar and rend his flesh and his own sinews eat his own deer vna hearing evermore his rueful shrieks and groanings often tore her guiltless garments and her golden hear for pity of his pain and anguish soar yet all with patience wisely she did bear or well she wist his crime could else be never clear whom thus recovered by wise patience and true repentance they to vna brought who joyous of his cured conscience him dearly kissed and fairly eke besought himself to cherish and consuming thought to put away out of his careful breast by this charissa late in childbed brought was waxed strong and left her fruitful nest to her fair vna brought this unacquainted guest he was a woman in her freshest age of wondrous beauty and of bounty rare with goodly grace and comely personage that was on earth not easy to compare full of great love but cupids wanton snare as hell she hated chaste in work and will her neck and breasts were ever open bore that ay thereof her babes might suck their fill the rest was all in yellow robes arrayed still a multitude of babes about her hung playing their sports that joyed her to behold whom still she fed while they were weak & young but thrust them forth still as they waxed old and on her head she wore a tyre of gold adorned with gems and ouches wondrous fair whose passing price uneath was to be told and by her side there sat a gentle pair of turtle doves she sitting in and ivory chair the knight and vna entering fair her greet and bid her joy of that her happy brood who them requites with courtesies seeming meet and entertains with friendly cheerful mood then vna her besought to be so good as in her virtuous rules to school her knight now after all his torment well withstood in that sad house of penance where his spright had passed the pains of hell and long enduring night she was right joyous of her just request and taking by the hand that fairies son gan him instruct in every good behest of love and righteousness and well to done and wrath and hatred warily to shun that drew on men gods hatred and his wrath and many souls in dolours had fordone in which when him she well instructed hath from thence to heaven she teaches him the ready path wherein his weaker wandering steps to guide and ancient matron she to her does call whose sober looks her wisdom well descried her name was mercy well known over all to be both gracious and eke liberal to whom the careful charge of him she gave to led aright that he should never fallen in all his ways through this wide world's wave that mercy in the end his righteous soul might save the godly matron by the hand him bears forth from her presence by a narrow way scattered with bushy thorns and ragged briers which still before him she removed away that nothing might his ready passage stay and ever when his feet encumbered were organ to shrink or from the right to stray she held him fast and firmly did upbear as careful nurse her child from falling oft does rear eftsoones unto and holy hospital that was before by the way she did him bring in which seuen beadmen that had vowed all their life to service of high heavens king did spend their days in doing godly thing there gates to all were open evermore that by the weary way were traveling and one sat waiting ever them before to call incomers by that needy were and poor the first of them that eldest was and best of all the house had charge and government as guardian and steward of the rest his office was to give entertainment and lodging unto all that came and went not unto such as could him feast again and double quite for that he on them spent but such as want of harbour did constrain those for gods sake his duty was to entertain the second was as almner of the place his office was the hungry for to feed and thirsty give to drink a work of grace he feared not once him self to be in need ne cared to hoard for those whom he did breed the grace of god he laid up still in store which as a stock he left unto his seed he had enough what need him care for more and had he less yet some he would give to the poor the third had of their wardrobe custody in which were not rich tires nor garments gay the plumes of pride and wings of vanity but clothes meet to keep keen could away and naked nature seemly to array with which bore wretched wights he daily clad the images of god in earthly clay and if that no spare clothes to give he had his own coat he would cut and it distribute glad the fourth appointed by his office was poor prisoners to relieve with gracious aid and captives to redeem with price of brass from turkes and sarazins which them had stayed and though they faulty were yet well he weighed that god to us forgives every hour much more then that why they in bans were laid and he that harrowed hell with heavy stour the faulty souls from thence brought to his heavenly bower the fift had charge sick persons to attend and comfort those in point of death which lay for them most needs comfort in the end when since and hell and death do most dismay the feeble soul departing hence away all is but lost that living we bestow if not well ended at our dying day o man have mind of that last bitter throw for as the tree does fallen so lies it ever low the sixt had charge of them now being dead in seemly sort their corpses to engrave and deck with dainty flowers their bridal bed that to their heavenly spouse both sweet and brave they might appear when he their souls shall save the wondrous workmanship of gods own mould whose face he made all beasts to fear and gave all in his hand even dead we honour should ah dearest god me grant i dead be not defouled the seuenth now after death and burial done had charge the tender orphans of the dead and widows aid lest they should be undone in face of judgement he their right would plead ne ought the pour of mighty men did dread in their defence nor would for gold or fee be won their rightful causes down to tread and when they stood in most necessity he did supply their want and gave them ever free there when the elfin knight arrived was the first and chiefest of the seuen whose care was guests to welcome towards him did pass where seeing mercy that his steps up bore and always led to her with reverence rare he humbly louted in meek lowliness and seemly welcome for her did prepare for of their order she was patroness albe charissa were their chiefest founderess there she awhile him stays him self to rest that to the rest more able he might be during which time in every good behest and godly work of alms and charity she him instructed with great industry shortly therein so perfect he became that from the first unto the last degree his mortal life he learned had to frame in holy righteousness without rebuke or blame thence forward by that painful way they pass forth to and hill that was both steep and high on top whereof a sacred chapel was and eke a little hermitage thereby wherein and aged holy man did lie that day and night said his devotion ne other worldly business did apply his name was heavenly contemplation of god and goodness was his meditation great grace that old man to him given had for god he often saw from heavens hight all were his earthly eyes both blunt and bad and through great age had lost their kindly sighed yet wondrous quick and perceant was his spright as eagles eye that can behold the sun that hill they scale with all their pour and might that his frail thighs nigh weary and fordone gan fail but by her help the top at last he won there they do find that godly aged sire with snowy locks adown his shoulders shed as hoary frost with spangle's does attire the mossy branches of and oak half dead each bone might through his body well be read and every sinew seen through his long fast for nought he cared his carcase long unfed his mind was full of spiritual repast and pined his flesh to keep his body low and chaste who when these two approaching he espied at their first presence grew aggrieved soar that forced him lay his heavenly thoughts aside and had he not that dame respected more whom highly he did reverence and adore he would not once have moved for the knight they him saluted standing far afore who well them greeting humbly did requite and asked to what end they climbed that tedious height what end quoth he should cause us take such pain but that same end which every living wight should make his mark high heaven to attain is not from hence the way that leads right to that most glorious house that glisters bright with burning stars and everliving fire whereof the keys are to thy hand behight by wise fidelia she does thee require to show it to this knight according his desire thrice happy man said then the father graven whose staggering steps thy steady hand does led and shows the way his sinful soul to save who better can the way to heaven aread then thou thy self that was both born and bred in heavenly throne where thousand angels shine thou dost the prayers of the righteous seed present before the majesty divine and his avenging wrath to clemency incline yet since thou bidst thy pleasure shall done then come

first thou must a season fast and pray till from her bans the spright assoiled is and have her strength recured from frail infirmities that done he leads him to the highest mount such one as that same mighty man of god that blood-red billows like a walled front on either side disparted with his rod till that his army dryfoot through them yode dwelled fortie days upon where writ in stone with bloody letters by the hand of god the bitter doom of death and baleful moan he did receive while flashing fire about him shone or like that sacred hill whose head full high adorned with fruitful olives all around is as it were for endless memory of that deer lord who oft thereon was found for ever with a flowering garland crowned or like that pleasant mount that is for ay through famous poets verse each where renowned on which the thrice three learned ladies play their heavenly notes and make full many a lovely lay from thence far off he unto him did show a little path that was both steep and long which to a goodly city led his view whose walls and towers were built high and strong of pearl and precious stone that earthly tonge cannot describe nor wit of man can tell too high a ditty for my simple song the city of the great king hight it well wherein eternal peace and happiness does dwell as he thereon stood gazing he might see the blessed angels to and from descend from highest heaven in gladsome company and with great joy into that city weened as commonly as friend does with his friend whereathe wondered much and gan inquire what stately building durst so high extend her lofty towers unto the starry sphere and what unknown nation there impeopled were fair knight quoth he hierusalem that is the new hierusalem that god has built for those to dwell in that are chosen his his chosen people purged from sinful guilt with piteous blood which cruelly was spilled on cursed tree of that unspotted lamb that for the sins of all the world was killed now are they saints all in that city same more deer unto their god then younglings to their dam till now said then the knight i weened well that great cleopolis where i have been in which that fairest faery queen does dwell the fairest city was that might be seen and that bright tower all built of crystal clean panthea seemed the brightest thing that was but now by proof all otherwise i ween for this great city that does far surpass and this bright angels tower quite dims that tower of glass most true then said the holy aged man yet is cleopolis for earthly fame the fairest piece that eye beholden can and well beseems all knights of noble name that covet in th'immortall book of fame to be eternized that same to haunt and done their service to that sovereign dame that glory does to them for guerdon grant for she is heavenly born and heaven may justly vaunt and thou fair imp sprung out from english raze how ever now accounted elsins son well worthy dost thy service for her grace to aid a virgin desolate fordone

to the ground to have returned but dazed were his eyes through passing brightness which did quite confoun his feeble sense and too exceeding shine so dark are earthly things compared to things divine at last whenas himself he gan to find to vna back he cast him to retire who him awaited still with pensive mind great thanks and goodly meed to that good sire he thence departing gave for his pains

to repair whereto whenas they now approached near with hearty words her knight she gan to cheer and in her modest manner thus bespoke dear knight as deer as ever knight was deer that all these sorrows suffer for my sake high heaven behold the tedious toil you for me take now are we come unto my native soil and to the place where all our perils dwell here haunts that fiend and does his daily spoil therefore henceforth be at your keeping well and ever ready for your foeman fell the spark of noble courage now awake and strive your excellent self to excel that shall you evermore renowned make above all knights on earth that battle undertake and pointing forth lo yonder is said she the brazen tower in which my parents deer for dread of that huge fiend imprisoned be whom i from far see on the walls appear whose sighed my feeble soul does greatly cheer and on the top of all i do espy the watchman waiting tidings glad to hear that o my parents might i happily unto you bring to ease you of your misery with that they herd a roaring hideous found that all the air with terror filled wide and seemed uneath to shake the steadfast ground eftsoones that dreadful dragon they espied where stretch he lay upon the sunny side of a great hill himself like a great hill but all so soon as he from far descried those glistering arms that heaven with light did fill he roused himself full blithe and hastened them until then bad the knight this lady yede aloof and to and hill her self with draw aside from whence she might behold that battle's proof and eke be safe from danger far descried she him obeyed and turned a little wide now oh thou sacred muse most learned dame fair imp of phoebus and his aged bride the nurse of time and everlasting fame that warlike hands ennoblest with immortal name oh gently come into my feeble breast come gently but not with that mighty rage wherewith the martial troops thou dost infest and hearts of great heroes dost enrage that nought their kindled courage may assuage soon as thy dreadful trump begins to sound the god of war with his fierce equipage thou dost awake sleep never he so sound and feared nations dost with horror stern astounded fair goddess lay that furious fit aside till i of wars and bloody mars do sing and briton fields with sarazin blood bedyed betwixt that great fairy queen and paynim king that with their horror heaven and earth did ring a work of labour long and endless praise but now a while let down that haughty string and to my tunes thy second tenor raise that i this man of god his godly arms may blaze by this the dreadful beast drew nigh to hand half flying and half footing in his haste that with his largeness measured much land and made wide shadow under his huge waste as mountain does the valley overcast approaching nigh he reared high afore his body monstrous horrible and wast which to increase his wondrous greatness more was swollen with wrath & poison & with bloody gore and over all with brazen scales was armed like plated coat of steel so couched near that nought mote pierce ne might his corpse be harmed with dint of sword nor push of pointed spear which as and eagle seeing prey appear his aery plumes does rouse full rudely dight so shaked he that horror was to hear for as the clashing of and armour bright such noise his roused scales did send unto the knight his flaggy wings when forth he did display were like two sails in which the hollow wind is gathered full and works speedy way and eke the pens that did his pinions bind were like mainyards with flying canvas lined with which whenas him list the air to beatrice and there by force unwonted passage find the clouds before him fled for terror great and all the heavens stood still amazed with his threat his huge long tail wound up in hundred folds does overspread his long brass-scaly back whose wreathed boughts when ever he unfolds and thick entangled knots down does slack bespotted all with shields of read and black it sweeps all the land behind him far and of three furlongs does but little lack and at the point two stings infixed are both deadly sharp that sharpest steel exceeden far but stings and sharpest steel did far exceed the sharpness of his cruel rending claws dead was it sure as sure as death in deed what ever thing does touch his ravenous paws or what within his reach he ever draws but his most hideous head my tongue to tell does tremble for his deep devouring jaws wide gaped like the grisly mouth of hell through which into his dark abyss all ravine fell and that more wondrous was in either jaw three ranks of iron teeth enranged were in which yet trickling blood and gobbets raw of late devoured bodies did appear that sighed thereof bred cold congealed fear which to increase and all atonce to kill a cloud of smothering smoke and sulphur sear out of his stinking gorge forth esteemed still that all the air about with smoke and stench did fill his blazing eyes like two bright shining shields did burn with wrath and sparkled living fire as two broad beacons set in open fields send forth their flames far off to every shire and warning give that enemies conspire with fire and sword the region to invade so flamed his eyes with rage and rancorous ire but far within as in a hollow glade those glaring lamps were set that made a dreadful shade so dreadfully he towards him did pass forelifting up aloft his speckled breast and often bounding on the bruised grass as for great joyance of his newcome guest eftsoones he gan advance his haughty crest as chafed boar his bristles does uprear and shook his scales to battle ready dressed that made the redcrosse knight nigh quake for fear as bidding bold defiance to his foeman near the knight gan fairly couch his steady spear and fiercely ran at him with rigorous might the pointed steel arriving rudely there his harder hide would neither pierce nor bite but glancing by forth passed forward right yet soar moved with so puissant push the wrathful beast about him turned light and him so rudely passing by did brush with his long tail that horse and man to ground did rush both horse and man up lightly rose again and fresh encounter towards him addressed but idle stroke yet back recoiled in vain and found no place his deadly point to rest exceeding rage inflamed the furious beast to be avenged of so great despite for never felt his impierceable breast so wondrous force from hand of living wight yet had he proved the pour of many a puissant knight then with his waving wings displayed wide himself up high he lifted from the ground and with strong flight did forcibly divide the yielding air which nigh too feeble found her flitting parts and element unfound to bear so great a weight he cutting way with his broad sails about him soared round at last low stooping with unwieldy sway snatched up both horse & man to bear them quite away long he them boar above the subject plain so far as ewghen bow a shaft may send till struggling strong did him at last constrain to let them down before his flight's end as haggard hawk presuming to contend with hardy fowl above his able might his weary pounces all in vain does spend to truss the pray too heavy for his flight which coming down to ground does free it self by fight he so disseized of his groping gross the knight his thrillant spear again assayed in his brass-plated body to embossed and three men's strength unto the stroke he laid wherewith the stiff beam quaked as afraid and glancing from his scaly neck did glide close under his left wing then broad displayed the piercing steel there wrought a woundfull wide that with the uncouth smart the monster loudly cried he cried as raging seas are wont to roar when wintery storm his wrathful wreck does threat the rolling billows beatrice the ragged shore as they the earth would shoulder from her seat and greedy gulf does gape as he would eat his neighbour element in his revenge then gin the blustering brothers boldly threat to move the world from off his steadfast hinge and boisterous battle make each other to avenge the steely head stuck fast still in his flesh till with his cruel claws he snatched the wood and quite a sunder broke forth flowed fresh a gushing river of black gory blood that drowned all the land whereon he stood the stream thereof would driven a water-mill trebly augmented was his furious mood with bitter sense of his deep rooted ill that flames of fire he threw forth from his large nosethrill his hideous tail then hurled he about and therewith all enwrapped the nimble thighs of his froth-fomy steed whose courage stout striving to lose the knot that fast him ties himself in straighter bands too rash implies that to the ground he is perforce constrained to throw his rider who can quickly rise from off the earth with dirty blood distained for that reproachful fallen right foully he disdained and fiercely took his trench and blade in hand with which he stroke so furious and so fell that nothing seemed the puissance could withstand upon his crest the hardened iron fell but his more hardened crest was armed so well that deeper dint therein it would not make yet so extremely did the buff him quell that from thenceforth he shunned the like to take but when he saw them come he did them still forsake the knight was wrath to see his stroke beguiled and smote again with more outrageous might but back again the sparkling steel recoiled and left not any mark where it did light as if in adamant rock it had be pight the beast impatient of his smarting wound and of so fierce and forcible despite thought with his wings to stye above the ground but his late wounded wing unserviceable found then full of grief and anguish vehement he loudly brayed that like was never herd and from his wide devouring oven sent a flake of fire that flashing in his beard him all amazed and almost made afeard the scorching flame soar swinged all his face and through his armour all his body seared that he could not endure so cruel case but thought his arms to leave and helmet to unlace not that great champion of the antique world whom famous poets verse so much does daunt and hath for twelue huge labours high extolled so many furies and sharp fits did haunt when him the poisoned garment did enchant with centaur's blood and bloody verses charmed as did this knight twelue thousand dolours daunt whom firy steel now burned that erst him armed that erst him goodly armed now most of all him harmed faint weary soar emboiled grieved brent with heat toil wounds arms smart & inward fire that never man such mischiefs did torment death better were death did he oft desire but death will never come when needs require whom so dismayed when that his foe beheld he cast to suffer him no more respire but gan his sturdy stern about to wielded and him so strongly stroke that to the ground him felled it fortuned as fair it then befell behind his back unweeting where he stood of ancient time there was a springing well from which fast trickled forth a silver flood full of great virtues and for medicine good whilom before that cursed dragon god that happy land and all with innocent blood defiled those sacred waves it rightly hight the well of life ne yet his virtues had forgotten for unto life the dead it could restore and guilt of sinful crimes clean wash away those that with sickness were infected soar it could recure and aged long decay renew as it were born that very day both silo this and iordan did excel and th'english bath and eke the germane spau ne can cephise nor hebrus match this well into the same the knight back overthrown fell now gan the golden phoebus for to steep his fiery face in billows of the west and his faint steeds watered in ocean deep while from their journal labours they did rest when that infernal monster having cast his weary foe into that living well can high advance his broad discoloured breast above his wonted pitch with countenance fell and clapped his iron wings as victor he did dwell which when his penfiue lady saw from far great woe and sorrow did her soul assay as weening that the sad end of the war and gan to highest god entirely pray that feared chance from her to turn away with folded hands and knees full lowly bent all night she watched ne once adown would lay her dainty limbs in her sad dreariment but praying still did wake and waking did lament the morrow next gan early to appear that titan rose to run his daily raze but early ere the morrow next gan rear out of the sea fair titans dewy face up rose the gentle virgin from her place and looked all about if she might spy her loved knight to move his manly pace for she had great doubt of his safety since late she saw him fallen before his enemy at last she saw where he upstarted brave out of the well wherein he drenched lay as eagle fresh out of the ocean wave where he hath left his plumes all hoary grey and decked himself with feathers youthly gay like eyas hawk up mounts unto the skies his newly budded pinions to assay and marvels at himself still as he flies so new this newborn knight to battle new did rise whom when the damned fiend so fresh did spy no wonder if he wondered at the sighed and doubted whither his late enemy it were or other new supplied knight he now to prove his late renewed might high brandishing his bright deaw-burning blade upon his crested scalp so soar did smite that to the scull a yawning wound it made the deadly dint his dulled senses all dismayed i wot not whither the revenging steel were hardened with that holy water due wherein he fell or sharper edge did feel or his baptised hands now greater grew or other secret virtue did ensue else never could the force of fleshly arm ne melted mettle in his blood embrew for till that stound could never wight him harm by subtlety nor slight nor might nor mighty charm the cruel wound enraged him so soar that loud he yielded for exceeding pain as hundred ramping lyons seemed to roar whom ravenous hunger did thereto constrain then gan he toss aloft his stretched train and therewith scourge the buxom air so soar that to his force to yielden it was feign ne ought his sturdy strokes might stand afore that high trees overthrew and rocks in pieces tore the same advancing high above his head with sharp intended sting so rude him smote that to the earth him drove as stricken dead ne living wight would have him life behight the mortal sting his angry needle shot quite through his shield and in his shoulder seized where fast it stuck ne would there out be god the grief thereof him wondrous soar diseased ne might his rankling pain with patience be appeased but yet more mindful of his honour deer then of the grievous smart which him did wring from loathed soil he can him lightly rear and strove to lose the far infixed string which when in vain he tried with struggling inflamed with wrath his raging blade he heaved and struck so strongly that the knotty sting of his huge tail he quite a sunder cleft fiue joints thereof he hewed and but the stump him left heart cannot think what outrage and what cries with foul enfouldered smoke and flashing fire the hellbred beast threw forth unto the skies that all was covered with darkness dire then fraught with rancour and engorged ire he cast at once him to avenge for all and gathering up himself out of the mire with his uneven wings did fiercely fallen upon his sun-bright shield and gripped it fast withal much was the man encumbered with his hold in fear to loose his weapon in his paw ne wist yet how his talons to unfold for harder was from cerberus greedy jaw to pluck a bone then from his cruel claw to reave by strength the gripped gage away thrice he assayed it from his foot to draw and thrice in vain to draw it did assay it booted nought to think to rob him of his prey tho when he saw no power might prevail his trusty sword he called to his last aid wherewith he fiercely did his foe assail and double blows about him stoutly laid that glancing fire out of the iron played as sparkles from the anvil use to fly when heavy hammers on the wedge are swayed therewith at last he forced him to untie one of his grasping feet him to defend thereby the other foot fast fixed on his shield whenas no strength nor strokes mote him constrain to lose ne yet the warlike pledge to yield he smote thereat with all his might and main that nought so wondrous puissance might sustain upon the joint the lucky steel did light and made such way that hewed it quite in twaine the paw yet missed not his minished might but hung still on the shield as it at first was pight for grief thereof and devilish despite from his infernal furnace forth he threw huge flames that dimmed all the heavens light enrolled in duskish smoke and brimstone blew as burning aetna from his boiling stew does belch out flames and rocks in pieces broke and ragged ribs of mountains melted new enwrapped in coalblack clouds and filthy smoke that all the land with stench and heaven with horror choke the heat whereof and harmful pestilence so soar him annoyed that forced him to retire a little backward for his best defence to save his body from the scorching fire which he from hellish entrails did expire it chanced eternal god that chance did guide as he recoiled backward in the mire his nigh forwearied feeble feet did slide and down he fell with dread of shame soar terrified there grew a goodly tree him fair beside loaded with fruit and apples rosy read as they in pure vermilion had been died whereof great virtues over all were read for happy life to all which thereon fed and life eke everlasting did befall great god it planted in that blessed stead with his almighty hand and did it call the tree of life the crime of our first father's fallen in all the world like was not to be found save in that soil where all good things did grow and freely sprung out of the fruitful ground as incorrupted nature did them sow till that dread dragon all did overthrow another like fair tree eke grew thereby whereof who so did eat eftsoons did know both good and ill oh mournful memory that tree through one men fault hath done us all to die from that first tree forth flowed as from a well a trickling stream of balm most sovereign and dainty deer which on the ground still fell and overflowed all the fertile plain as it had dewed be with timely rain life and long health that gracious ointment gave and deadly wounds could heal and rear again the senseless corpse appointed for the graven into that same he fell which did from death him save for nigh thereto the ever damned beast durst not approach for he was deadly made and all that life preserved did detest yet he it oft adventured to invade by this the drooping daylight gan to fade and yield his room to sad succeeding night who with her sable mantle gan to shade the face of earth and ways of living wight and high her burning torch set up in heaven bright when gentle vna saw the second fallen of her deer knight who weary of long fight and faint through loss of blond moved not at all but lay as in a dream of deep delight besmeared with precious balm whose virtuous might did heal his wounds and scorching heat allay again she stricken was with soar affright and for his safety gan devoutly pray and watch the noyous night and wait for joyous day the joyous day gan early to appear and fair aurora from her dewy bed of aged tithone gan her self to rear with rosy cheeks for shame as blushing read her golden locks for haste were loosely shed about her ears when vna her did mark climb to her chariot all with flowers spread from heaven high to chase the cheerless dark with merry note her loud salutes the mounting lark then freshly up arose the doughty knight all healed of his hurts and wounds wide and did himself to battle ready dight whose early foe awaiting him beside to have devoured so soon as day he spied when now he saw himself so freshly rear as if late fight had nought him damnified he wox dismayed and gan his fate to fear natheless with wonted rage he him advanced near and in his first encounter gaping wide he thought atonce him to have swallowed quite and rushed upon him with outrageous pride who him rencountering fierce as hawk in flight perforce rebutted back the weapon bright taking advantage of his open jaw ran through his mouth with so importune might that deep empierced his darksome hollow maw and back retired his life blood forth with all did draw so down he fell and forth his life did breath that vanished into smoke and clouds swift so down he fell that earth him underneath did groan as feeble so great load to lift so down he fell as and huge rocky clift whose false foundation waves have washed away with dreadful poise is from the mainland rift and rolling down great neptune does dismay so down he fell and like and heaped mountain lay the knight himself even trembled at his fallen so huge and horrible a mass it seemed and his deer lady that beheld it all durst not approach for dread which she misdeemed but yet at last when as the direful fiend she saw not stir off-shaking vain affright she nigher drew and saw that joyous end then god she praised and thanked her faithful knight that had achieved so great a conquest by his might cant. xii fair ʋna to the redcrosse knight betrothed is with joy though false duessa it to bar her false sleights do employ behold i see the haven nigh at hand to which i mean my weary course to bend vere the main xx and bear up with the land the which afore is fairly to be kenned and seems safe from storms that may offend there this fair virgin weary of her way must landed be now at her journeys end there eke my feeble bark a while may stay till merry wind and weather call her thence away scarcely had phoebus in the glooming east yet harnessed his fiery-footed teem ne reared above the earth his flaming crest when the last deadly smoke aloft did steam that sign of last outbreathed life did seem unto the watchman on the castle wall who thereby dead that baleful beast did deem and to his lord and lady loud gan call to tell how he had seen the dragons fatal fallen uprose with hasty joy and feeble speed that aged sire the lord of all that land and looked forth to weet if true indeed those tidings were as he did understand which whenas true by trial he out found he bade to open wide his brazen gate which long time had be shut and out of hound proclaimed joy and peace through all his state for dead now was their foe which them forayed late then gan triumphant trumpets found on high that sent to heaven the echoed report of their new joy and happy victory gainst him that had them long oppressed with tort and fast imprisoned in sieged fort then all the people as in solemn feast to him assembled with one full consort rejoicing at the fallen of that great beast from whose eternal bondage now they were released forth came that ancient lord and aged queen arrayed in antique robes down to the ground and sad habiliments right well beseen a noble crew about them waited round of sage and sober peers all gravely gowned whom far before did march a goodly band of tall young men all able arms to sound but now they laurel branches boar in hand glad sign of victory and peace in all their land unto that doughty conqueror they came and him before themselves prostrating low their lord and patron loud did him proclaim and at his feet their laurel boughs did throw soon after them all dancing on a row the comely virgins came with garlands dight as fresh as flowers in meadow green do grow when morning dew upon their leaves does light and in their hands sweet timbrels all upheld on hight and them before the fry of children young their wanton sports and childish mirth did play and to the maidens sounding timbrels sung in well attuned notes a joyous lay and made delightful music all the way until they came where that fair virgin stood as fair diana in fresh summers day beholds her nymphs enranged in shady wood some wrestle some do run some bath in crystal flood so she beheld those maidens merriment with cheerful view who when to her they came themselves to ground with gracious humbleness bent and her adored by honourable name lifting to heaven her everlasting fame then on her head they set a garland green and crowned her betwixt earnest and betwixt game who in her self-resemblance well beseen did seem such as she was a goodly maiden queen and after all the rascal many ran heaped together in rude rabblement to see the face of that victorious man whom all admired as from heaven sent and gazed upon with gaping wonderment but when they came where that dead dragon lay stretched on the ground in monstrons large extent the sighed with idle fear did them dismay ne durst approach him nigh to touch or once assay some feared and fled some feared and well it feigned one that would wiser seem then all the rest warned him not touch for yet perhaps remained some lingering life within his hollow breast or in his womb might lurk some hidden nest of many dragonets his fruitful seed another said that in his eyes did rest yet sparkling fire and bade thereof take heed another said he saw him move his eyes indeed one mother when as her foolhardy child did come too near and with his talons play half dead through fear her little babe reviled and to her gossips gan in counsel say how can i tell but that his talents may yet scratch my son or rend his tender hand so diversely themselves in vain they fray while some more bold to measure him nigh stand to prove how many acres he did spread of land thus flocked all the folk him round about the while that hoary king with all his train being arrived where that champion stout after his foes defeasance did remain him goodly greets and fair does entertain with princely gifts of ivory and gold and thousand thanks him yields for all his pain then when his daughter deer he does behold her dearly does embrace and kisses manifold and after to his palace he them brings with shawms & trumpets & with clarions sweet and all the way the joyous people sings and with their garments strews the paved street whence mounting up they find purveyance meet of all that royal princes court became and all the floor was underneath their feet bespread with costly scarlet of great name on which they lowly fit and fitting purpose frame what needs me tell their feast and goodly guise in which was nothing riotous nor vain what needs of dainty dishes to devise of comely services or courtly train my narrow leaves cannot in them contain the large discourse of royal princes state yet was their manner then but bore and plain for th'antique world excess and pride did hate such proud luxurious pomp is swollen up but late then when with meats and drinks of every kind their fervent appetites they quenched had that ancient lord gan fit occasion find of strange adventures and of perils sad which in his travel him befallen had for to demand of his renowned guest who then with utterance graven and countenance sad from point to point as is before expressed discoursed his voyage long according his request great pleasures mixed with pitiful regard that godly king and queen did passionate while they his pitiful adventures herd that oft they did lament his luckless state and often blame the too importune fate that heaped on him so many wrathful wreaks for never gentle knight as he of late so tossed was in fortune's cruel freaks and all the while salt tears bedewed the hearers cheeks then said the royal peer in sober wise dear son great been the evils which you boar from first to last in your late enterprise that i note whither praise or pity more for never living man i ween so soar in sea of deadly dangers was distressed but since now safe you seized have the shore and well arrived are high god be blessed let us devise of ease and everlasting rest ah dearest lord said then that doughty knight of ease or rest i may not yet devise for by the faith which i to arms have plighted i bounden am straight after this emprise as that your daughter can you well advise back to return to that great faery queen and her to serve six years in warlike wise gainst that proud pynim king that works her teen therefore i ought crave pardon till i there have been unhappy falls that hard necessity quoth he the troubler of my happy peace and vowed foe of my felicity ne i against the same can justly press but since that band you cannot now release nor done undo for vows may not be vain soon as the term of those six years shall cease you then shall hither back return again the marriage to accomplish vowed betwixt you twain which for my part i covet to perform in sort as through the world i did proclaim that who so killed that monster most deform and him in hardy battle overcame should have mine only daughter to his dame and of my kingdom heir apparent be therefore since now to thee pertains the same by due desert of noble chivalry both daughter and eke kingdom lo i yield to thee then forth he called that his daughter fair the fairest vn ' his only daughter deer his only daughter and his only heir who forth proceeding with sad sober cheer as bright as does the morning star appear out of the east with flaming locks bedight to tell the dawning day is dawning near and to the world does bring long wished light so fair and fresh that lady showed her self in sighed so fair and fresh as freshest flower in may for she had laid her mournful stole aside and widowlike sad wimple thrown away wherewith her heaunnly beauty she did hide while on her weary journey she did ride and on her now a garment she did wear all lily white withouten spot or pride that seemed like silk and silver woven near but neither silk nor silver therein did appear the blazing brightness of her beauty's beam and glorious light of her sunshiny face to tell were as to strive against the stream my ragged rhymes are all too rude and base her heavenly lineaments for to enchase ne wonder for her own deer loved knight all were she daily with himself in place did wonder much at her celestial sighed oft had he seen her fair but never so fair dight so fairly dight when she in presence came she to her sire made humble reverence and bowed low that her right well became and added grace unto her excellence who with great wisdom and graven eloquence thus gan to say but ear he thus had said with flying speed and seeming great pretence came running in much like a man dismayed a messenger with letters which his message said all in the open hall amazed stood at suddenness of that unwary sighed and wondered at his breathless hasty mood but he for nought would stay his passage right till fast before the king he did alight where falling flat great humbleness he did make and kissed the ground whereon his foot was pight then to his hands that writ he did betake which he disclosing read thus as the paper spoke to thee most mighty king of eden fair her greeting sends in these sad lines addressed the woeful daughter and forsaken heir of that great emperor of all the west and bids thee be advised for the best ere thou thy daughter link in holy band of wedlock to that new unknown guest for he already plighted his right hand unto another love and to another land to me sad maid or rather widow sad he was affianced long time before and sacred pledges he both gave and had false errant knight infamous and forswore witness the burning altars which he swore and guilty heavens of his bold perjury which though he hath polluted oft and yore yet i to them for judgement just do fly and them conjure avenge this shameful injury therefore since mine he is or free or bound or false or true or living or else dead withhold oh sovereign prince your hasty hound from knitting league with him i you aread ne ween my right with strength adown to tread through weakness of my widowed or woe for truth is strong his rightful cause to plead and shall find friends if need requires so so bids thee well to fare thy neither friend nor foe fidessa when he these bitter biting words had read the tidings strange did him abashed make that still he sat long time astonished as in great muse ne word to creature spoke at last his solemn silence thus he brake with doubtful eyes fast fixed on his guest redoubted knight that for mine only sake thy life and honour late adventurest let nought be hid from me that ought to be expressed what mean these bloody vows and idle threats thrown out from womanish impatient mind what heavens what altars what enraged heats here heaped up with terms of love unkind my conscience clear with guilty bans would bind high god be witness that i guiltless ame but if your self sir knight you faulty find or wrapped be in loves of former dame with crime do not it cover but disclose the same to whom the redcrosse knight this answer sent my lord my king be nought hereat dismayed till well you wot by graven intendiment what woman and wherefore does me upbraid with breach of love and loyalty betrayed it was in my mishaps as hitherward i lately traveled that unwares i strayed out of my way through perils strange and hard that day should fail me ere i had them all declared there did i find or rather i was found of this false woman that fidessa hight fidessa hight the falsest dame on ground most false duessa royal richly dight that easy was to inveigle weaker sighed who by her wicked arts and wily skill too false and strong for earthly skill or might vmwares me wrought'vnto her wicked will and to my foe betrayed when least i feared ill then stepped forth the goodly royal maid and on the ground her self prostrating low with sober countenance thus to him said oh pardon me my sovereign lord to show the secret treasons which of late i know to have be wrought by that false sorceress she only she it is that erst did throw this gentle knight into so great distress that death him did await in daily wretchedness and now it seems that she suborned hath this crafty messenger with letters vain to work new woe and improvided scathe by breaking of the band betwixt us twaine wherein she used hath the practic pain of this false footman cloaked with simpleness whom if you please for to discover plain you shall him archimago find i guess the falsest man alive woe tries shall find no less the king was greatly moved at her speech and all with sudden indignation fraught bade on that messenger rude hands to reach eftsoones the carded which on his state did wait attached that faitor false and bound him strait who seeming sorely chafed at his band as chained bear whom cruel dogs do bait with idle force did feign them to withstand and often semblance made to escape out of their hand but they him laid full low in dungeon deep and bound him hand and foot with iron chains and with continual watch did warily keep who then would think that by his subtle trains he could escape fowl death or deadly pains thus when that princes wrath was pacified he gan renew the late forbidden banes and to the knight his daughter deer he tied with sacred rites and vows for ever to abide his own two hands the holy knots did knit that none but death for ever can divide his own two hands for such a turn most fit the housling fire did kindle and provide and holy water thereon sprinkled wide at which the bushy teade a groom did light and sacred lamp in secret chamber hide where it should not be quenched day nor night for fear of evil fates but burnen ever bright then gan they sprinkle all the posts with wine and made great feast to solemnize that day they all perfumed with frankincense divine and precious odours fetched from far away that all the house did sweat with great array and all the while sweet music did apply her curious skill the warbling notes to play to driven away the dull melancholy the while one sung a song of love and jollity during the which there was and heavenly noise herd found through all the palace pleasantly like as it had be many and angels voice singing before th'eternall majesty in their trinal triplicities on high yet wist no creature whence that heavenly sweet proceeded yet eachone felt secretly himself thereby reft of his

lists debate and knighthood took of good sir huons hand when with king oberon he came to faery land him also accompanied upon the way a comely palmer clad in black attire of ripest years and hairs all hoary grey that with a staff his feeble steps did stir lest his long way his aged limbs should tire and if by looks one may the mind aread he seemed to be a sage and sober sire and ever with slow pace the knight did led who taught his trampling steed with equal steps to tread such whenas archimago them did view he weened well to work some uncouth wile eftsoon untwisting his deceitful clew he gan to weave a web of wicked guile and with a fair countenance and flattering style to them approaching thus the knight bespoke fair son of mars that seek with warlike spoil and great achievements great your self to make vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble misers sake he stayed his steed for humble misers sake and bad tell on the tenor of his plaint who feigning then in every limb to quake through

laid first his filthy hands on virgin clean to spoil her dainty corpse so fair and sheen as on the earth great mother of us all with living eye more fair was never seen of chastity and honour virginal witness you heavens whom she in vain to help did call how may it be said then the knight half wroth that knight should knighthood ever so have shent none but that saw quoth he would ween for troth how shamefully that maid he did torment her looser golden locks he rudely rend and drew her on the ground and his sharp sword against her snowy breast be fiercely bent and threatened death with many a bloody word tongue hates to tell the rest that eye to see abhorred therewith moved from his sober mood and lives he yet said he that wrought this act and done the heavens afford him vital food he lives quoth he and boasts of the fact ne yet hath any knight his courage cracked where may that traitor then said he be found or by what means may i his footing tract that shall i show said he as sure as hound the stricken dear does challenge by the bleeding wound he stayed not longer talk but with fierce ire and zealous haste away is quickly gone to seek that knight where him that crafty squire supposed to be they do arrive anon where sat a gentle lady all alone with garments rend and hair disheveled wringing her hands and making piteous moan her swollen eyes were much disfigured and her fair face with tears was foully blubbered the knight approaching nigh thus to her said fair lady through foul sorrow ill bedight great pity is to see you thus dismayed and mar the blossom of your beauty bright for thy appease your grief and heavy plighted and tell the cause of your conceived pain for if he live that hath you done despite he shall you do due recompense again or else his wrong with greater puissance maintain which when she herd as in despiteful wise she wilfully her sorrow did augment and offered hope of comfort did despise her golden locks most cruelly she rend and scratched her face with ghastly dreariment ne would she speak ne see ne yet be seen but hid her visage and her head down bent either for grievous shame or for great teen as if her heart with sorrow had transfixed been till her that squire bespoke madame my lief for gods deer love be not so wilful bent but do vouchsafe now to receive relief the which good fortune does to you present for what boots it to weep and to waiment when ill is chanced but does the ill increase and the weak mind with double woe torment when she her squire herd speak she gan appease her voluntary pain and feel some secret ease eftsoon she said ah gentle trusty squire what comfort can i woeful wretch conceive or why should ever i henceforth desire to see fair heavens face and life not leave sith that false traitor did my honour reave false traitor certes said the faery knight i read the man that ever would deceive a gentle lady or her wrong through might death were too little pain for such a foul despite but now fair lady comfort to you make and read who hath you wrought this shameful plighted that short revenge the man may overtake where so he be and soon upon him light certes said she i wot not how he hight but under him a grey steed did he wield whose sides with dappled circles weren dight upright he road and in his silver shield he boar a bloody cross that quartered all the field now by my head said guyon much i muse how that same knight should do so foul amiss or ever gentle damosel so abuse for may i boldly say he surely is a right good knight and true of word ywis i present was and can it witness well when arms he swore and straight did enterprise th'aduenture of the errant damosel in which he hath great glory won as i hear tell natheless he shortly shall again be tried and

pain and see the salving of your blotted name full loath she seemed thereto but yet did feign for she was inly glad her purpose so to gain her purpose was not such as she did feign ne yet her person such as it was seen but under simple show and semblant plain lurked false duessa secretly unseen as a chaste virgin that had wronged been so had false archimago her disguised to cloak her guile with sorrow and sad teen and eke himself had craftily devised to be her squire and do her service well aguised her late forlorn and naked he had found where she did wander in waste wilderness lurking in rocks and caves far under ground and with green mode covering her nakedness to hide her shame and loathly filthiness sith her prince arthur of proud ornaments and borrowed beauty spoiled her natheless th'enchaunter finding fit for his intents did thus revest and decked with due habiliments for all he did was to deceive good knights and draw them from pursuit of praise and fame to slug in sloth and sensual delights and end their days with irrenowned shame and now exceeding grief him overcame to see the redcrosse thus advanced high therefore this crafty engine he did frame against his praise to stir up enmity ofsuch as virtues like mote unto him ally so now he guyon guides and uncouth way through woods & mountains till they came at last into a pleasant dale that lowly lay betwixt two hills whose high heads overplaced the valley did with cool shade overcast through midst thereof a little river rolled by which there sat a knight with helm unlaced himself refreshing with the liquid cold after his travel long and labours manifold loe yonder he cried archimage aloud that wrought the shameful fast which i did show and now he does himself in secret shroud to fly the vengeance for his outrage due but vain for you shall dearly do him rew so god you speed and send you good success which we far off will here abide to view so they him left inflamed with wrathfulness that straight against that knight his spear he did address who seeing him from far so fierce to prick his warlike arms about him gan embrace and in the rest his ready spear did stick though when as still he saw him towards pace he gan rencounter him in equal raze they be met both ready to affrap when suddenly that warrriour gan abase his threatened spear as if some new mishap had him betid or hidden danger did entrap and cried mercy sir knight and mercy lord for mine offence and heedless hardiment that had almost committed crime abhorred and with reproachful shame mine honour shent while cursed steel against that badge i bent the sacred badge of my redeemer's death which on your shield is set for ornament but his fierce foe his steed could stay uneath who pricked with courage keen did cruel battle breath but when he herd him speak straight way he knew his error and himself inclining said ah deer sir guyon well becomes you but me behooves rather to upbraid whose hasty hand so far from reason strayed that almost it did heinous violence on that fair image of that heavenly maid that decks and arms your shield with fair defence your curtsy takes on you another's due offence so be they both atone and done uprear their beavers bright each other for to greet goodly comportance each to other bear and entertain themselves with courtesies meet then said the redcrosse knight now mote i weet sir guyon why with so fierce salience and fell intent you did at erst me meet for sith i know your goodly governance great cause i ween you guided or some uncouth chance certes said he well mote i shame to tell the found encheason that me hither led a false infamous faitour late befell me for to meet that seemed ill bested and plained of grievous outrage which he read a knight had wrought against a lady gent which to avenge he to this place me led where you he made the mark of his intent and now is fled foul shame him follow where he went so can he turn his earnest unto game through goodly handing and wise temperance by this his aged guide in presence came who soon as on that knight his eye did glance eft soon of him had perfect cognizance sith him in faery court he late advised

wish your thought that home you may report these happy news for well you worthy be for worth and gentle thews so courteous congé both did give and take with right hands plighted pledges of good will then guyon forward gan his voyage make with his black palmer that him guided still still he him guided over dale and hill and with his steady staff did point his way his raze with reason and with words his will from foul intemperance he oft did stay and suffered not in wrath his hasty steps to stray in this fair wise they traveled long yfere through many hard assays which did betide of which he honour still away did bear and spread his glory through all countries wide at last as chanced them by a forest side to pass for succour from the scorching ray they herd a rueful voice that dernly cried with piercing shrieks and many a doleful lay which to attend a while their forward steps they stay but if that careless heavens quoth she despise the doom of just revenge and take delight to see sad pageants of men's misery's as bound by them to live in lives despite yet can they not warn death from wretched wight come then come soon come sweetest death to me and take away this long lent loathed light sharp be thy wounds but sweet the medicines be that long captived souls from weary thraldom free but thou sweet babe whom frowning froward fate hath made sad witness of thy father's fallen sith heaven thee deigns to hold in living state long mayest thou live and better thrive withal then to thy luckless parents did befall live thou and to thy mother dead attest that clear she died from blemish criminal thy little hands imbrued in bleeding breast lo i for pledges leave so give me leave to rest with that a deadly shriek she forth did throw that through the wood reechoed again and after gave a groan so deep and low that seemed her tender heart was rend in twaine or thrilled with point of thorough piercing pain as gentle hind whose sides with cruel steel through launched forth her bleeding life does rain while the sad pang approaching she does feel brays out her latest breath and up her eyes does seel which when that warrior herd dismounting strait from his tall steed he rushed into the thick and soon arrived where that sad portrait of death and labour lay half dead half quick in whose white alabaster breast did stick a cruel knife that made a grisly wound from which forth gushed a stream of goreblood thick that all her goodly garments stained around and into a deep sanguine died the grassy ground pitiful spectacle of deadly smart beside a bubbling fountain low she lay which she increased with her bleeding heart and the clean waves with purple gold did ray also in her lap a lovely babe did play his cruel sport in stead of sorrow due for in her streaming blood he did embay his little hands and tender joints embrew pitiful spectacle as ever eye did view beside them both upon the soiled grass the dead corpse of and armed knight was spread whose armour all with blood besprinkled was his ruddy lips did smile and rosy read did paint his cheerful cheeks yet being dead seemed to have been a goodly personage now in his freshest flower of lusty head fit to inflame fair lady with loves rage but that fierce fate did crop the blossom of his age whom when the good sir guyon did behold his heart gan wax as stark as marble stone and his fresh blood did frieze with fearful cold that all his senses seemed bereft atone at last his mighty ghost gan deep to groan as lyon grudging in his great disdain mourns inwardly and makes to himself moan till ruth and frail affection did constrain his stout courage to stoop and show his inward pain out of her gored wound the cruel steel he lightly snatched and did the floodgate stop with his fair garment then gan softly feel her feeble pulse to prove if any drop of living blood yet in her veins did hop which when he felt to move he hoped fair to call back life to her forsaken shop so well he did her deadly wounds repair that at the last she gan to breath out living air which he perceiving greatly gan rejoice and goodly counsel that for wounded heart is meetest medicine tempered with sweet voice ay me deer lady which the image art of rueful pity and impatient smart what direful chance armed with revenging fate or cursed hand hath played this cruel part thus fowl to hasten your untimely date speak oh deer lady speak help never comes too late therewith her dim eyelids she up gan rear on which the dreary death did fit as sad as lump of led and made dark clouds appear but when as him all in bright armour clad before her standing she espied had as one out of a deadly dream affright she weakly started yet she nothing dread straight down again her self in great despite she groveling threw to ground as hating life and light the gentle knight her soon with careful pain uplifted light and softly did uphold thrice he her reared and thrice she sunk again till he his arms about her sides gan fold and to her said yet if the stony cold have not all seized on your frozen heart let one word fallen that may your grief unfold and tell the secret of your mortal smart he oft finds present help who does his grief impart then casting up a deadly look full low she sighed from bottom of her wounded breast and after many bitter throbs did throw with lips full pale and faltering tongue oppressed these words she breathed forth from riven chest leave ah leave off what ever wight thou be to let a weary wretch from her due rest and trouble dying souls tranquillity take not away now god which none would give to me ah far be it said he dear dame from me to hinder soul from her desired rest or hold sad life in long captivity for all i seek is but to have redressed the bitter pangs that does your heart infest tell then o lady tell what fatal proof hath with so huge misfortune you oppressed that i may cast to compass your relief or die with you in sorrow and partake your grief with feeble hands then stretched forth on high as heaven accusing guilty of her death and with dry drops congealed in her eye in these sad words she spent her utmost breath hear then o man the sorrows that uneath my tongue can tell so far all sense they pass lo this dead corpse that lies here underneath the gentlest knight that ever on green grass gay steed with spurs did prick the good sir mortdant was was ay the while that he is not so now my lord my love my deer lord my deer love so long as heavens just with equal brow vouchsafed to behold us from above one day when him high courage did emmove as wont you knights to seek adventures wild he pricked forth his puissant force to prove me then he left enwombed of this child this luckless child whom thus you see with blood defiled him fortuned hard fortune you may guess to come where vile acrasia does won acrasia a false enchantress that many errant knights hath foul fordone within a wandering island that does run and stray in perilous gulf her dwelling is fair sir if ever there you travel shun the cursed land where many weened amiss and know it by the name it hight the bower of bliss her bliss is all in pleasure and delight wherewith she makes her lovers drunken mad and then with words & weeds of wondrous might on them she works her will to uses bad my liefest lord she thus beguiled had for he was flesh all flesh does frailty breed whom when i herd to been so ill bestead weak wretch i wrapped my self in palmers weed and cast to seek him forth through danger and great dread now had fair cynthia by even turns full measured three quarters of her year and thrice three times had filled her crooked horns when as my womb her burden would forbear and bade me call lucina to me near lucina came a manchild forth i brought the woods the nymphs my bowers my midwives wear hard help at need so deer thee babe i bought yet nought too deer i deemed while so my dear i sought him so i sought and so at last i found where him that witch had thralled to her will in chains of lust and lewd desires bound and so transformed from his former skill that me he knew not neither his own ill till through wise handling and fair governance i him recured to a better will purged from drugs of foul intemperance then means i gan devise for his deliverance which when the vile enchantress perceived how that my lord from her i would reprieve with cup thus charmed him parting she deceived sad verse give death to him that death does give and loss of love to her that loves to live so soon as bacchus with the nymph does link so parted we and on our journey driven till coming to this well he stooped to drink the charm fulfilled dead suddenly he down did sink which when i wretch not one word more she said but breaking off the end for want of breath and sliding soft as down to sleep her laid and ended all her woe in quiet death that seeing good sir guyon could uneath from tears abstain for grief his heart did grate and from so heavy sighed his head did wreathe accusing fortune and too cruel fate which plunged had fair lady in so wretched state then turning to his palmer said old sire behold the image of mortality and feeble nature clothed with fleshly tyre when raging passion with fierce tyranny robs reason of her due regality and makes it servant to her basest part the strong it weakens with infirmity and with bold fury arms the weakest heart the strong through pleasure soonest falls the weak through smart but temperance said he with golden squire betwixt them both can measure out a mean neither to melt in pleasures hot desire nor fry in heartless grief and doleful teen thrice happy man who fares them both atween but sith this wretched woman overcome of anguish rather then of crime hath been reserve her cause to her eternal doom and in the mean vouchsafe her honourable tomb palmer quoth he death is and evil doom to good and bad the common inn of rest but after death the trial is to come when best shall be to them that lived best but both alike when death hath both suppressed religious reverence does burial teen which who so wants wants so much of his rest for all so great shame after death i ween as self to dyen bad unburied bad to been so both agree their bodies to engrave the great earth's womb they open to the sky and with sad cypress seemly it embrave then covering with a clod their closed eye they lay therein those corpses tenderly and bid them sleep in everlasting peace but ere they did their utmost obsequy sir guyon more affection to increase bynempt a sacred vow which none should aye release the dead knights sword out of his sheath he drew with which he cut a lock of all their hear which meddling with their blood and earth he threw into the graven and gan devoutly swear such and such evil godon guyon rear and worse and worse young orphan be thy pain if i or thou due vengeance do forbear till guilty blood her guerdon do obtain so shedding many tears they closed the earth again cant. ii babes bloody hands may not be cleansed the face of golden mean her sisters two extremities strive her to banish clean thus when sir guyon with his faithful guide had with due rites and dolorous lament the end of their sad tragedy uptied the little babe up in his arms he hent who with sweet pleasance and bold blandishment gan smile on them that rather ought to weep as careless of his woe or innocent of that was done that ruth empierced deep in that knights heart and words with bitter tears did steep ah luckless babe born under cruel star and in dead parents baleful ashes bred full little weenest thou what sorrows are left thee for portion of thy livelihood poor orphan in the wide world scattered as budding branch rend from the native tree and thrown forth till it be withered such is the state of men thus enter we into this life with woe and end with misery then soft himself inclining on his knee down to that well did in the water ween so love does loath disdainful nicety his guilty hands from bloody gore to clean he washed them oft and oft yet nought they been for all his washing cleaner still he strove yet still the little hands were bloody seen the which him into great amazement drove and into diverse doubt his wavering wonder clove he wist not whither blot of foul offence might not be purged with water nor with bath or that high god in lieu of innocence imprinted had that token of his wrath to show how soar bloodguiltiness he hates or that the charm and venom which they drunk their blood with secret filth infected hath being diffused through the senseless trunk that through the great contagion direful deadly stunk whom thus at gaze the palmer gan to board with goodly reason and thus fair bespoke you be right hard amated gracious lord and of your ignorance great marvel make while cause not well conceived you mistake but know that secret virtues are infused in every fountain and in every lake which who hath skill them rightly to have choosed to proof of passing wonders hath full often used of those some were so from their source endued by great dame nature from whose fruitful pap their wellheads spring and are with moisture dewed which feeds each living plant with liquid sap and fills with flowers fair floraes painted lap but other some by gift of later grace or by good prayers or by other hap had virtue poured into their waters base and thenceforth were renowned & sought from place to place such is this well wrought by occasion strange which to her nymph befell upon a day as she the woods with bow and shafts did range the heartless hind and roebuck to dismay dan faunus chanced to meet her by the way and kindling fire at her fair burning eye inflamed was to follow beauty's chase and chased her that fast from him did fly as hind from her so she fled from her enemy at last when failing breath began to faint and saw no means to escape of shame afraid she set her down to weep for soar constraint and to diana calling loud for aid her deer besought to let her die a maid the goddess herd and sudden where she sat welling out streams of tears and quite dismayed with stony fear of that rude rustic mate transformed her to a stone from steadfast virgins state lo now she is that stone from those two heads as from two weeping eyes fresh streams do flow yet cold through fear and old conceived dreads and yet the stone her semblance seems to show shaped like a maid that such you may her know and yet her virtues in her water bide for it is chaste and pure as purest snow ne lets her waves with any filth he died but ever like her self unstained hath been tried from thence it comes that this babes bloody hand may not be cleansed with water of this well ne certes sir strive you it to withstand but let them still be bloody as befell that they his mother's innocence may tell as she bequeathed in her last testament that as a sacred symbol it may dwell in her sons flesh to mind revengement and be for all chaste dams and endless monument he hearkened to his reason and the child uptaking to the palmer gave to bear but his sad father's arms with blond defiled and heavy load himself did lightly rear and turning to that place in which whilere he left his lofty steed with golden fell and goodly gorgeous barbs him found not there by other accident that erst befell he is conveyed but how or where here fits not tell which when sir guyon saw all were he wroth yet algates mote he soft himself appease and fairly fare on foot how ever loath his double burden did him soar disease so long they traveled with little ease till that at last they to a castle came built on a rock adjoining to the seas it was and ancient work of antique fame and wondrous strong by nature and by skilful frame therein three sisters dwelled of sundry sort the children of one sire by mother's three who dying whilom did divide this fort to them by equal shares in equal fee but strifeful mind and diverse quality drew them in parts and each made others foe still did they strive and daily disagree the eldest did against the youngest go and both against the midst meant to work woe where when the knight arrived he was right well received as knight of so much worth became of second sister who did far excel the other two medina was her name a sober sad and comely courteous dame who rich arrayed and yet in modest guise in goodly garments that her well became fair marching forth in honourable wise him at the threshold met and well did enterprise she led him up into a goodly bower and comely courted with meet modesty ne in her speech ne in her haviour was lightness seen or looser vanity but gracious womanhood and gravity above the reason of her youthly years her golden locks she roundly did uptie in braided trammel's that no looser hears did out of order stray about her dainty ears whilst she her self thus busily did frame seemly to entertain her newcome guest news hereof to her other sisters came who all this while were at their wanton rest accourting each her friend with lavish fist they were two knights of peerless puissance and famous far abroad for warlike gest which to these ladies love did countenance and to his mistress each himself strove to advance he that made love unto the eldest dame was hight sir huddibras and hardy man yet not so good of deeds as great of name which he by many rash adventures wan since errant arms to sew he first began more huge in strength then wise in works he was and reason with foolhardize over ran stern melancholy did his courage pass and was for terror more all armed in shining brass but he that loved the youngest was sansioy he that fair vna late fowl outraged the most unruly and the boldest boy that ever warlike weapons managed and to all lawless lust encouraged through strong opinion of his matchless might ne ought he cared whom he endamaged by tortious wrong or whom bereaved of right he now this ladies champion chosen for love to fight these two gay knights vowed to so diverse loves each other does envy with deadly hate and daily war against his foeman moves in hope to win more favour with his mate and th'others pleasing service to abate to magnify his own but when they herd how in that place strange knight arrived late both knights and ladies forth right angry fared and fiercely unto battle stern themselves prepared but ere they could proceed unto the place where he abided themselves at discord fell and cruel combat joined in middle space with horrible assault and fury fell they heaped huge strokes the scorned life to quell that all on uproar from her settled seat the house was raised and all that in did dwell seemed that loud thunder with amazement great did rend the rattling skies with flames of fouldering heat the noise thereof calth forth that stranger knight to weet what dreadful thing was there in hand where when as two brave knights in bloody fight with deadly rancour he enranged found his sunbroad shield about his wrest he bound and shining blade unsheathed with which he ran unto that stead their strife to understand and at his first arrival them began with goodly means to pacify well as he can but they him spying both with greedy force atonce upon him ran and him beset with strokes of mortal steel without remorse and on his shield like iron sledges bet as when a bear and tiger being met in cruel fight on lybic ocean wide espy a traveller with feet surbate whom they in equal prey hope to divide they stint their strife and him assail on every side but he not like a weary traveller their sharp assault right bloody did rebut and suffered not their blows to bite him never but with redoubled buffs them back did put whose grieved minds which choler did englut against themselves turning their wrathful spite gan with new rage their shields to hew and cut but still when guyon came to part their fight with heavy load on him they freshly gan to smite as a tallship tossed in troublous seas whom raging winds threatening to make the prey of the rough rocks do diversely disease meets two contrary billows by the way that her on either side do soar assay and boast to swallow her in greedy graven she scorning both their spites does make wide way and with her breast breaking the foamy wave does ride on both their backs & fair her self does save so boldly he him bears and rushes forth between them both by conduct of his blade wondrous great prowess and heroic worth he showed that day and rare ensample made when two so mighty warriors he dismayed atonce he wards and strikes he takes and pays now forced to yield now forcing to invade before behind and round about him lays so double was his pains so double be his praise strange sort of fight three valiant knights to see three combats join in one and to deraign a triple war with triple enmity all for their ladies froward love to gain which got was but hate so love does rain in stoutest minds and makes monstrous war he makes war he makes peace again and yet his peace is but continual jar oh miserable men that to him subject are while thus they mingled were in furious arms the fair medina with her tresses torn and naked breast in pity of their harms amongst them ran and falling them before besought them by the womb which them had born and by the loves which were to them most deer and by the knighthood which they sure had sworn their deadly cruel discord to forbear and to her just conditions of fair peace to hear but her two other sisters standing by her loud gainsaid and both their champion bade pursue the end of their strong enmity as ever of their loves they would be glad yet she with pithy words and counsel sad still strove their stubborn rages to revoke that at the last suppressing fury mad they gan abstain from dint of direful stroke and harken to the sober speeches which she spoke ah puissant lords what cursed evil spright or fell erinnys in your noble hearts her hellish brand hath kindled with despite and stirred you up to work your wilful smarts is this the joy of arms be these the parts of glorious knighthood after blood to thrust and not regard due right and just deserts vain is the vaunt and victory unjust that more to mighty hands them rightful cause does trust and were their rightful cause of difference yet were not better fair it to accord then with blood guiltiness to heap offence and mortal vengeance join to crime abhorred o fly from wrath fly oh my liefest lord sad be the sights and bitter fruits of war and thousand furies wait on wrathful sword ne ought the praise of prowess more does mar then fowl revenging rage and base contentious jar but lovely concord and most sacred peace does nourish virtue and fast friendship breeds weak she makes strong & strong thing does increase till it the pitch of highest praise exceeds brave be her wars and honourable deeds by which she triumphs over ire and pride and wins and olive garland for her meeds be therefore oh my deer lords pacified and this misseeming discord meekly lay aside her gracious words their rancour did appall and sunk so deep into their boiling breasts that down they let their cruel weapons fallen and lowly did abase their lofty crests to her fair presence and discrete behests then she began a treaty to procure and establish terms betwixt both their requests that as a law for ever should endure which to observe in word of knights they did assure which to confirm and fast to bind their league after their weary sweat and bloody toil she them besought during their quiet treague into her lodging to repair a while to rest themselves and grace to reconcile they soon consent so forth with her they fare where they are well received and made to spoil themselves of soiled arms and to prepare their minds to pleasure & their mouths to dainty fare and those two froward sisters their fair loves came with them eke all were they wondrous loath and feigned cheer as for the time behooves but could not colour yet so well the troth but that their nature's bad appeared in both for both did at their second sister grutch and inly grieve as does and hidden moth the inner garment fret not utter touch one thought their cheer too little th'other thought too much elissa so the eldest hight did deem such entertainment base ne ought would eat ne ought would speak but evermore did seem as discontent for want of mirth or meat no solace could her paramour entreat her once to show ne court nor dalliance but with bent lowering brows as she would threat she scold and frowned with froward countenance unworthy of fair ladies comely governance but young perissa was of other mind full of disport still laughing loosely light and quite contrary to her sisters kind no measure in her mood no rule of right but poured out in pleasure and delight in wine and meats she flowed above the bank and in excess exceeded her own might in sumptuous tire she joyed her self to prank but of her love too lavish little have she thank first by her side did fit the bold sansioy fit mate for such a mincing minion who in her looseness took exceeding joy might not be found a franker franion of her lewd parts to make companion but huddibras more like a malcontent did see and grieve at his bold fashion hardly could he endure his hardiment yet still he sat and inly did him self torment betwixt them both the fair medina sat with sober grace and goodly carriage with equal measure she did moderate the strong extremities of their outrage that forward pair she ever would assuage when they would strive due reason to exceed but that same froward twaine would accourage and of her plenty add unto their need so kept she them in order and her self in heed thus fairly she attempered her feast and pleased them all with meet satiety at last when lust of meat and drink was ceased she guyon deer besought of courtesy to tell from whence he came through jeopardy and whither now on new adventure bound who with bold grace and comely gravity drawing to him the eyes of all around from lofty siege began these words aloud to found this thy demand o lady does revive

view night was far spent and now in ocean deep orion flying fast from hissing snake his flaming head did hasten for to steep when of his piteous tale he end did make whilst with delight of that he

the misty night and titan playing on the eastern streams gan clear the dewy air with springing light sir guyon mindful of his vow plighted uprose from drowsy couch and him addressed unto the journey which he had behight his puissant arms about his noble breast and manifold shield he bound about his wrest then taking congé of that virgin pure the bloody-handed babe unto her truth did earnestly commit and her conjure in virtuous lore to train his tender youth and all that gentle nouriture ensues and that so soon as riper years he reached he might for memory of that days ruth be called ruddymane and thereby taught avenge his parents death on them that had it wrought so forth he fared as now befell on foot sith his good steed is lately from him gone patience perforce helpless what may it boot to fret for anger or for grief to moan his palmer now shall foot no more alone so fortune wrought as under green woods side he lately herd that dying lady groan he left his steed without and spear beside and rushed in on foot to aid her ere she died the while a losel wandering by the way one that to bounty never cast his mind ne thought of honour ever did assay his baser breast but in his kestrel kind a pleasing vain of glory vain did find to which his flowing tongue and troublous spright gave him great aid and made him more inclined he that brave steed there finding ready dight purloined both steed and spear and ran away full light now gan his heart all swell in jollity and of him self great hope and help conceived that puffed up with smoke of vanity and with self-loved personage deceived he gan to hope of men to be received for such as he him thought or feign would be but for in court gay portance he perceived and gallant show to be in greatest gree eftsoons to court he cast advance his first degree and by the way he chanced to espy one sitting idle on a sunny bank to whom avanting in great bravery as peacocke that his painted plumes does prank he smote his courser in the trembling flank and to him threatened his heart-thrilling spear the silly man seeing him ride so rank and aim at him fell flat to ground for fear and crying mercy loud his piteous hands gan rear thereat the scarecrow waxed wondrous proud through fortune of his first adventure fair and with big thundering voice reviled him loud vile caitiff vassal of dread and despair unworthy of the commune breathed air why livest thou dead dog a longer day and dost not unto death thy self prepare dye or thy self my captive yield for ay great favour i thee grant for answer thus to stay hold o

fallen and kiss my stirrup that thy homage be the miser threw him self as and offal straight at his foot in base humility and cleped him his liege to hold of him in fee so happy peace they made and fair accord eftsoons this liegeman gan to wax more bold and when he felt the folly of his lord in his own kind he gan him self unfold for he was wily witted and grown old in cunning sleights and practic knavery for that day forth he cast for to uphold his idle humour with fine flattery and blow the bellows to his swelling vanity trompart fit man for braggadochio to serve at court in view of vaunting eye vainglorious man when fluttering wind does blow in his light wings is lifted up to sky the scorn of knighthood and true chivalry to think without desert of gentle deed and noble worth to be advanced high such praise is shame but honour virtues meed does bear the fairest flower in honourable seed so forth they pass a well consorted pair till that at length with archimage they meet who seeing one that shone in armour fair on goodly courser thundering with his feet eftsoons supposed him a person meet of his revenge to make the instrument for since the redcrosse knight he erst did weet to been with guyon knit in one consent the ill which erst to him he now to guyon meant and coming close to trompart gan inquire of him what mighty warrior that mote be that road in golden fell with single spear but wanted sword to wreak his enmity he is a great adventurer said he that hath his sword through hard assay forgone and now hath vowed till he avenged be of that despite never to wearen none that spear is him enough to done a thousand groan th'enchaunter greatly joyed in the vaunt and weened well ere long his will to win and both his foes with equal foil to daunt tho to him louting lowly did begin to plain of wrongs which had committed been by guyon and by that false redcrosse knight which two through treason and deceitful gin had slain sir mordant and his lady bright that mote him honour win to wreak so foul despite therewith all suddenly he seemed enraged and threatened death with dreadful countenance as if their lives had in his hand been gaged and with stiff force shaking his mortal lance to let him weet his doughty valiance thus said old man great sure shall thy meed if where those knights for fear of due vengeance do lurk thou certainly to me aread that i may wreak on them their heinous hateful deed certes my lord said he that shall i soon and give you eke good help to their decay but mote i wisely you advise to done give no ods to your foes but do purvey your self of sword before that bloody day for they be two the prowest knights on ground and oft approved in many hard assay and eke of surest steel that may be found do arm your self against that day them to confound dotard said he let be thy deep advise seems that through many years thy wits thee fail and that weak eld hath left thee nothing wise else never should thy judgement be so frail to measure manhood by the sword or mail is not enough foure quarters of a man withouten sword or shield and host to quail thou little wotest what this right hand can speak they which have beheld the battles which it won the man was much abashed at his boast yet well he wist that who so would contend with either of those knights on even coast should need of all his arms him to defend yet feared lest his boldness should offend when braggadocchio said once i did swear when with one sword seuen knights i brought to end thence forth in battle never sword to bear but it were that which noblest knight on earth does wear perdie sir knight said then th'enchaunter belive that shall i shortly purchase to your hound for now the best and noblest knight alive prince arthur is that wones in faery land he hath a sword that flames like burning brand the same by my advise i undertake shall by to morrow by thy side be found at which bold word that boaster gan to quake and wondered in his mind what mote that monster make he stayed not for more bidding but away was sudden vanished out of his sighed the northern wind his wings did broad display at his command and reared him up light from off the earth to take his aerie flight they look about but no where could espy tract of his foot then dead through great affright they both nigh were and each bad other fly both fled atonce ne ever back returned eye till that they come unto a forest green in which they shroud themselves from causeless fear yet fear them follows still where so they been each trembling leaf and whistling wind they hear as ghastly bug their hair on end does rear yet both do strive their fearfulness to feign at last they herd a horn that shrilled clear throughout the wood that echoed again and made the forest ring as it would rive in twaine eft through the thick they herd one rudely rush with noise whereof he from his lofty steed down fell to ground and crept into a bush to hide his coward head from dying dread but trompart stoutly stayed to taken heed of what might hap eftsoon there stepped forth a goodly lady clad in hunter's weed that seemed to be a woman of great worth and by her stately portance born of heavenly birth her face so fair as flesh it seemed not but heavenly portrait of bright angels hew clear as the sky withouten blame or blot through goodly mixture of complexions due and in her cheeks the vermeil read did show like roses in a bed of lilies shed the which ambrosial odours from them threw and gazers sense with double pleasure fed able to heal the sick and to revive the dead in her fair eyes two living lamps did flame kindled above at heavenly makers light and darted firy beams out of the same so passing perceant and so wondrous bright that quite bereaved the rash beholders sighed in them the blinded god his lustful fire to kindle oft assayed but had no might for with dreaded majesty and awful ire she broke his wanton darts and quenched base desire her ivory forehead full of bounty brave like a broad table did it self dispread for love his lofty triumphs to engrave and write the battles of his great godhead all good and honour might therein be read for there their dwelling was and when she spoke sweet words like dropping honey she did shed and betwixt the pearls and rubies softly brake a silver found that heavenly music seemed to make upon her eyelids many graces sat under the shadow of her even brows working belgard's and amorous retreat and every one her with a grace endows and every one with meekness to her bows so glorious mirror of celestial grace and sovereign monument of mortal vows how shall frail pen describe her heavenly face for fear through want of skill her beauty to disgrace so fair and thousand thousand times more fair she seemed when she presented was to sighed and was clad for heat of scorching air all in a silken camus lily white purfled upon with many a folded plighted which all above besprinkled was throughout with golden aglets that glistered bright like twinkling stars and all the skirt about was hemmed with golden fringe below her ham her weed did somewhat train and her straight legs most bravely were embailed in gilded buskin's of costly cordwaine all barred with golden bends which were entailed with curious antics and full fair aumailed before they fastened were under her knee in a rich jewel and therein entrailed the ends of all their knots that none might see how they within their foldings close enwrapped be like two fair marble pillars they were seen which do the temple of the gods support whom all the people deck with garlands green and honour in their festival resort those same with stately grace and princely port she taught to tread when she her self would grace but with the woody nymphs when she did play or when the flying libbard she did chase she could them nimbly move and after fly apace and in her hand a sharp boar-spear she held and at her back a bow and quiver gay stuffed with steelheaded darts wherewith she quelled the salvage beasts in her victorious play knit with a golden baldric which forelay athwart her snowy breast and did divide her dainty paps which like young fruit in may now little gan to swell and being tide through her thin weed their places only signified her yellow locks crisped like golden wire about her shoulders weren loosely shed and when the wind amongst them did inspire they waved like a pennon wide dispread and low behind her back were scattered and whither art it were or heedless hap as through the flowering forest rash she fled in her rude hairs sweet flowers themselves did lap and flourishing fresh leaves and blossoms did enwrap such as diana by the sandy shore of swift eurotas or on cynthus green where all the nymphs have her unwares forlore wandereth alone with bow and arrows keen to seek her game or as that famous queen of amazons whom pyrrhus did destroy the day that first of priame she was seen did show her self in great triumphant joy to succour the weak state of sad afflicted troy such when as heartless trompart her did view he was dismayed in his coward mind and doubted whither he himself should show or fly away or bide alone behind both fear and hope he in her face did find when she at last him spying thus bespoke hail groom didst not thou see a bleeding hind whose right haunch erst my steadfast arrow strake if thou didst tell me that i may her overtake wherewith revived this answer forth he threw oh goddess for such i thee take to be for neither does thy face terrestrial show nor voice found mortal i avow to thee such wounded beast as that i did not see sith erst into this forest wild i came but mote thy goodlihead forgive it me to weet which of the gods i shall thee name that unto thee due worship i may rightly frame to whom she thus but ere her words ensued unto the bush her eye did sudden glance in which vain braggadocchio was mewed and saw it stir she left her piercing lance and towards gan a deadly shaft advance in mind to mark the beast at which sad stour trompart forth stepped to stay the mortal chance out crying o what ever heavenly pour or earthly wight thou be withhold this deadly hour o stay thy hand for yonder is no game for thy fierce arrows them to exercise but lo my lord my liege whose warlike name is far renowned through many bold emprise and now in shade he shrouded yonder lies she stayed with that he crawled out of his nest forth creeping on his caitiff hands and thighs and standing stoutly up his lofty crest did fiercely shake and rouse as coming late from rest as fearful fowl that long in secret cave for dread of soaring hawk her self hath hid not caring how her silly life to save she her gay painted plumes disordered seeing at last her self from danger rid peeps forth and soon renews her native pride she begins her feathers foul disfigured proudly to prune and set on every side so shakes off shame ne thinks how erst she did her hide so when her goodly visage he beheld he gan himself to vaunt but when he viewed those deadly tools which in her hand she held soon into other fits he was transmoved till she to him her gracious speech renewed all hail sir knight and well may thee befall as all the like which honour have pursued through deeds of arms and prowess martial all virtue merits praise but such the most of all to whom he thus o fairest under sky true be thy words and worthy of thy praise that warlike feats dost highest glorify therein have i spent all my youthly days and many battles fought and many frays throughout the world where so they might be found endeavouring my dreaded name to raise above the moon that fame may it resound in her eternal trump with laurel garland crowned but what art thou o lady which dost range in this wild forest where no pleasure is and dost not it for joyous court exchange amongst thine equal peers where happy bliss and all delight does reign much more then this there thou mayest love and dearly loved be and swim in pleasure which thou here dost miss there mayest thou best be seen and best mayest see the wood is fit for beasts the court is fit for thee who so in pomp of proud estate quoth she does swim and baths himself in courtly bliss does waste his days in dark obscurity and in oblivion ever buried is where ease abounds it's eath to do amiss but who his limbs with labours and his mind behaves with cares cannot so easy miss abroad in arms at home in studious kind who seeks with painful toil shall honour soonest find in woods in waves in wars she wonts to dwell and will be found with peril and with pain ne can the man that moulds in idle cell unto her happy mansion attain before her gate high god did sweat ordain and wakeful watches ever to abide but easy is the way and passage plain to pleasures palace it may soon be spied and day and night her doors to all stand open wide in princes court the rest she would have said but that the foolish man filled with delight of her sweet words that all his sense dismayed and with her wondrous beauty ravished quite gan burn in filthy lust and leaping light thought in his bastard arms her to embrace with that she swerving back her javelin bright against him bent and fiercely did menace so turned her about and fled away apace which when the peasant saw amazed he stood and grieved at her flight yet durst he not pursue her steps through wild unknown wood beside he feared her wrath and threatened shot while in the bush he lay not yet forgotten ne cared he greatly for her presence vain but turning said to trompart what foul blot is this to knight that lady should again depart to woods untouched & leave so proud disdain perdie said trompart let her pass at will lest by her presence danger mote befall for who can tell and sure i fear it ill but that she is some pour celestial for while she spoke her great words did a pall my feeble courage and my heart oppress that yet i quake and tremble over all and i said braggadocchio thought no less when first i herd her horn found with such ghastliness for from my mother's womb this grace i have me given by eternal destiny that earthly thing may not my courage brave dismay with fear or cause on foot to fly but either hellish fiends or powers on high which was the cause when erst that home i herd weening it had been thunder in the sky i hid my self from it as one afeard but when i other knew my self i boldly reared but now for fear of worse that may betide let us soon hence depart they soon agree so to his steed he god and gan to ride as one unfit therefore that all might see he had not trained be in chivalry which well that valiant courser did discern for he despised to tread in due degree but chafed and foamed with courage fierce and stern and to be eased of that base burden still did yearn cant. iiii guyon does furor bind in chains and stops occasion delivers phedon and therefore by strife is railed upon in brave pursuit of honourable deed there is i know not what great difference between the vulgar and the noble seed which unto things of valorous pretence seems to be born by native influence as feats of arms and love to entertain but chiefly skill to ride seems a science proper to gentle blood some others feign to manage steeds as did this vaunter but in vain but he the rightful owner of that steed who well could manage and subdue his pride the while on foot was forced for to yede with that black palmer his most trusty guide who suffered not his wandering feet to slide but when strong passion or weak fleshliness would from the right way seek to draw him wide he would through temperance and steadfastness teach him the weak to strengthen & the strong suppress it fortuned forth faring on his way he saw from far or seemed for to see some troublous uproar or contentious fray whereto he drew in haste it to agree a mad man or that feigned mad to be drew by the hair along upon the ground a handsome stripling with great cruelty whom soar he bet and gored with many a wound that cheeks with tears and sides with blood did all abound and him behind a wicked hag did stalk in ragged robes and filthy disarray her other leg was lame that she no'te walk but on a staff her feeble steps did stay her locks that loathly were and hoary grey grew all afore and loosely hung unrolled but all behind was bald and worn away that none thereof could ever taken hold and eke her face ill favoured full of wrinkles old and ever as she went her tongue did walk in foul reproach and terms of vile despite provoking him by her outrageous talk to heap more vengeance on that wretched wight sometime she reached him stones wherewith to smite sometime her staff though it her one leg were withouten which she could not go upright ne any evil means she did forbear that might him move to wrath and indignation rear the noble guyon moved with great remorse approaching first the hag did thrust away and after adding more impetuous force his mighty hands did on the madman lay and plucked him back who all on fire straight way against him turning all his fell intent with beastly brutish rage gan him assay and smote and bit and kicked and scratched and rend and did he wist not what in his avengement and sure he was a man of much might had he had governance it well to guide but when the frantic fit inflamed his spright his force was vain and struck more often wide then at the aimed mark which he had eyed and oft himself he chanced to hurt unwares while reason blended through passion nought descried but as a blindfold bull at random fares and where he hits nought knows & whom he hurts nought cares his rude assault and rugged handling strange seemed to the knight that aye with foe in fair defence and goodly managing of arms was wont to fight yet nathemore was he abashed now not fighting so but more enfierced through his currish play him sternly gripped and haling to and from to overthrow him strongly did assay but overthrew himself unwares and lower lay and being down the villain soar did beatrice and bruise with clownish fists his manly face and eke the hag with many a bitter threat still called upon to kill him in the place with whose reproach and odious menace the knight emmboiling in his haughty heart knit all his forces and gan soon unbrace his grasping hold so lightly did upstarted and drew his deadly weapon to maintain his part which when the palmer saw he loudly cried not so o guyon never think that so that monster can be mastered or destroyed he is not ah he is not such a foe as steel can wound or strength can overthrow that same is furor cursed cruel wight that unto knighthood works much shame and woe and that same hag his aged mother hight occasion the root of all wrath and despite with her who so will raging furor tame must first begin and well her amenage first her restrain from her reproachful blame and evil means with which she does enrage her frantic son and kindles his courage then when she is withdrawn or strong withstood it's eath his idle fury to assuage and calm the tempest of his passion wood the banks are overflown when stopped is the flood therewith sir guyon left his first emprise and turning to that woman fast her hent by the hoar locks that hung before her eyes and to the ground her threw yet nould she stent her bitter railing and foul revilement but still provoked her son to wreak her wrong but natheless he did her still torment and catching hold of her ungracious tonge thereon and iron lock did fasten firm and strong then when as use of speech was from her reft with her two crooked hands she signs did make and beckoned him the last help she had left but he that last left help away did take and both her hands fast bound unto a stake that she note stir then gan her son to fly full fast away and did her quite forsake but guyon after him in haste did high and soon him overtook in sad perplexity in his strong arms he stiffly him embraced who him gainstriving nought at all prevailed for all his power was utterly defaced and furious fits at erst quite weren quailed oft he reinforced and oft his forces failed yet yield he would not nor his rancour slack then him to ground he cast and rudely hailed and both his hands fast bound behind his back and both his feet in fetters to and iron rack with hundred iron chains he did him bind and hundred knots that did him soar constrain yet his great iron teeth he still did grind and grimly gnash threatening revenge in vain his burning eyes whom bloody strikes did stain stared full wide and threw forth sparks of fire and more for rank despite then for great pain shaked his long locks coloured like copper-wire and bit his tawny beard to show his raging ire thus when as guyon furor had captived turning about he saw that wretched squire whom that mad man of life nigh late deprived lying on ground all soiled with blood and mire whom when as he perceived to respire he gan to comfort and his wounds to dress being at last recured he gan inquire what hard mishap him brought to such distress and made that caitiff's thrall the thrall of wretchedness with heart then throbbing and with watery eyes fair sir quoth he what man can shun the hap that hidden lies unwares him to surprise misfortune waits advantage to entrap the man most wary in her whelming lap so me weak wretch of many weakest one unweeting and unware of such mishap she brought to mischief through occasion where this same wicked villain did me light upon it was a faithless squire that was the source of all my sorrow and of these sad tears with whom from tender dug of commune nurse atonce i was upbrought and eft when years more ripe us reason lent to chosen our pears our selves in league of vowed love we knit in which we long time without jealous fears or faulty thoughts continued as was fit and for my part i vow dissembled not a whit is was my fortune commune to that age to love a lady fair of great degree the which was born of noble parentage and set in highest seat of dignity yet seemed no less to love then loved to be long i her served and found her faithful still ne ever thing could cause us disagree love that two hearts makes one makes eke one will each strove to please and others pleasure to fulfil my friend hight philemon i did partake of all my love and all my privity who greatly joyous seemed for my sake and gracious to that lady as to me ne ever wight that mote so welcome be as he to her withouten blot or blame ne ever thing that she could think or see but unto him she would impart the same oh wretched man that would abuse so gentle dame at last such grace i found and means i wrought that i that lady to my spouse had won accord of friends consent of parents sought affiance made my happiness begun there wanted nought but few rites to be done which marriage make that day too far did seem most joyous man on whom the shining sun did show his face my self i did esteem and that my falser friend did no less joyous deem but ere that wished day his beam disclosed he either envying my towards good or of himself to treason ill disposed one day unto me came in friendly mood and told for secret how he understood that lady whom i had to me assigned had both distained her honourable blood and eke the faith which she to me did bind and therefore wished me stay till i more truth should find the gnawing anguish and sharp jealousy which his sad speech infixed in my breast rankled so soar and festered inwardly that my engrieved mind could find no rest till that the truth thereof i did outwrest and him besought by that same sacred band betwixt us both to counsel me the best he then with solemn oath and plighted hand assured ere long the truth to let me understand ere long with like again he boarded me saying he now had bolted all the flower and that it was a groom of base degree which of my love was partner paramour who used in a darksome inner bower her oft to meet which better to approve he promised to bring me at that hour when i should see that would me nearer move and driven me to withdraw my blind abused love this graceless man for furtherance of his guile did court the handmaid of my lady deer who glad embosomed his affection vile did all she might more pleasing to appear one day to work her to his will more near he wooed her thus pryene so she hight what great despite does fortune to thee bear thus lowly to abase thy beauty bright that it should not deface all others lesser light but if she had her least help to thee lent adorn thy form according thy desert their blazing pride thou wouldst soon have blended and stained their praises with thy least good part ne should fair claribell with all her art though she thy lady be approach thee near for proof thereof this evening as thou art array thy self in her most gorgeous gear that i may more delight in thy embracement deer the maiden proud through praise and mad through love him hearkened to and soon her self arrayed the while to me the traitor did remove his crafty engine and as he had said me leading in a secret corner laid the sad spectator of my tragedy where left he went and his own false part played disguised like that groom of base degree whom he had feigned th'abuser of my love to be eftsoones he came unto appointed place and with him brought priene rich arrayed in claribellaes clothes her proper face i not discerned in that darksome shade but weened it was my love with whom he played ah god what horror and tormenting grief my heart my hands mine eyes and all assayed me liefer were ten thousand deaths proof then wound of jealous worm and shame of such reprieve i home returning fraught with fowl despite and chawing vengeance all the way i went soon as my loathed love appeared in sighed with wrathful hand i slew her innocent that after soon i dearly did lament for when the cause of that outrageous deed demanded i made plain and evident her faulty handmaid which that bale did breed confessed how philemon her wrought to change her weed which when i herd with horrible affright and hellish fury all enraged i sought upon my self that vengeable despite to punish yet it better first i thought to wreak my wrath on him that first it wrought to philemon false faitour philemon i cast to pay that i so dearly bought of deadly drugs i gave him drink anon and washed away his guilt with guilty potion thus heaping crime on crime and grief on grief to loss of love adjoining loss of friend i meant to purge both with a third mischief and in my woes beginner it to end that was pryene she did first offend she last should smart with which cruel intent when i at her my murderous blade did bend she fled away with ghastly dreariment and i pursuing my fell purpose after went fear gave her wings and rage inforced my flight through woods and plains so long i did her chase till this mad man whom your victorious might hath now fast bound me met in middle space as i her so he me pursued apace and shortly overtook i breathing ire soar chafed at my stay in such a case and with my heat kindled his cruel fire which kindled once his mother did more rage inspire betwixt them both they have me done to die through wounds & strokes & stubborn handling that death were better then such agony as grief and fury unto me did bring of which in me yet sticks the mortal sting that during life will never be appeased when he thus ended had his sorrowing said guyon squire soar have you been diseased but all your hurts may soon through temperance be eased then gan the palmer thus most wretched man that to affections does the bridle lend in their beginning they are weak and wan but soon through sufferance grow to fearful end while they are weak betimes with them contend for when they once to perfect strength do grow strong wars they make and cruel battery bend gainst fort of reason it to overthrow wrath jealousy grief love this squire have laid thus low wrath jealousy grief love do thus expel wrath is a fire and jealousy a weed grief is a flood and love a monster fell the fire of sparks the weed of little seed the flood of drops the monster filth did breed but sparks seed drops and filth do thus delay the sparks soon quench the springing seed outweed the drops dry up and filth wipe clean away so shall wrath jealousy grief love die and decay unlucky squire said guyon sith thou hast fallen unto mischief through intemperance henceforth take heed of that thou now hast passed and guide thy ways with wary governance lest worse betide thee by some later chance but read how art thou named and of what kin phedon i hight quoth he and do advance mine ancestry from famous coradin who first to raise our house to honour did begin thus as he spoke lo far away they spied a varlet running towards hastily whose flying feet so fast their way applied that round about a cloud of dust did fly which mingled all with sweat did dim his eye he soon approached panting breathless hot and all so soiled that none could him descry his countenance was bold and bashed not for guyons looks but scornful eye-glance at him shot behind his back he boar a brazen shield on which was drawn fair in colours fit a flaming fire in midst of bloody field and round about the wreathe this word was writ burned i do burn right well beseemed it to be the shield of some redoubted knight and in his hand two darts exceeding flit and deadly sharp he held whose heads were dight in poison and in blood of malice and despite when he in presence came to guyon first he boldly spoke sir knight if knight thou be abandon this before stalled place at erst for fear of further harm i counsel thee or bide the chance at thine own jeopardy the knight at his great boldness wondered and though he scorned his idle vanity yet mildly him to purpose answered for not to grow of nought he it conjectured varlet this place most due to me i deem yielded by him that held it forcibly but whence should come that harm which thou dost seem to threat to him that minds his chance aby perdy said he here comes and is hard by a knight of wondrous pour and great assay that never yet encountered enemy but did him deadly daunt or fowl dismay ne thou for better hope if thou his presence stay how hight he then said guyon and from whence pyrrhochles is his name renowned far for his bold feats and hardy confidence full oft approved in many a cruel war the brother of cymochles both which are the sons of old acrates and despite acrates son of phlegeton and jar but phlegeton is son of herebus and night but herebus son of eternity is hight so from immortal raze he does proceed that mortal hands may not withstand his might dread for his derring do and bloody deed for all in blood and spoil is his delight his am i atin his in wrong and right that matter make for him to work upon and stir him up to strife and cruel fight fly therefore fly this fearful stead anon lest thy foolhardize work thy sad confusion his be that care whom most it does concern said he but whither with such hasty flight art thou now bound for well mote i discern great cause that carries thee so swift and light my lord quoth he me sent and straight behight to seek occasion where so she be for he is all disposed to bloody fight and breathes out wrath and heinous cruelty hard is his hap that first falls in his jeopardy madman said then the palmer that does seek occasion to wrath and cause of strife she comes unsought and shunned follows eke happy who can abstain when rancour rife kindles revenge and threats his rusty knife woe never wants where every cause is caught and rash occasion makes unquiet life then lo where bound she fits whom thou hast sought said guyon let that message to thy lord be brought that when the varlet herd and saw straight way he waxed wondrous wroth and said vile knight that knights & knighthood dost with shame upbray and showest th'enfample of thy childish migbt with silly weak old woman thus to fight great glory and gay spoil sure hast thou god and stoutly proved thy puissance here in sighed that shall pyrrhochles well requite i wot and with thy blood abolish so reproachful blot with that one of his thrillant darts he threw headed with ire and vengeable despite the quivering steel his aimed end well knew and to his breast it self intended right but he was wary and ere it empight in the meant mark advanced his shield atween on which it seizing no way enter might but back rebounding left the forkhead keen eftsoons he fled away and might no where be seen cant. v. pyrrhochles does with guyon fight and furors chain unbinds of whom soar hurt for his revenge attin gymochles finds who ever does to temperance apply his steadfast life and all his actions frame trust me shall find no greater enemy then stubborn perturbation to the same to which right well the wise do give that name for it the goodly peace of stayed minds does overthrow and troublous war proclaim his own woes author who so bound it finds as did pyrrhochles and it wilfully unbinds after that varlets flight it was not long ere on the plain fast pricking guyon spied one in bright arms embattled full strong that as the sunny beams do glance and glide upon the trembling wave so shined bright and round about him threw forth sparkling fire that seemed him to inflame on every side his steed was bloody read and fomedire when with the mastering spur he did him roughly stir approaching nigh he never stayed to greet ne chaffer words proud courage to provoke but pricked so flers that underneath his feet the smouldering dust did round about him smoke both horse and man nigh able for to choke and fairly couching his steelheaded spear him first saluted with a sturdy stroke it booted nought sir guyon coming near to think such hideous puissance on foot to bear but lightly shunned it and passing by with his bright blade did smite at him so fell that the sharp steel arriving forcibly on his braod shield bit not but glancing fell on his horse neck before the quilted fell and from the head the body sundered quite so him dismounted low he did compel on foot with him to matchen equal fight the trunked beast fast bleeding did him foully dight soar bruised with the fallen he slow uprose and all enraged thus him loudly shent disleall knight whose coward courage chosen to wreak it self on beast all innocent and shunned the mark at which it should be meant thereby thine arms seem strong but manhood frail so hast thou oft with guile thine honour blended but little may such guile thee now avail if wonted force and fortune do not much me fail with that he drew his flaming sword and struck at him so fiercely that the upper marge of his seuenfolded shield away it took and glancing on his helmet made a large and open gash therein were not his targe that broke the violence of his intent the weary soul from thence it would discharge natheless so soar a buff to him it lent that made him reel and to his breast his beaver bent exceeding wroth was guyon at that blow and much ashamed that stroke of living arm should him dismay and make him stoup so low though otherwise it did him little harm though hurling high his iron braced arm he smote so manly on his shoulder plate that all his left side it did quite disarm yet there the steel stayed not but inly bore deep in his flesh and opened wide a read floodgate deadly dismayed with horror of that dint pyrrhochles was and grieved eke entire yet nathemore did it his fury stint but added flame unto his former fire that wellnigh melted his heart in raging ire ne thenceforth his approved skill to ward or strike or hurl round in warelike gyre remembered he ne cared for his safeguard but rudely raged and like a cruel tiger fared he hewed and lashed and foined and thundered blows and every way did seek into his life ne plate ne male could ward so mighty throws but yielded passage to his cruel knife but guyon in the heat of all his strife was wary wise and closely did await advantage whilst his foe did rage most rife sometime a thwart sometime he struck him strait and falsed oft his blows illude him with such bait like as a lion whose imperial pour a proud rebellious unicorn defies t'auoide the rash assault and wrathful stour of his fierce foe him to a tree applies and when him running in full course he spies he slips aside the while that furious beast his precious horn sought of his enemies strikes in the stock ne thence can be relast but to the mighty victor yields a bounteous feast with such fair slight him guyon often failed till at the last all breathless weary faint him spying with fresh onset he assailed and kindling new his courage seeming quaint struck him so hugely that through great constraint he made him stoup perforce unto his knee and do unwilling worship to the saint that on his shield depainted he did see such homage till that instant never learned he whom guyon seeing stoup pursued fast the present offer of fair victory and soon his dreadful blade about he cast wherewith he smote his haughty crest so high that straight on ground made him full low to lie then on his breast his victor foot he thrust with that he cried mercy do me not die ne deem thy force by fortune's doom unjust that hath maugre her spite thus low me laid in dust eftsoones his cruel hand sir guyon stayed tempering the passion with advisement slow and mastering might on enemy dismayed for equal die of war he well did know then to him said live and allegiance owe to him that gives thee life and liberty and henceforth by this days ensample trow that hasty wroth and heedless hazardry do breed repentance late and lasting infamy so up he let him rise who with grim look and countenance stern upstanding gan to grind his grated teeth for great disdain and shook his sandy locks long hanging down behind knotted in blood and dust for grief of mind that he in ods of arms was conquered yet in himself some comfort he did find that him so noble knight had mastered whose bounty more then might yet both he wondered which guyon marking said be nought aggrieved sir knight that thus you now subdued are was never man who most conquests achieved but sometime had the worse and lost by war yet shortly gained that loss exceeded far loss is no shame nor to be less then foe but to be lesser then himself does mar both losers' lot and victor's praise also vain others overthrows who self does overthrown fly oh pyrrhochles fly the dreadful war that in thy self thy lesser parts do move outrageous anger and woe-working jar direful impatience and heart murdering love those those thy foes those warriors far remove which thee to endless bale captived led but sith in might thou didst my mercy prove of courtesy to me the cause a read that thee against me drew with so impetuous dread dreadless said he that shall i soon declare it was complained that thou hadst done great tort unto and aged woman poor and bore and thralled her in chains with strong effort void of all succour and needful comfort that ill beseems thee such as i thee see to work such shame therefore i thee exhort to change thy will and set occasion free and to her captive son yield his first liberty thereat sir guyon smiled and is that all said he that thee so soar displeased hath great mercy sure for to enlarge a thrall whose freedom shall thee turn to greatest scathe natheless now quench thy hot emmboiling wrath lo there they be to thee i yield them free thereat he wondrous glad out of the path did lightly leap where he them bound did see and gan to break the bans of their captivity soon as occasion felt her self untied before her son could well assoiled be she to her use returned and straight defied both guyon and pyrrhochles th'one said he because he won the other because he was won so matter did she make of nought to stir up strife and do them disagree but soon as furor was enlarged she sought to kindle his quenched fire and thousand causes wrought it was not long ere she inflamed him so that he would algates with pyrrhochles fight and his redeemer challenged for his foe because he had not well maintained his right but yielded had to that same stranger knight now gan pyrrhochles wex as wood as he and him affronted with impatient might so both together fierce engrasped be while guyon standing by their uncouth strife does see him all that while occasion did provoke against pyrrhochles and new matter framed upon the old him stirring to be wreaked of his late wrongs in which she oft him blamed for suffering such abuse as knighthood shamed and him disabled quite but he was wise ne would with vain occasions be inflamed yet others she more urgent did devise yet nothing could him to impatience entice their fell contention still increased more and more thereby increased furors might that he his foe has hurt and wounded soar and him in blood and dirt deformed quite his mother eke more to augment his spite now brought to him a flaming fire brand which she in stygian lake ay burning bright had kindled that she gave into his hound that armed with fire more hardly he mote him withstand tho gan that villain wex so fierce and strong that nothing might sustain his furious force he cast him down to ground and all along drew him through dirt and mire without remorse and foully battered his comely corpse that guyon much disdained so loathly sighed at last he was compelled to cry perforce help o sir guyon help most noble knight to rid a wretched man from hands of hellish wight the knight was greatly moved at his plaint and gan him dight to succour his distress till that the palmer by his graven restraint him stayed from yielding pitiful redress and said dear son thy causeless ruth repress ne let thy stout heart melt in pity vain he that his sorrow sought through wilfulness and his foe fettered would release again deserves to taste his follies fruit repented pain guyon obeyed so him away he drew from needless trouble of renewing fight already fought his voyage to pursue but rash pyrrhochles varlet atin hight when late he saw his lord in heavy plighted under sir guyons puissant stroke to fallen him deeming dead as then he seemed in sighed fled fast away to tell his funeral unto his brother whom cymochles men did call he was a man of rare redoubted might famous throughout the world for warlike praise and glorious spoils purchased in perilous fight full many doughty knights he in his days had done to death subdued in equal frays whose carcases for terror of his name of fowls and beasts he made the piteous prays and hung their conquered arms for more defame on gallow trees in honour of his dearest dame his dearest dame is that enchantress the vile acrasia that with vain delights and idle pleasures in his bower of bliss does charm her lovers and the feeble sprights can call out of the bodies of frail wights whom then she does transform to monstrous hues and horribly mishaps with ugly sights captived eternally in iron mews and darksome dens where titan his face never shows there atin found cymochles sojourning to serve his leman's love for he by kind was given all to lust and lose living when ever his fierce hands he free mote find and now he has poured out his idle mind in dainty delices and lavish joys having his warlike weapons cast behind and flows in pleasures and vain pleasing toys mingled amongst lose ladies and lascivious boys and over him art striving to compare with nature did and arbour green dispread framed of wanton ivy flowering fair through which the fragrant eglantine did spread his pricking arms entrailed with roses read which dainty odours round about them threw and all within with flowers was garnished that when mild zephyrus amongst them blew did breath out bounteous smells & painted colours show and fast beside there trickled softly down a gentle stream whose murmuring wave did play amongst the pumy stones and made a sown to lull him soft a sleep that by it lay the weary traveller wandering that way therein did often quench his thirsty heat and then by it his weary limbs display while creeping slumber made him to forget his former pain and wiped away his toilsome sweat and on the other side a pleasant grove was shot up high full of the stately tree that dedicated is t'olympicke ioue and to his son alcides whenas he gained in nemea goodly victory therein the merry birds of every sort chanted aloud their cheerful harmony and made amongst them selves a sweet consort that quickened the dull spright with musical comfort there he him found all carelessly displayed in secret shadow from the sunny ray on a sweet bed of lilies softly laid amid a flock of damsels fresh and gay that round about him dissolute did play their wanton follies and light merriment every of which did loosely disarray her upper parts of meet habiliments and showed them naked decked with many ornaments and every of them strove with most delights him to aggrate and greatest pleasures show some framed fair looks glancing like evening lights others sweet words dropping like honey due some bathed kisses and did soft embrew the sugared liquour through his melting lips one boasts her beauty and does yield to view her dainty limbs above her tender hips another her out boasts and all for trial strips he like and adder lurking in the weeds his wandering thought in deep desire does steep and his frail eye with spoil of beauty feeds sometime he falsely feigns himself to sleep while through their lids his wanton eyes do peep to steal a snatch of amorous conceit whereby close fire into his heart does creep so he them deceives deceived in his deceit made drunk with drugs of deer voluptuous receipt atin arriving there when him he spied thus in still waves of deep delight to wade fiercely approaching to him loudly cried cymochles o no but cymochles shade in which that manly person late did fade what is become of great acrates son or where hath he hung up his mortal blade that hath so many haughty conquests won is all his force forlorn and all his glory done then pricking him with his sharp-pointed dart he said up up thou womanish weak knight that here in ladies lap entombed art unmindful of thy praise and prowest might and weetless eke of lately wrought despite while sad pyrrhochles lies on senseless ground and groans out his utmost grudging spright through many a stroke & many a streaming wound calling thy help in vain that here in joys art drowned suddenly out of his delightful dream the man awoke and would have questioned more but he would not endure that woeful theme for to dilate at large but urged soar with piercing words and pitiful implore him hasty to arise as one affright with hellish fiends or furies mad uproar he then uprose inflamed with fell despite and called for his arms for he would algates fight they be brought he quickly does him dight and lightly mounted passes on his way ne ladies loves ne sweet entreaties might appease his heat or hasty passage stay for he has vowed to been avenged that day that day it self him seemed all too long on him that did pyrrhochles deer dismay so proudly pricks on his courser strong and atin aye him pricks with spurs of shame & wrong cant. vi guyon is of immodest mirth led into lose desire fights with cymochles while his brother burns infurious fire a harder lesson to learn continence in joyous pleasure then in grievous pain for sweetness does allure the weaker sense so strongly that uneathes it can refrain from that which feeble nature covets feign but grief and wrath that be her enemies and foes of life she better can restrain yet virtue vaunts in both their victories and guyon in them all shows goodly masteries whom bold cymochles travelling to find with cruel purpose bent to wreak on him the wrath which atin kindled in his mind came to a river by whose utmost brim waiting to pass he saw whereas did swim a long the shore as swift as glance of eye a little gondelay bedecked trim with boughs and arbours woven cunningly that like a little forest seemed outwardly and therein sat a lady fresh and fair making sweet solace to her self alone sometime she sung as loud as lark in air sometime she laughed that nigh her breath was gone yet was there not with her else any one that might to her move cause of merriment matter of mirth enough though there were none she could devise and thousand ways invent to feed her foolish humour and vain jolliment which when far off cymochles herd and saw he loudly called to such as were a board the little bark unto the shore to draw and him to ferry over that deep ford the merry mariner unto his word soon hearkened and her painted boat straightway turned to the shore where that same warlike lord she in received but atin by no way she would admit albe the knight her much did pray eftsoones her shallow ship away did slide more swift then swallow shear the liquid sky withouten oar or pilot it to guide or winged canvas with the wind to fly only she turned a pin and by and by it cut away upon the yielding wave ne cared she her course for to apply for it was taught the way which she would have and both from rocks and flats it self could wisely save and all the way the wanton damosel found new mirth her passenger to entertain for she in pleasant purpose did abound and greatly joyed merry tales to feign of which a storehouse did with her remain yet seemed nothing well they her became for all her words she drowned with laughter vain and wanted grace in uttering of the same that turned all her pleasance to a scoffing game and other while vain toys she would devise as her fantastic wit did most delight sometime her head she fondly would aguize with gaudy girlands or fresh flowrets dight about her neck or rings of rushes plighted sometime to do him laugh she would assay to laugh at shaking of the leaves light or to behold the water work and play about her little frigate therein making way her light behaviour and lose dalliance gave wondrous great contentment to the knight that of his way he had no sovenance nor care of vowed revenge and cruel fight but to weak wench did yield his martial might so easy was to quench his flamed mind with one sweet drop of sensual delight so easy is t'appease the stormy wind of malice in the calm of pleasant womankind diverse discourses in their way they spent amongst which cymochles of her questioned both what she was and what that usage meant which in her cot she daily practised vain man said she that wouldst be reckoned a stranger in thy home and ignorant of phaedria for so my name is read of phaedria thine own fellow servant for thou to serve acrasia thy self dost vaunt in this wide inland sea that hight by name the idle lake my wandering ship i row that knows her port and thither sails by aim ne care ne fear i how the wind do blow or whither swift i weened or whither slow both slow and swift a like do serve my turn ne swelling neptune ne loud thundering ioue can change my cheer or make me ever mourn my little boat can safely pass this perilous bourn while thus she talked and while thus she toyed they were far passed the passage which he spoke and come unto and island waste and void that floated in the midst of that great lake there her small gondelay her port did make and that gay pair issuing on the shore disburdued her their way they forward take into the land that lay them fair before whose pleasance she him showed and plentiful great store it was a chosen plot of fertile land amongst wide waves set like a little nest as if it had by nature's cunning hand be choicely picked out from all the rest and laid forth for ensample of the best no dainty flower or herb that grows on ground no arboret with painted blossoms dressed and smelling sweet but there it might be found to bud out fair and her sweet smells throw all around no tree whose branches did not bravely spring no branch whereon a fine bird did not fit no bird but did her shrill notes sweetly sing no song but did contain a lovely dit trees branches birds and songs were framed fit for to allure frail mind to careless ease careless the man soon wox and his weak wit was overcome of thing that did him please so pleased did his wrathful purpose fair appease thus when she had his eyes and senses fed with false delights and filled with pleasures vain into a shady dale she soft him led and laid him down upon a grassy plain and her sweet self without dread or disdain she set beside laying his head disarmed in her lose lap it softly to sustain where soon he slumbered fearing not be harmed the while with a loud lay she thus him sweetly charmed behold o man that toilsome pains dost take the flowers the fields and all that pleasant grows how they themselves do thine ensample make while nothing envious nature them forth throws out of her fruitful lap how no man knows they spring they bud they blossom fresh and fair and deck the world with their rich pompous shows yet no man for them takes pains or care yet no man to them can his careful pains compare the lily lady of the flowering field the flower-de-luce her lovely paramour bid thee to them thy fruitless labours yield and soon leave off this toilsome weary stour lo lo how brave she decks her bounteous bower with silken curtains and gold coverlets therein to shroud her sumptuous belamour yet neither spins nor cards ne cares nor frets but to her mother nature all her care she lets why then dost thou o man that of them all art lord and eke of nature sovereign wilfully make thy self a wretched thrall and wast thy joyous hours in needless pain seeking for danger and adventures vain what boots it all to have and nothing use who shall him rew that swimming in the main will die for thirst and water does refuse refuse such fruitless toil and present pleasures choose by this she had him lulled fast a sleep that of no worldly thing he care did take then she with liquours strong his eyes did steep that nothing should him hastily awake so she him left and did her self betake unto her boat again with which she cleft the slothful wave of that great grisly lake soon she that island far behind her left and now is come to that same place where first she wove by this time was the worthy guyon brought unto the other side of that wide strand where she was rowing and for passage sought him needed not long call she soon to hound her ferry brought where him she biding found with his sad guide himself she took a board but the black palmer suffered still to stand ne would for price or prayers once afford to ferry that old man over the perilous ford guyon was loath to leave his guide behind yet being entered might not back retire for the flit bark obeying to her mind forth launched quickly as she did desire ne gave him leave to bid that aged fire adieu but nimbly ran her wonted course through the dull billows thick as troubled mire whom neither wind out of their seat could force nor timely tides did driven out of their sluggish source and by the way as was her wonted guise her merry fit she freshly gan to rear and did of joy and jollity devise her self to cherish and her guest to cheer the knight was courteous and did not forbear her honest mirth and pleasance to partake but when he saw her toy and gibe and gear and pass the bonds of modest merrymake her dalliance he despised and follies did forsake yet she still followed her former style and said and did all that mote him delight till they arrived in that pleasant i'll where sleeping late she left her other knight but when as guyon that land had sighed he wist himself amiss and angry said ah dame perdy you have not done me right thus to mislead me while i you obeyed me little needed from my right way to have strayed fair sir quoth she be not displeased at all who fares on sea may not command his way ne wind and weather at his pleasure call the sea is wide and easy for to stray the wind unstable and does never stay but here a while you may in safety rest till season serve new passage to assay better safe port then be in seas distressed therewith she laughed and did her earnest end in jest but he half discontent mote natheless himself appease and issued forth on shore the joys whereof and happy fruitfulness such as he saw she gan him lay before and all though pleasant yet she made much more the fields did laugh the flowers did freshly spring the trees did bud and early blossoms boar and all the choir of birds did sweetly sing and told that gardens pleasures in their caroling and she more sweet then any bird on bough would oftentimes amongst them bear a part and strive to pass as she could well enough their native music by her skilful art so did she all that might his constant heart withdraw from thought of warlike enterprise and drown in dissolute delights apart where noise of arms or view of martial guise might not revive desire of knightly exercise but he was wife and wary of her will and ever held his hand upon his heart yet would not seem so rude and thewed ill as to despise so courteous seeming part that gentle lady did to him impart but fairly tempering found desire subdued and ever her desired to depart she list not hear but her disports pursued and ever bade him stay till time the tide renewed and now by this cymochles hour was spent that he awoke out of his idle dream and shaking off his drowzy dreariment gan him avise how ill did him beseem in slothful sleep his melted heart to steam and quench the brand of his conceived ire tho up he started stirred with shame extreme ne stayed for his damosel to inquire but marched to the strand their passage to require and in the way he with sir guyon met accompanied with phaedria the fair eftsoons he gan to rage and inly fret crying let be that lady debonair thou recreant knight and soon thy self prepare to battle if thou mean her love to gain lo lo already how the fowls in air do flock awaiting shortly to obtain thy carcase for their prey the guerdon of thy pain and therewithal he fiercely at him flew and with importance outrage him assailed who soon prepared to field his sword forth drew and him with equal valve countervailed their mighty strokes their habergeons dismailed and naked made each others manly spalls the mortal steel despiteously entailed deep in their flesh quite through the iron walls that a large purple stream a down their giambeux falls cymochles that had never met before so puissant foe with envious despite his proud presumed force increased more disdaining to be held so long in fight sir guyon grudging not so much his might as those unknightly railings which he spoke with wrathful fire his courage kindled bright thereof devising shortly to be wreaked and doubling all his powers redoubled every stroke both of them high atonce their hands enhanced and both atonce their huge blows down did sway cymochles sword on guyons shield glanced and thereof nigh one quarter shore away but guyons angry blade so fierce did play on th'others helmet which as titan shone that quite it clove his plumed crest in tway and bared all his head unto the bone wherewith astonished still he stood as senseless stone still as he stood fair phaedria that beheld that deadly danger soon atween them ran and at their feet her self most humbly felled crying with piteous voice and countenance wan ah well away most noble lords how can your cruel eyes endure so piteous sighed to shed your lives on ground woe worth the man that first did teach the oursed steel to bite in his own flesh and make way to the living spright if ever love of lady did empierce your iron breasts or pity could find place withhold your bloody hands from battle fierce and sith for me you fight to me this grace both yield to stay your deadly strife a space they stayed a while and forth she gan proceed most wretched woman and of wicked raze that am the author of this heinous deed and cause of death between two doughty knights do breed but if for me you fight or me will serve not this rude kind of battle nor these arms are meet the which do men in bale to starve and doleful sorrow heap with deadly harms such cruel game my skirmishes disarms another war and other weapons i do love where love does give his sweet alarms without bloodshed and where the enemy does yield unto his foe a pleasant victory debateful strife and cruel enmity the famous name of knighthood foully shent but lovely peace and gentle amity and in amours the passing hours to spend the mighty martial hands do most commend of love they ever greater glory boar then of their arms mars is cupidoes friend and is for venus loves renowned more then all his wars and spoils the which he did of yore therewith she sweetly smiled they though full bent to prove extremities of bloody fight yet at her speech their rages gan relent and calm the sea of their tempestuous spite such pour have pleasing words such is the might of courteous clemency in gentle heart now after all was ceased the fairy knight besought that damosel suffer him depart and yield him ready passage to that other part she no less glad then he desirous was of his departure thence for of her joy and vain delight she saw he light did pass a foe of folly and immodest toy still solemn sad or still disdainful coy delighting all in arms and cruel war that her sweet peace and pleasures did annoy troubled with terror and unquiet jar that she well pleased was thence to amove him far tho him she brought aboard and her swift boat forthwith directed to that further strand the which on the dull waves did lightly float and soon arrived on the shallow sand where gladsome guyon sallied forth to land and to that damosel thanks gave for reward upon that shore he spied atin stand thereby his master left when late he fared in phadrias flit bark over that perilous shared well could he him remember sith of late he with pyrrhochles sharp debatement made straight gan he him revile and bitter rate as shepherds cur that in dark evening's shade hath tracted forth some salvage beasts trade vile miscreant said he whither dost thou fly the shame and death which will thee soon invade what coward hand shall do thee next to die that art thus foully fled from famous enemy with that he stiffly shook his steelhead dart but sober guyon hearing him so rail though somewhat moved in his mighty heart yet with strong reason mastered passion frail and passed fairly forth he turning tail back to the strand retired and there still stayed awaiting passage which him late did fail the while cymochles with that wanton maid the hasty heat of his avowed revenge delayed whilst there the varlet stood he saw from far and armed knight that towards him fast ran he ran on foot as if in luckless war his forlorn steed from him the victourwan he seemed breathless heartless faint and wan and all his armour sprinkled was with blood and soiled with dirty gore that no man can discern the hew thereof he never stood but bent his hasty course towards the idle flood the varlet saw when to the flood he came how without stop or stay he fiercely leapt and deep him self beduked in the same that in the lake his lofty crest was steeped ne of his safety seemed care he kept but with his raging arms he rudely flashed the waves about and all his armour swept that all the blood and filth away was washed yet still he bet the water and the billows dashed atin drew nigh to weet what it mote be for much he wondered at that uncouth sighed whom should he but his own deer lord there see his own deer lord pyrrhochles in sad plighted ready to drown himself for fell despite harrow now out and well away he cried what dismal day hath lent this cursed light to see my lord so deadly damnified pyrrhochles o pyrrhochles what is thee betide i burn i burn i burn then loud he cried oh how i burn with implacable fire yet nought can quench mine inly flaming side nor sea of liquour cold nor lake of mire nothing but death can do me to respire ah be it said he from pyrrhochles far after pursuing death once to require or think that ought those puissant hands may mar death is for wretches born under unhappy star perdie then is it fit for me said he that am i ween most wretched man alive but in flames yet no flames can i see and dying daily daily yet revive oh atin help to me last death to give the varlet at his plaint was grieved so soar that his deep wounded heart in two did rive and his own health remembering now no more did follow that ensample which he blamed afore into the lake he leapt his lord to aid so love the dread of danger does despise and of him catching hold him strongly stayed from drowning but more happy he then wise of that seas nature did him not avise the waves thereof so slow and sluggish were engrossed with mud which did them foul agrise that every weighty thing they did upbear ne ought mote ever sink down to the bottom there while thus they struggled in that idle wave and strove in vain the one himself to drown the other both from drowning for to save lo to that shore one in and ancient gown whose hoary locks great gravity did crown holding in hand a goodly arming sword by fortune came led with the troublous sown where drenched deep he found in that dull ford the careful servant striving with his raging lord him atin spying knew right well of yore and loudly called help help o archimage to save my lord in wretched plighted forlore help with thy hand or with thy counsel sage weak hands but counsel is most strong in age him when the old man saw he wondered soar to see pyrrhochles there so rudely rage yet since help he saw he needed more then pity he in haste approached to the shore and called pyrrhochles what is this i see what hellish fury hath at erst thee hent furious ever i thee knew to be yet never in this strange astonishment these flames these flames he cried doe metorment what flames quoth he when i thee present see in danger rather to be drowned then brent harrow the flames which me consume said he ne can be quenched within my secret bowels be that cursed man that cruel fiend of hell furor o furor hath me thus bedight his deadly wounds within my livers swell and his hot fire burns in mine entrails bright kindled through his infernal brand of spite sith late with him i battle vain would boast that now i ween ioues dreaded thunder light does scorch not half so soar nor damned ghost in flaming phlegeton does not so felly roast which when as archimago herd his grief he knew right well and him atonce disarmed then searched his secret wounds and made a proof of every place that was with bruising harmed or with the hidden fire too inly warmed which done he balms and herbs thereto applied and euemore with mighty spells them charmed that in short space he has them qualified and him restored to health that would have algates died cant. vii guyon finds mamon in a delve sunning his treasure hoar is by him tempted & led down to see his secret store as pilot well expert in perilous wave that to a steadfast star his course hath bent when foggy mists or cloudy tempests have the faithful light of that fair lamp blinded and covered heaven with hideous dreariment upon his carded and compass firms his eye the masters of his long experiment and to them does the steady helm apply bidding his winged vessel fairly forward fly so guyon having lost his trusty guide late left beyond that idle lake proceeds yet on his way of none accompanied and evermore himself with comfort feeds of his own virtues and praiseworthy deeds so long he yode yet no adventure found which fame of her shrill trumpet worthy redes for still he traveled through wide wasteful ground that nought but desert wilderness showed all around at last he came unto a gloomy glade covered with boughs & shrubs from heavens light whereas he sitting found in secret shade and uncouth salvage and vnciulle wight of grisly hew and fowl ill favoured sighed his face with smoke was tanned and eyes were bleared his head and beard with soot were ill bedight his coalblack hands did seem to have been seared in smith's fire-spitting forge and nails like claws appeared his iron coat all overgrown with rust was underneath enveloped with gold whose glistering gloss darkened with filthy dust well it appeared to have been of old a work of rich entail and curious mould woven with antics and wild imagery and in his lap a mass of coin he told and turned upsidedown to feed his eye a covetous desire with his huge treasury and round about him lay on every side great heaps of gold that never could be spent of which some were rude our not purified of mulcibers devouring element some others were new driven and distented into great ingos and to wedges square some in round plataeae withouten monument but most were stamped and in their metal bore the antique shapes of kings and caesars strange & rare soon as he guyon saw in great affright and haste he rose for to remove aside those precious hills from strangers envious sighed and down them poured through and hold full wide into the hollow earth them there to hide but guyon lightly to him leaping stayed his hand that trembled as one terrified and though him self were at the sighed dismayed yet him perforce restrained and to him doubtful said what art thou man if man at all thou art that here in desert hast thine habitance and these rich heaps of wealth dost hide apart from the world's eye and from her right usance thereat with staring eyes fixed askance in great disdain he answered hardy elf that darest view my direful countenance i read thee rash and heedless of thy self to trouble my still seat and heaps of precious pelf god of the world and worldlings i me call great mammon greatest god below the sky that of my plenty pour out unto all and unto none my graces do envy riches renown and principality honour estate and all this world's good for which men swink and sweat incessantly from me do flow into and ample flood and in the hollow earth have their eternal brood wherefore if me thou deign to serve and sew at thy command lo all these mountains be or if to thy great mind or greedy view all these may not suffice there shall to thee ten times so much be numbered frank and free mammon said he thy godhead's vaunt is vain and idle offers of thy golden fee to them that covet such eye-glutting gain proffer thy gifts and fitter servants entertain me ill besits that in der-doing arms and honours suit my vowed days do spend unto thy bounteous baits and pleasing charms with which weak men thou witchest to attend regard of worldly muck does foully blend and low abase the high heroic spright that joys for crowns and kingdoms to contend fair shields gay steeds bright arms be my delight those be the riches fit for and adventurous knight vain glorious elf said he dost not thou weet that money can thy wants at will supply sheilds steeds and arms & all things for thee meet it can purvey in twinkling of and eye and crowns and kingdoms to thee multiply do not i kings create throw the crown sometime to him that low in dust does lie and him that reigned into his room thrust down and whom i lust do heap with glory and renown all otherwise said he i riches read and deem them root of all disquietness first god with guile and then preserved with dread and after spent with pride and lavishness leaving behind them grief and heaviness infinite mischiefs of them do arise strife and debate bloodshed and bitterness outrageous wrong and hellish covetise that noble heart as great dishonour does despise ne thine be kingdoms ne the sceptres thine but realms and rulers thou dost both confound and loyal truth to treason dost incline witness the guiltless blood poured oft on ground the crowned often slain the slayer crowned the sacred diadem in pieces rend and purple robe gored with many a wound castles surprised great cities sacked and brent so makest thou kings & gainest wrongful government long were to tell the troublous storms that toss the private state and make the life unsweet who swelling sails in caspian sea does cross and in frail wood on adrian gulf does fleet does not i ween so many evils meet then mammon wexing wroth and why then said are mortal men so found and undiscreet so evil thing to seek unto their aid and having not complain and having it upbraid indeed quoth he through fowl intemperance frail men are oft captived to covetise but would they think with how small allowance untroubled nature does her self suffice such superfluities they would despise which with sad cares impeach our native joys at the well head the purest streams arise but mucky filth his branching arms annoys and with uncomely weeds the gentle wave accloys the antique world in his first flowering youth found no defect in his creators grace but with gladthankes and unreproved truth tne gifts of sovereign bounty did embrace like angels life was then men's happy case but later ages pride like corn-fed steed abused her plenty and fat swollen increase to all licentious lust and gan exceed the measure of her mean and natural first need then gan a cursed hand the quiet womb of his great gandmother with steel to wound and the hid treasures in her sacred tomb with sacrilege to dig therein he found fountains of gold and silver to abound of which the matter of his huge desire and pompous pride eftsoons he did compound then avarice gan through his veins inspire his greedy flames and kindled life-devouring fire son said he then let be thy bitter scorn and leave the rudeness of antique age to them that lived therein in state forlorn thou that dost live in later times must wage thy works for wealth and life for gold engage if then thee list my offered grace to use take what thou please of all this surplusage if thee list not leave have thou to refuse but thing refused do not afterwards accuse me list not said the elfin knight receive thing offered till i know it well be god ne wot i but thou didst these goods bereave from rightful owner by unrighteous lot or that blood guiltiness or guile them blot perdy quoth he yet never eye did view ne tongue did tell ne hand these handled not but safe i have them kept in secret mew from heavens sighed and pour of all which them pursue what secret place quoth he can safely hold so huge a mass and hide from heavens eye or where hast thou thy won that so much gold thou canst preserve from wrong and robbery come thou quoth he and see so by and by through that thick covert he him led and found a darksome way which no man could descry that deep descended through the hollow ground and was with dread and horror compassed around at length they came into a larger space that stretched it self into and ample plain through which a beaten broad high way did trace that straight did led to plutoes griefly rain by that ways side there fate infernal pain and fast beside him sat tumultuous strife the one in hand and iron whip did strain the other brandished a bloody knife and both did gnash their teeth & both did threaten life on tother side in one consort there sat cruel revenge and rancorous despite disloyal treason and heartburning hate but gnawing jealousy out of their sighed sitting alone his bitter lips did bite and trembling fear still to and from did fly and found no place where safe he shroud him might lamenting sorrow did in darkness lie and shame his ugly face did hide from living eye and over them sad horror with grim hew did always soar beating his iron wings and after him owls and night-ravens flew the hateful messengers of heavy things of death and dolour telling sad tidings while sad celeno sitting on a clift a song of bale and bitter sorrow sings that heart of flint a sunder could have rift which having ended after him she flies swift all these before the gates of pluto lay by whom they passing spoke unto them nought but th'elfin knight with wonder all the way did feed his eyes and filled his inner thought at last him to a little door he brought that to the gate of hell which gaped wide was next adjoining ne them parted ought betwixt them both was but a little stride that did the house of richesse from hell-mouth divide before the door sat self-consuming care day and night keeping wary watch and ward for fear least force or fraud should unawares break in and spoil the treasure there in guard ne would he suffer sleep once thitherward approach albe his drowsy den were next for next to death is sleep to be compared therefore his house is unto his annexed here sleep there richesse & hellgate them both betwixt so soon as mammon there arrived the door to him did open and afforded way him followed eke sir guyon evermore ne darkness him ne danger might dismay soon as he entered was the door straight way did shut and from behind it forth there leapt and ugly fiend more fowl then dismal day the which with monstrous stalk behind him stepped and ever as he went due watch upon him kept well hoped he ere long that hardy guest if ever covetous hand or lustful eye or lips he laid on thing that liked him best or ever sleep his eyestrings did untie should be his prey and therefore still on high he over him did hold his cruel claws threatening with greedy gripe to do him die and rend in pieces with his ravenous paws if ever he transgressed the fatal stygian laws that houses form within was rude and strong like and huge cave hewed out of rocky clift from whose rough vault the ragged breaches hung embossed with massy gold of glorious gift and with rich metal loaded every rift that heavy ruin they did seem to threat and over them arachne high did lift her cunning web and spread her subtle net enwrapped in fowl smoke and clouds more black then jet both roof and floor and walls were all of gold but overgrown with dust and old decay and hid in darkness that none could behold the hew thereof for view of cheerful day did never in that house it self display but a faint shadow of uncertain light such as a lamp whose life does fade away or as the moon clothed with cloudy night does show to him that walks in fear and sad affright in all that room was nothing to be seen but huge great iron chests and coffers strong all barred with double bends that none could ween them to efforce by violence or wrong on every side they placed were along but all the ground with skulls was scattered and dead men's bones which round about were flung whose lives it seemed whilom there were shed and their vile carcases now left unburied they forward pass ne guyon yet spoke word till that they came unto and iron door which to them opened of his own accord and showed of richesse such exceeding store as eye of man did never see before ne ever could within one place be found though all the wealth which is or was of yore could gathered be through all the world around and that above were added to that under ground the charge thereof unto a covetous spright commanded was who thereby did attend and warily awaited day and night from other covetous fiends it to defend who it to rob and ransack did intend then mammon turning to that warrior said lo here the world's bliss lo here the end to which all men do aim rich to be made such grace now to be happy is before thee laid certes said he i nill thine offered grace ne to be made so happy do intend another bliss before mine eyes i place another happiness another end to them that list these base regards i lend but i in arms and in achievements brave do rather choose my flitting hours to spend and to be lord of those that riches have then them to have my self and be their servile slave thereat the fiend his gnashing teeth did grate and grieved so long to lack his greedy prey for well he weened that so glorious bait would tempt his guest to take thereof assay had he so done he had him snatched away more light then culver in the falcons fist eternal god thee save from such decay but whenas mammon saw his purpose missed him to entrap unwares another way he wist thence forward he him led and shortly brought unto another room whose door forthright to him did open as it had been taught therein and hundred ranges weren pight and hundred furnaces all burning bright by every furnace many fiends did bide deformed creatures horrible in sighed and every fiend his busy pains applied to melt the golden metal ready to be tried one with great bellows gathered filling air and with forced wind the fuel did inflame another did the dying brands repair with iron tongues and sprinkled oft the same with liquid waves fierce vulcans rage to tame who mastering them renewed his former heat some scummed the dross that from the metal came some stirred the melted our with ladles great and every one did swink and every one did sweat but when as earthly wight they present saw glistering in arms and battailous array from their hot work they did themselves withdraw to wonder at the sighed for till that day they never creature saw that came that way their staring eyes sparkling with fervent fire and ugly shapes did nigh the man dismay that were it not for shame he would retire till that him thus bespoke their sovereign lord & sire behold thou fairies son with mortal eye that living eye before did never see the thing that thou didst crave so earnestly to weet whence all the wealth late showed by me proceeded lo now is revealed to thee here is the fountain of the world's good now therefore if thou wilt enriched be avise thee well and change thy wilful mood lest thou perhaps hereafter wish and be withstood suffice it then thou money god quoth he that all thine idle offers i refuse all that i need i have what needs me to covet more then i have cause to use with such vain shows thy worldlings vile abuse but give me leave to follow mine emprise mammon was much displeased yet no'te he choose but bear the rigour of his bold mespise and thence him forward led him further to entice he brought him through a darksome narrow strait to a broad gate all built of beaten gold the gate was open but therein did wait a sturdy villain striding stiff and bold as the highest god defy he would in his right hand and iron club he held but he himself was all of golden mould yet had both life and sense and well could wielded that cursed weapon when his cruel foes he quelled disdain he called was and did disdain to be so called and who so did him call stern was to look and full of stomach vain his portance terrible and stature tall far passing hight of men terrestrial like and huge giant of the titans raze that made him scorn all creatures great and small and with his pride all others pour deface more fit among black fiends then men to have his place soon as those glitterand arms he did espy that with their brightness made that darkness light his harmful club he gan to hurtle high and threaten battle to the fairy knight who likewise gan himself to battle dight till mammon did his hasty hand withhold and counseled him abstain from perilous fight for nothing might abash the villain bold ne mortal steel empierce his miscreated mould so having him with reason pacified and the fierce carl commanding to forbear he brought him in the room was large and wide as it some guild or solemn temple wear many great golden pillars did upbear the massy roof and riches huge sustain and every pillar decked was full deer with crowns and diadems & titles vain which mortal princes wore while they on earth did rain a rout of people there assembled were of every sort and nation under sky which with great uproar pressed to draw never to upper part where was advanced high a stately siege of sovereign majesty and thereon sat a woman gorgeous gay and richly clad in robes of royalty that never earthly prince in such a ray his glory did enhance and pompous pride display her face right wondrous fair did seem to be that her broad beauty's beam great brightness threw through the dim shade that all men might it see yet was not that same her own native hew but wrought by art and counterfeited show thereby more lovers unto her to call natheless most heavenly fair in deed and view she by creation was till she did fallen thenceforth she sought for helps to cloak her crime withal there as in glistering glory she did fit she held a great gold chain linked well whose upper end to highest heaven was knit and lower part did reach to lowest hell and all that press did round about her swell to catchen hold of that long chain thereby to climb aloft and others to excel that was ambition rash desire to sty and every link thereof a step of dignity some thought to raise themselves to high degree by riches and unrighteous reward some by close shouldrihg some by flattery others through friends others for base regard and all by wrong ways for themselves prepared those that were up themselves kept others low those that were low themselves held others hard ne suffered them to rise or greater grow but every one did strive his fellow down to throw which when as guyon saw he gan inquire what meant that press about that ladies throne and what she was that did so high aspire him mammon answered that goodly one whom all that folk with such contention do flock about my deer my daughter is honour and dignity from her alone derived are and all this world's bliss for which you men do strive few get but many miss and fair philotime she rightly hight the fairest wight that wones under sky but that this darksome nether world her light does dim with horror and deformity worthy of heaven and high felicity from whence the gods have her for envy thrust but sith thou hast found favour in mine eye thy spouse i will her make if that thou lust that she may thee advance for works and merits just gramercy mammon said the gentle knight for so great grace and offered high estate but i that am frail flesh and earthly wight unworthy match for such immortal mate my self well wot and mine unequal fate and were i not yet is my troth plighted and love avowed to other lady late that to remove the same i have no might to change love causeless is reproach to warlike knight mammon immoved was with inward wrath yet forcing it to feign him forth thence led through grisly shadows by a beaten path into a garden goodly garnished with herbs and fruits whose kinds mote not be read not such as earth out of her fruitful womb throws forth to men sweet and well savoured but direful deadly black both leaf and bloom fit to adorn the dead and deck the dreary tomb there mournful cypress grew in greatest store and trees of bitter gall and ebony sad dead sleeping poppy and black hellebore cold coloquintida and tetra mad mortal samnitis and cicuta bade which with th'vniust athenians made to die wise socrates who thereof quaffing glad poured out his life and last philosophy to the fair critias his dearest belamy the gordin of proserpina this hight and in the midst thereof a silver seat with a thick arbour goodly over dight in which she often used from open heat her self to shroud and pleasures to entreat next thereunto did grow a goodly tree with branches broad dispread and body great clothed with leaves that none the wood mote see and loaded all with fruit as thick as it might be their fruit were golden apples glistering bright that goodly was their glory to behold on earth like never grew ne living wight like ever saw but they from hence were sold for those which hercules with conquest bold got from great atlas daughters hence began and planted there did bring forth fruit of gold and those with which th'eubaean young man won swift atalanta when through craft he her out ran here also sprung that goodly golden fruit with which acontius god his lover true whom he had long time sought with fruitless suit here eke that famous golden apple grew the which amongst the gods false ate threw for which the idaean ladies disagreed till partial paris deemed it venus due and had of her fair helen for his meed that many noble greeks and trojans made to bleed the warlike elf much wondered at this tree so fair and great that shadowed all the ground and his broad branches laden with rich fee did stretch themselves without the utmost bound of this great garden compassed with a mound which overhanging they themselves did steep in a black flood which flowed about it round that is the river of cocytus deep in which full many souls do endless wail and weep which to behold he climbed up to the bank and looking down saw many damned wights in those sad waves which direful deadly stanke plunged continually of cruel sprights that with their piteous cries and yelling shright's they made the further shore resounden wide amongst the rest of those same rueful sights one cursed creature he by chance espied that drenched lay full deep under the garden side deep was he drenched to the upmost chin yet gaped still as coveting to drink of the cold liquour which he waded in and stretching forth his hand did often think to reach the fruit which grew upon the brink but both the fruit from hand and flood from mouth did fly aback and made him vainly swink the while he starved with hunger and with drouth he daily died yet never thoroughly dyen couth the knight him seeing labour so in vain asked who he was and what he meant thereby who groaning deep thus answered him again most cursed of all creatures under sky lo tantalus i here tormented lie of whom high ioue wont whilom feasted be lo here i now for want of food do die but if that thou be such as i thee see of grace i pray thee give to eat and drink to me nay nay thou greedy tantalus quoth he abide the fortune of thy present fate and unto all that live in high degree ensample be of mind intemperate to teach them how to use their present state then gan the cursed wretch aloud to cry accusing highest ioue and gods ingrate and eke blaspheming heaven bitterly as author of unjustice there to let him die he looked a little further and espied another wretch whose carcase deep was drowned within the river which the same did hide but both his hands most filthy feculent above the water were on high extent and feigned to wash themselves incessantly yet nothing cleaner were for such intent but rather fouler seemed to the eye so lost his labour vain and idle industry the knight him calling asked who he was who lifting up his head him answered thus i pilate am the falsest judge alas and most unjust that by unrighteous and wicked doom to iewes despiteous delivered up the lord of life to die and did acquit a murderer felonous the while my hands i washed in purity the while my soul was soiled with foul iniquity infinite more tormented in like pain he there beheld too long here to be told ne mammon would there let him long remain for terror of the tortures manifold in which the damned souls he did behold but roughly him bespoke thou fearful fool why takest not of that same fruit of gold ne sittest down on that same silver stool to rest thy weary person in the shadow cool all which he did to do him deadly fallen in frail intemperance through sinful bait to which if he inclined had at all that dreadful fiend which did behind him wait would him have rend in thousand pieces strait but he was wary wise in all his way and well perceived his deceitful sleight ne suffered lust his safety to betray so goodly did beguile the guyler of the prey and now he has so long remained there that vital powers gan wax both weak and wan for want of food and sleep which two upbear like mighty pillars this frail life of man that none without the same enduren can for now three days of men were full outwrought since he this hardy enterprise began for thy great mammon fairly he besought into the world to guide him back as he him brought the god though loath yet was constrained obey for longer time then that no living wight below the earth might suffered be to stay so back again him brought to living light but all so soon as his enfeebled spright gan suck this vital air into his breast as overcome with too exceeding might the life did flit away out of her nest and all his senses were with deadly fit oppressed cant. viii sir guyon laid in swown is by acrates sons despoiled whom arthur soon hath rescued and paynim brothers foiled and is there care in heaven and is there love in heavenly spirits to these creatures base that may compassion of their evils move there is else much more wretched were the case of men then beasts but o th'exceeding grace of highest god that loves his creatures so and all his works with mercy does embrace that blessed angels he sends to and from to serve to wicked man to serve his wicked foe how oft do they their silver bowers leave to come to succour us that succour want how oft do they with golden pinions cleave the flitting skies like flying pursuivant against foul fiends to aid us militant they for us fight they watch and duly ward and their bright squadrons round about us plant and all for love and nothing for reward oh why should heavenly god to men have such regard during the while that guyon did abide in mamons house the palmer whom whilere that wanton maid of passage had denied by further search had passage found elsewhere and being on his way approached near where guyon lay in trance when suddenly he herd a voice that called loud and clear come hither come hither o come hastily that all the fields resounded with the rueful cry the palmer lent his ear unto the noise to weet who called so importunely again he herd a more efforced voice that bade him come in haste he by and by his feeble feet directed to the cry which to that shady delve him brought at last where mammon erst did sun his treasury there the good guyon he found slumbering fast in senseless dream which sighed at first him soar aghast beside his head there sat a fair young man of wondrous beauty and of freshest years whose tender bud to blossom new began and flourish fair above his equal pears his snowy front curled with golden hears like phoebus face adorned with sunny rays divinely shone and two sharp winged shears decked with diverse plumes like painted jays were fixed at his back to cut his airy ways like as cupido on idaean hill when having laid his cruel bow away and mortal arrows wherewith he does fill the world with murderous spoils and bloody prey with his fair mother he him dights to play and with his goodly sisters graces three the goddess pleased with his wanton play suffers her self through sleep beguiled to be the while the other ladies mind their merry glee whom when the palmer saw abashed he was through fear and wonder that he nought could say till him the child bespoke long lacked alas hath be thy faithful aid in hard assay while deadly fit thy pupil does dismay behold this heavy sighed thou reverend sire but dread of death and dolour do away for life ere long shall to her home retire and he that breathless seems shall courage bold respire the charge which god does unto me arrest of his deer safety i to thee commend yet will i not forgo ne yet forget the care thereof my self unto the end but evermore him succour and defend against his foe and mine watch thou i pray for evil is at hand him to offend so having said eftsoons he gan display his painted nimble wings and vanished quite away the palmer seeing his left empty place and his slow eyes beguiled of their sighed wox before afraid and standing still a space gazed after him as fowl escaped by flight at last him turning to his charge behight with trembling hand his troubled pulse gan try where finding life not yet dislodged quite he much rejoiced and covered it tenderly as chicken newly hatched from dreaded destiny at last he spied where towards him did pace two paynim knights all armed as bright as sky and them beside and aged sire did trace and far before a lightfoot page did fly that breathed strife and troublous enmity those were the two sons of acrates old who meeting erst with archimago sly foreby that idle strand of him were told that he which erst them combated was guyon bold which to avenge on him they dearly vowed where ever that on ground they mote him find false archimage provoked their courage proud and strifeful atin in their stubborn mind coals of contention and hot vengeance tined now be they come whereas the palmer sat keeping that slumbered corpse to him assigned well knew they both his person sith of late with him in bloody arms they rashly did debate whom when pyrrhochles saw inflamed with rage that sire he soul bespoke thou dotard vile that with thy bruteness shendest thy comely age abandon soon i read the caitiff spoil of that same outcast carcase that erewhile made it self famous through false treachery and crowned his coward crest with knightly style lo where he now inglorious does lie to prove he lived ill that did thus foully die to whom the palmer fearless answered certes sir knight you be too much to blame thus for to blot the honour of the dead and with foul cowardice his carcase shame whose living hands immortalized his name vile is the vengeance on the ashes cold and envy base to bark at sleeping fame was never wight that treason of him told your self his prowess proved & found him fierce & bold then said cymochles palmer thou dost dote ne canst of prowess ne of knighthood deem save as thou seest or hearst but well i wot that of his puissance trial made extreme yet gold all is not that does golden seem ne all good knights that shake well spear and shield the worth of all men by their end esteem and then due praise or due reproach them yield bad therefore i him deem that thus lies dead on field good or bad gan his brother fierce reply what do i reck sith that he died entire or what does his bad death now satisfy the greedy hunger of revenging ire sith wrathful hand wrought not her own desire yet since no way is left to wreak my spite i will him reave of arms the victor's hire and of that shield more worthy of good knight for why should a dead dog be decked in armour bright fair sir said then the palmer suppliant for knighthood's love do not so foul a deed ne blame your honour with so shameful vaunt of vile revenge to spoil the dead of weed is sacrilege and does all sins exceed but leave these relics of his living might to deck his hearse and trap his tomb-black steed what hearse or steed said he should he have dight but be entombed in the raven or the kite with that rude hand upon his shield he laid and th'other brother gan his helm unlace both fiercely bent to have him disarrayed till that they spied where towards them did pace and armed knight of bold and bounteous grace whose squire boar after him and ebony lance and covered shield well kenned him so far space th'enchaunter by his arms and amenance when under him he saw his lybian steed to prance and to those brothers said rise rise by live and unto battle do your selves address for yonder comes the prowest knight alive prince arthur flower of grace and noblesse that hath to paynim knights wrought great distress and thousand sar'zins foully done to die that word so deep did in their hearts impress that both eftsoons upstarted furiously and gan themselves prepare to battle greedily but fierce pyrrhochles lacking his own sword the want thereof now greatly gan to plain and archimage besought him that afford which he had brought for braggadocchio vain so would i said th'enchaunter glad and feign beteem to you this sword you to defend or ought that else your honour might maintain but that this weapons pour i well have kenned to be contrary to the work which you intend for that same knights own sword this is of yore which merlin made by his almighty art for that his nursling when he knighthood swore therewith to done his foes eternal smart the metal first he mixed with medaewart that no enchantment from his dint might save then it in flames of aetna wrought apart and seuen times dipped in the bitter wave of hellish styx which hidden virtue to it gave the virtue is that neither steel nor stone the stroke thereof from entrance may defend ne ever may be used by his foes ne forced his rightful owner to offend ne ever will it break ne ever bend wherefore morddure it rightfully is hight in vain therefore pyrrhochles should i lend the same to thee against his lord to fight for sure it would deceive thy labour and thy might foolish old man said then the pagan wrath that weenest words or charms may force withstand soon shalt thou see and then believe for troth that i can carve with this enchanted brand his lords own flesh therewith out of his hound that virtuous steel he rudely snatched away and guyons shield about his wrest he bound so ready dight fierce battle to assay and match his brother proud in battailous array by this that stranger knight in presence came and goodly salved them who nought again him answered as courtesy became but with stern looks and stomachous disdain gave signs of grudge and discontentment vain then turning to the palmer he gan spy where at his feet with sorrowful demean and deadly hew and armed corpse did lie in whose dead face he read great magnanimity said he then to the palmer reverend sire what great misfortune hath betid this knight or did his life her fatal date expire or did he fallen by treason or by fight how ever sure i rew his piteous plighted not one nor other said the palmer graven hath him befallen but clouds of deadly night a while his heavy eyelids covered have and all his senses drowned in deep senseless wave which those same foes that stand hereby making advantage to revenge their spite would him disarm and treaten shamefully unworthy usage of redoubted knight but you fair sir whose honourable sighed does promise hope of help and timely grace mote i beseech to succour his sad plighted and by your pour protect his feeble case first praise of knighthood is foul outrage to deface palmer said he no knight so rude i ween as to done outrage to a sleeping ghost ne was there ever noble courage seen that in advantage would his puissance boast honour is least where odds appears most may be that better reason will assuage the rash revengers heat words well disposed have secret pour t'appease inflamed rage if not leave unto me thy knights last patonage tho turning to those brothers thus bespoke you warlike pair whose valorous great might it seems just wrongs to vengeance do provoke to wreak your wrath on this dead seeming knight mote ought allay the storm of your despite and settle patience in so furious heat not to debate the challenge of your right but for this carcase pardon i entreat whom fortune hath already laid in lowest seat to whom cymochles said for what art thou that makest thy self his dayman to prolong the vengeance pressed or who shall let me now on this vile body from to wreak my wrong and make his carcase as the outcast dung why should not that dead carrion satisfy the guilt which if he lived had thus long his life for due revenge should deer aby the trespass still does live albe the person die indeed then said the prince the evil done dies not when breath the body first does leave but from the grandsire to the nephews son and all his seed the curse does often cleave till vengeance utterly the guilt bereave so streightly god does judge but gentle knight that does against the dead his hand uprear his honour stains with rancour and despite and great disparagement makes to his former might pyrrhochles gan reply the second time and to him said now felon sure i read how that thou art partaker of his crime therefore by termagant thou shalt be dead with that his hand more sad then lump of led uplifting high he weened with morddure his own good sword morddure to cleave his head the faithful steel such treason nould endure but swerving from the mark his lords life did assure yet was the force so furious and so fell that horse and man it made to reel aside natheless the prince would not forsake his fell for well of yore he learned had to ride but full of anger fiercely to him cried false traitor miscreant thou broken hast the law of arms to strike foe undefied but thou thy treasons fruit i hope shalt taste right sour & feel the law the which thou hast defaced with that his baleful spear he fiercely bent against the pagans breast and therewith thought his cursed life out of her lodge have rend but ere the point arrived where it ought that seuenfolded shield which he from guyon brought he cast between to ward the bitter stound through all those folds the steelhead passage wrought and through his shoulder pierced wherewith to ground he groveling fell all gored in his gushing wound which when his brother saw fraught with great grief and wrath he to him leapt furiously and foully said by mahoune cursed thief that direful stroke thou dearly shalt aby then hurling up his harmful blade on high smote him so hugely on his haughty crest that from his saddle forced him to fly else mote it needs down to his manly breast have cleft his head in twaine and life thence dispossessed now was the prince in dangerous distress wanting his sword when he on foot should fight his single spear could do him small redress against two foes of so exceeding might the least of which was match for any knight and now the other whom he erst did daunt had reared himself again to cruel fight three times more furious and more puissant unmindful of his wound of his fate ignorant so both atonce him charge on either side with hideous strokes and importable pour that forced him his ground to traverse wide and wisely watch to ward that deadly stour for in his shield as thick as stormy shower their strokes did rain yet did he never quail ne backward shrink but as a steadfast tower whom foe with double battery does assail them on her bulwark bears and bids them nought avail so stoutly he withstood their strong assay till that at last when he advantage spied his poignant spear he thrust with puissant sway at proud cymochles while his shield was wide that through his thigh the mortal steel did gride he swerving with the force within his flesh did break the lance and let the head abide out of the wound the read blood flowed fresh that underneath his feet soon made a purple plash horribly then he gan to rage and rail cursing his gods and himself damning deep also when his brother saw the read blood rail adown so fast and all his armour steep for very fellness loud he gan to weep and said caitiff curffe on thy cruel hound that twice hath sped yet shall it not thee keep from the third brunt of this my fatal brand lo where the dreadful death behind thy back does stand with that he struck and th'other struck withal that nothing seemed mote bear so monstrous might the one upon his covered shield did fallen and glancing down would not his owner bite but th'other did upon his truncheon smite which hewing quite a sunder further way it made and on his hacqueton did light the which dividing with importune sway it seized in his right side and there the dint did stay wide was the wound and a large lukewarm flood read as the rose thence gushed grievously that when the paynim spied the streaming blood gave him great heart and hope of victory on th'other side in huge perplexity the prince now stood having his weapon broke nought could he hurt but still at ward did lie yet with his truncheon he so rudely stroke cymochles twice that twice him forced his foot revoke whom when the palmer saw in such distress sir guyons sword he lightly to him reached and said fair son great god thy right hand bless to use that sword so wisely as it ought glad was the knight & with fresh courage fraught when as again he armed felt his hound then like a lion which hath long time sought his robbed whelps and at the last them found amongst the shepherd swains then waxes wood & yond so fierce he laid about him and dealt blows on either side that neither mail could hold ne shield defend the thunder of his throws now to pyrrhochles many strokes he told eft to cymochles twice so many fold then back again turning his busy hound them both atonce compelled with courage bold to yield wide way to his heart-thrilling brand and though they both stood stiff yet could not both withstand as salvage bull whom two fierce mastiffs bait when rancour does with rage him once engore forgets with wary ward them to await but with his dreadful horns them drives afore or flings aloft or treads down in the flore breathing out wrath and bellowing disdain that all the forest quakes to hear him roar so raged prince arthur betwixt his foemen twaine that neither could his mighty puissance sustain but ever at pyrrhochles when he smit who guyons shield cast ever him before whereon the fairy queens portrait was writ his hand relented and the stroke forbore and his deer heart the picture gan adore which ost the paynim saved from deadly stour but him henceforth the same can save no more for now arrived is his fatal hour that no'te avoided be by earthly skill or pour for when cymochles saw the fowl reproach which them appeached pricked with guilty shame and inward grief he fiercely gan approach resolved to put away that loathly blame or die with honour and desert of fame and on the hauberk stroke the prince so soar that quite disparted all the linked frame and pierced to the skin but bit no more yet made him twice to reel that never moved afore whereat renfierced with wrath and sharp regret he stroke so hugely with his borrowed blade that it empierced the pagans burganet and cleaving the hard steel did deep invade into his head and cruel passage made quite through his brain he tumbling down on ground breathed out has ghost which to infernal shade fast flying there eternal torment found for all the sins wherewith his lewd life did abound which when his germane saw the stony fear ran to his heart and all his sense dismayed ne thenceforth life ne courage did appear but as a man whom hellish fiends have frayed long trembling still he stood at last thus said traitor what hast thou done how ever may thy cursed hand so cruelly have swayed against that knight horrow and well away after so wicked deed why livest thou longer day with that all desperate as loathing light and with revenge desiring soon to die assembling all his force and utmost might with his own sword he fierce at him did fly and struck and foined and lashed outrageously withouten reason or regard well knew the prince with patience and sufferance sly so hasty heat soon cooled to subdue though when this breathless wox that battle gan renew as when a windy tempest blows high that nothing may withstand his stormy stour the clouds as things afraid before him fly but all so soon as his outrageous pour is laid they fiercely then begin to shower and as in scorn of his spent stormy spite now all atonce their malice forth do pour so did sir guyon bear himself in fight and suffered rash pyrrhochles wast his idle might at last when as the sarazin perceived how that strange sword refused to serve his need but when he stroke most strong the dint deceived he flung it from him and devoid of dread upon him lightly leaping without heed betwixt his two mighty arms engrasped fast thinking to overthrow and down him tread but him in strength and skill the prince surpassed and through his nimble sleight did under him down cast nought booted it the paynim then to strive for as a bittur in the eagles claw that may not hope by flight to escape alive still waits for death with dread and trembling awe so he now subject to the victor's law did not once move nor upward cast his eye forvile disdain and rancour which did gnaw his heart in twaine with sad melancholy as one that loathed life and yet despised to die but full of princely bounty and great mind the conqueror nought cared him to slay but casting wrongs and all revenge behind more glory thought to give life then decay and said paynim this is thy dismal day yet if thou wilt renounce thy miscreance and my true liegeman yield thy self for ay life will i grant thee for thy valiance and all thy wrongs will wipe out of my sovenance fool said the pagan i thy gift defy but use thy fortune as it does befall and say that i not overcome do die but in despite of life for death do call wroth was the prince and sorry yet withal that he so wilfully refused grace yet sith his fate so cruelly did fallen his shining helmet he gan soon unlace and left his headless body bleeding all the place by this sir guyon from his trance awaked life having mastered her senseless foe and looking up when as his shield he lacked and sword saw not he waxed wondrous woe but when the palmer whom he long ago hast lost he by him spied right glad he grew and said dear sir whom wandering to and from i long have lacked i joy thy face to view firm is thy faith whom danger never from me drew but rend what wicked hand hath robbed me of my good sword and shield the palmer glad with so fresh hew uprising him to see him answered fair son be no whit sad for want of weapons they shall soon be had so gan he to discourse the whole debate which that strange knight for him sustained had and those two sarazins confounded late whose carcases on ground were horribly prostrate which when he herd and saw the tokens true his heart with great affection was embayed and to the prince with bowing reverence due as to the patron of his life thus said my lord my liege by whose most gracious aid i live this day and see my foes subdued what may suffice to be for meed repaid of so great graces as you have me showed but to be ever bound to whom the insant thus fair sir what need good turns be counted as a servile bound to bind their doers to receive their meed are not all knights by oath bound to withstand oppressors pour by arms and puissant hound suffice that i have done my due in place so goodly purpose they together found of kindness and of courteous aggrace the while false archimage and atin fled apace cant. ix the house of temperance in which does sober almadwell besieged of many foes whom stranger knights to fight compel o fallen gods works which do this world adorn there is no one more fair and excellent then is men body both for pour and form while it is kept in sober government but none then it more fowl and indecent distempered through misrule and passion base it grows a monster and incontinent does lose his dignity and native grace behold who list both one and other in this place after the paynim brothers conquered were the briton prince recovering his stolen sword and guyon his lost shield they both yfere forth passed on their way in fair accord till him the prince with gentle court did board sir knight mote i of you this curtsy read to weet why on your shield so goodly scored bear you the picture of that ladies head full lively is the semblant though the substance dead fair sir said he if in that picture dead such life you read and virtue in vain show what mote you ween if the true livelihood of that most glorious visage you did view but if the beauty of her mind you knew that is her bounty and imperial pour thousand times fairer then her mortal hew oh how great wonder would your thoughts devour and infinite

liege my sovereign my deer whose glory shines as the morning star and with her light the earth illumines clear far reach her mercies and her praises far as well in state of peace as puissance in war thrice happy man said then the briton knight whom gracious lot and thy great valiance have made thee soldier of that princess bright which with her bounty and glad countenance does bless her servants and them high advance how may strange knight hope ever to aspire by faithful service and meet amenance unto such bliss sufficient were that hire for loss of thousand lives to die at her desire said guyon noble lord what meed so great or grace of earthly prince so sovereign but by your wondrous worth and warlike feat you well may hope and easily attain but were your will her sold to entertain and numbered be amongst knights of maidenhead great guerdon well i wot should you remain and in her favour high be reckoned as arthegall and sophy now been honoured certes then said the prince i god avow that sith i arms and knighthood first did plighted my whole desire hath been and yet is now to serve that queen with all my pour and might now hath the sun with his lamp-burning light walked round about the world and i no less sith of that goddess i have sought the sighed yet no where can her find such happiness heaven does to me envy and fortune favourless fortune the foe of famous chevisance seldom said guyon yields to virtue aid but in her way throws mischief and mischance whereby her course is stopped and passage stayed but you fair sir be not herewith dismayed but constant keep the way in which you stand which were it not that i am else delayed with hard adventure which i have in hand i labour would to guide you through all fairy land gramercy sir said he but mote i wot what strange adventure do you now pursue perhaps my succour or advisement meet mote stead you much your purpose to subdue then gan sir guyon all the story show of false acrasia and her wicked wiles which to avenge the palmer him forth drew from fairy court so talked they the while they wasted had much way and measured many miles and now fair phoebus gan decline in haste his weary wagon to the western vale whenas they spied a goodly castle placed foreby a river in a pleasant dale which choosing for that evening's hospital they thither marched but when they came in sighed and from their sweaty coursers did avail they found the gates fast barred long ere night and every loup fast locked as fearing foes despite which when they saw they weened fowl reproach was to them done their entrance to forestall till that the squire gan nigher to approach and wind his horn under the castle wall that with the noise it shook as it would fallen eftsoons forth looked from the highest spire the watch and loud unto the knights did call to weet what they so rudely did require who gently answered they entrance did desire fly fly good knights said he fly fast away if that your lives you love as meet you should fly fast and save your selves from near decay here may you not have entrance though we would we would and would again if that we could but thousand enemies about us rave and with long siege us in this castle hold seuen years this wise they us besieged have and many good knights slain that have us sought to save thus as he spoke lo with outrageous cry a thousand villains round about them swarmed out of the rocks and caves adjoining nigh vile caitiff wretches ragged rude deformed all threatening death all in strange manner armed some with unwieldy clubs some with long spears some rusty knives some staves in fire warmed sterne was their look like wild amazed steers staring with hollow eyes and stiff upstanding hears fiercely at first those knights they did assail and drove them to recoil but when again they gave fresh charge their forces gan to fail unable their encounter to sustain for with such puissance and impetuous main those champions broke on them that forced them fly like scattered speepe whenas the shepherds swain a lion and a tiger does espy with greedy pace forth rushing from the forest nigh a while they fled but soon returned again with greater fury then before was found and evermore their cruel captain sought with his rascal routs t'enclose them round and overrun to tread them to the ground but soon the knights with their bright-burning blades broke their rude troops and order did confound hewing and slashing at their idle shades for though they bodies seem yet substance from them fades as when a swarm of gnats at eventide out of the fens of allan do arise their murmuring small trumpets sounden wide while in the air their clustering army flies that as a cloud does seem to dim the skies ne man nor beast may rest or take repast for their sharp wounds and noyous injuries till the fierce northern wind blustering blast does blow them quite away and in the ocean cast thus when they had that troublous rout dispersed unto the castle gate they come again and entrance craved which was denied erst now when report of that their perilous pain and cumbrous comflict which they did sustain came to the ladies ear which there did dwell she forth issued with a goodly train of squires and ladies equipaged well and entertained them right fairly as befell alma she called was a virgin bright that had not yet felt cupides wanton rage yet was she wooed of many a gentle knight and many a lord of noble parentage that sought with her to link in marriage for she was fair as fair mote ever be and in the flower now of her freshest age yet full of grace and goodly modesty that even heaven rejoiced her sweet face to see in robe of lily white she was arrayed that from her shoulder to her heel down reached the train whereof lose far behind her strayed branched with gold & pearl most richly wrought and born of two fair damsels which were taught that service well her yellow golden hear was trimly woven and in tresses wrought ne other tyre she on her head did wear but crowned with a garland of sweet rosier goodly she entertained those noble knights and brought them up into her castle hall where gentle court and gracious delight she to them made with mildness virginal showing her self both wise and liberal there when they rested had a season due they her be sought of favour special of that fair castle to afford them view she granted & them leading forth the same did show first she them led up to the castle wall that was so high as foe might not it climb and all so fair and sensible withal not built of brick ne yet of stone and lime but of thing like to that egyptian slime whereof king nine whilom built babell tower but o great pity that no longer time so goodly workmanship should not endure soon it must turn to earth no earthly thing is sure the frame thereof seemed partly circular and part triangular o work divine those two the first and last proportions are the one imperfect mortal feminine th'other immortal perfect masculine and betwixt them both a quadrate was the base proportioned equally by seuen and nine nine was the circle set in heavens place all which compacted made a goodly dyapase therein two gates were placed seemly well the one before by which all in did pass did th'other far in workmanship excel for not of wood nor of enduring brass but of more worthy substance framed it was doubly disparted it did lock and close that when it locked none might thorough pass and when it opened no man might it close still open to their friends and closed to their foes of hewn stone the porch was fairly wrought stone more of value and more smooth and fine then let or marble far from ireland brought over the which was cast a wandering vine enchased with a wanton ivy twine and over it a fair portcullis hung which to the gate directly did incline with comely compass and compacture strong neither unseemly short nor yet exceeding long within the barbican a porter sat day and night duly keeping watch and ward nor wight nor word mote pass out of the gate but in good order and with due regard utterers of secrets he from thence debarred babblers of folly and blazers of crime his alarm-bell might loud and wide be hard when cause required but never out of time early and late it rung at evening and at prime and round about the porch on every side twice sixteen warders sat all armed bright in glistering steel and strongly fortified tall yeomen seemed they and of great might and were enranged ready still for sighed by them as alma passed with her guests they did obeisance as beseemed right and then again returned to their rests the porter eke to her did lout with humble gests thence she them brought into a stately hall wherein were many tables fair dispread and ready dight with drapets festival against the viands should be ministered at upper end there sat clad in read down to the ground a comely personage that in his hand a white rod managed he steward was hight diet ripe of age and in demeanour sober and in counsel sage and through the hall there walked to and from a jolly yeoman marshal of the same whose name was appetite he did bestow both guests and meat when ever in they came and knew them how to order without blame as him the steward bad they both atone did duty to their lady as became who passing by forth led her guests anon into the kitchen room ne spared for niceness none it was a vault built for great dispense with many ranges reared along the wall and one great chimney whose long tonnell thence the smoke forth threw and in the midst of all there placed was a cauldron wide and tall upon a mighty furnace burning hot more hot then aetn or flaming mongiball for day and night it brent ne ceased not so long as any thing it in the cauldron god but to delay the heat lest by mischance it might break out and set the whole on fire there added was by goodly ordinance and huge great pair of bellows which did stir continually and cooling breath inspire about the cauldron many cooks accoiled with hooks and ladles as need did require the while the viands in the vessel boiled they did about their business sweat and sorely toiled the master cooke was called concoction a careful man and full of comely guise the kitchen clerke that hight digestion did order all th'achates in seemly wise and set them forth as well he could devise the rest had several offices assigned some to remove the scum as it did rise others to bear the same away did mind and others it to use according to his kind but all the liquour which was fowl and waste not good nor serviceable else for ought they in another great round vessel placed till by a conduit pipe it thence were brought and all the rest that noyous was and nought by secret ways that none might it espy was close conveyed and to the back-gate brought that cleped was port esquiline whereby it was avoided quite and thrown out privily which goodly order and great workman's skill when as those knights beheld with rare delight and gazing wonder they their minds did fill for never had they seen so strange a sighed thence back again fair alma led them right and soon into a goodly parlour brought that was with royal arras richly dight in which was nothing portrayed nor wrought not wrought nor portrayed but easy to be thought and in the midst thereof upon the flower a lovely bevy of fair ladies sat courted of many a jolly paramour the which them did in modest wise amate and each one sought his lady to aggrate and eke amongst them little cupid played his wanton sports being returned late from his fierce wars and having from him laid his cruel bow wherewith he thousands hath dismayed diverse delights they found them selves to please some song in sweet consort some laughed for joy some played with straws some idly sat at ease but other some could not abide to toy all pleasance was to them grief and annoy this frowned that fawned the third for shame did blush another seemed envious or coy another in her teeth did gnaw a rush but at these strangers presence every one did hush soon as the gracious alma came in place they all atonce out of their seats arose and to her homage made with humble grace whom when the knights beheld they gan dispose themselves to court and each a damsel chosen the prince by chance did on a lady light that was right fair and fresh as morning rose but somewhat sad and solemn eke in sighed as if some pensive thought constrained her gentle spright in a long purple pall whose skirt with gold was fretted all about she was arrayed and in her hand a poplar branch did hold to whom the prince in courteous manner said gentle madame why been you thus dismayed and your fair beauty do with sadness spill lives any that you hath thus ill paid or done your love or done you lack your will what ever be the cause it sure beseems you ill fair sir said she half in disdainful wise how is it that this word in me you blame and in your self do not the same advise him ill beseems another's fault to name that may unwares be blotted with the same pensive i yield i am and sad in mind through great desire of glory and of fame ne ought i ween are you therein behind that have twelue months sought one yet no where can her find the prince was inly moved at her speech well weeting true what she had rashly told yet with fair semblant sought to hide the breach which change of colour did perforce unfold now seeming flaming hot now stony cold tho turning soft aside he did inquire what wight she was that poplar branch did hold it answered was her name was prays-desire that by well doing sought to honour to aspire the while the faery knight did entertain another damsel of that gentle crew that was right fair and modest of demean but that too oft she changed her native hew strange was her tyre and all her garment blew close round about her tucked with many a plighted upon her fist the bird which shuns view and keeps in coverts close from living wight did fit as yet ashamed how rude pan did her dight so long as guyon with her commoned unto the ground she cast her modest eye and ever and anon with rosy read the bashful blood her snowy cheeks did die that her became as polished ivory which cunning craftsman hand hath overlaid with fair vermilion or pure lastery great wonder had the knight to see the maid so strangely passioned and to her gently said fair damosel seems by your troubled cheer that either me too bold you ween this wise you to molest or other ill to fear that in the secret of your heart close lies from whence it does as cloud from sea arise if it be i of pardon i you pray but if ought else that i mote not devise i will if please you it discover assay to ease you of that ill so wisely as i may she answered nought but more abashed for shame held down her head the while her lovely face the flashing blood with blushing did inflame and the strong passion marred her modest grace that guyon marveled at her uncouth case till alma him bespoke why wonder ye fair sir at that which you so much embrace she is the fountain of your modesty you shamefast are but shamefastness it self is she thereat the elf did blush in privity and turned his face away but she the same dissembled fair and feigned to oversee thus they awhile with court and goodly game themselves did solace each one with his dame till that great lady thence away them sought to view her castles other wondrous frame up to a stately turret she them brought ascending by ten steps of alabaster wrought that turrets frame most admirable was like highest heaven compassed around and lifted high above this earthly mass which it surveyed as hills done lower ground but not on ground mote like to this be found not that which antique cadmus whilom built in thebes which alexander did confound nor that proud tower of troy though richly guilt from which young hectors blood by cruel greeks was spilled the roof hereof was arched over head and decked with flowers and herbars daintily two goodly beacons set in watches stead therein gave light and flamed continually for they of living fire most subtly were made and set in silver sockets bright covered with lids devise of substance sly that readily they shut and open might o who can tell the praises of that makers might ne can i tell ne can i stay to tell this parts great workmanship & wondrous pour that all this other world's work does excel and likest is unto that heavenly tower that god hath built for his own blessed bower therein were diverse rooms and diverse stages but three the chiefest and of greatest pour in which there dwelled three honourable sages the wisest men i ween that lived in their ages not he whom greece the nurse of all good arts by phoebus doom the wisest thought alive might be compared to these by many parts nor that sage pylian sire which did survive three ages such as mortal men contrive by whose advise old priams city fell with these in praise of policies mote strive these three in these three rooms did sundry dwell and counseled fair alma how to govern well the first of them could things to come foresee the next could of things present best advise the third things past could keep in memory so that no time nor reason could arise but that the same could one of these comprise for thy the first did in the forepart fit that nought mote hinder his quick prejudice he had a sharp foresight and working wit that never idle was ne once could rest a whit his chamber was depainted all within with sundry colours in the which were writ infinite shapes of things dispersed thin some such as in the world were never yet ne can devised be of mortal wit some daily seen and known by their names such as in idle fantasies do flit infernal hags centaurs fiends hippodames apes lions aegles owls fools lovers children dams and all the chamber filled was with flies which buzzed all about and made such found that they encumbered all men's ears and eyes like many swarms of bees assembled round after their hives with honey do abound all those were idle thoughts and fantasies devices dreams opinions unsound shows visions soothsays and prophecies and all that feigned is as leasings tales and lies amongst them all sat he which woned there that hight phantastes by his nature true a man of years yet fresh as mote appear of swarth complexion and of crabbed hew that him full of melancholy did show bent hollow beetle brows sharp staring eyes that mad or foolish seemed one by his view more deem him born with ill disposed skies when oblique saturne sat in the house of agonies whom alma having showed to her guests thence brought them to the second room whose walls were painted fair with memorable gests of famous wizards and with picturals of magistrates of courts of tribunals of come wealths of states of policy of laws of judgements and of decretals all arts all science all philosophy and all that in the world was aye thought wittily of those that room was full and them among there sat a man of ripe and perfect age who did them meditate all his life long that through continual practice and usage he now was grown right wise and wondrous sage great pleasure had those stranger knights to see his goodly reason and graven personage that his disciples both desired to be but alma thence them led to hindmost room of three that chamber seemed ruinous and old and therefore was removed far behind yet were the walls that did the same uphold right firm & strong though somewhat they declined and therein sat and old oldman half blind and all decrepit in his feeble corpse yet lively vigour rested in his mind and recompensed him with a better scorse weak body well is changed for minds redoubled force this man of infinite remembrance was and things foregone through many ages held which he recorded still as they did pass ne suffered them to perish through long eld as all things else the which this world does wielded but laid them up in his immortal shrine where they for ever incorrupted dwelled the wars he well remembered of king nine of old assaracus and inachus divine the years of nestor nothing were to his ne yet mathusalem though longest lived for he remembered both their infancies ne wonder then if that he were deprived of native strength now that he them survived his chamber all was hanged about with rolls and old records from ancient times derived some made in books some in long parchment scrolls that were all wormeaten and full of canker holes amid them all he in a chair was set tossing and turning them withouten end but for he was unable them to set a little boy did on him still attend to reach when ever he for ought did send and oft when things were lost or laid amiss that boy them sought and unto him did lend therefore he anamnestes cleped is and that old man eumnestes by their properties the knights there entering did him reverence due and wondered at his endless exercise then as they gan his library to view and antique registers for to avise there chanced to the princes hand to rise and ancient book hight briton monuments that of this lands first conquest did devise and old division into regiments till it reduced was to one men governments sir guyon chanced eke on another book that hight antiquity of faery land in which when as he greedily did look th'off-spring of elves and fairies there he found as it delivered was from hound to hound whereat they burning both with fervent fire their countries ancestry to understand craved leave of alma and that aged sire to read those books who gladly granted their desire cant. x. a chronicle of briton kings from brute to vthers rain and rolls of elfin emperors till time of gloriane who now shall give unto me words and found equal unto this haughty enterprise or who shall lend me wings with which from ground my lowly verse may loftily arise and lift it self unto the highest skies more ample spirit then hitherto was wont here needs me while the famous ancestries of my most dreaded sovereign i recount by which all earthly princes she does far surmount ne under sun that shines so wide and fair whence all that lives does borrow life and light lives ought that to her lineage may compare which though from earth it be derived right yet does it self stretch forth to heavens hight and all the world with wonder overspread a labour huge exceeding far my might how shall frail pen with fear disparaged conceive such sovereign glory and great bountihood argument worthy of moenian quill or rather worthy of great phoebus rote whereon the ruins of great ossa hill and triumphs of phelegraean ioue he wrote that all the gods admired his lofty note but if some relish of that heavenly lay his learned daughters would to me report to deck my song withal i would assay thy name o sovereign queen to blazon far away thy name o sovereign queen thy realm and raze from this renowned prince derived are whom mightily upheld that royal mace which now thou bearest to thee descended far from mighty kings and conquerors in war thy father's and great grandfathers of old whose noble deeds above the northern star immortal fame for ever hath enrolled as in that old men book they were in order told the land which warlike britons now possess and therein have their mighty empire raised in antique times was salvage wilderness unpeopled unmanured unproved unpraised ne was it island then ne was it poised amid the ocean waves ne was it sought of merchants far for profits therein praised but was all desolate and of some thought by sea to have be from the celtioke mainland brought ne did it then deserve a name to have till that the venturous mariner that way learning his ship from those white rocks to save which all along the southern seacoast lay threatening unheedy wreck and rash decay for safeties sake that same his seamark made and named it albion but later day finding in it fit ports for fishers trade gan more the same frequent and further to invade but far in land a salvage nation dwelled of hideous giants and half beastly men that never tasted grace nor goodness felt but like wild beasts lurking in loathsome den and flying fast as roebuck through the fen all naked without shame or care of cold by hunting and by spoiling lived then of stature huge and eke of courage bold that sons of men amazed their sternness to behold but whence they sprung or how they were begotten uneath is to assure uneath to ween that monstrous error which does some assot that dioclesians fiftie daughters sheen into this land by chance have driven be where companing with fiends and filthy sprights through vain illusion of their lust unclean they brought forth giants and such dreadful wights as far exceeded men in their immeasured mights they held this land and with their filthiness polluted this same gentle soil long time that their own mother loathed their beastliness and gan abhor her brood's unkindly crime all were they born of her own native slime until that brutus anciently derived from royal stock of old assaraos line driven by fatal error here arrived and them of their unjust possession deprived but ere he had established his throne and spread his empire to the utmost shore he fought great battles with his salvage foes in which he them defeated evermore and many giants left on groaning flore that well can witness yet unto this day the western hogh besprinkled with the gore of mighty goemot whom in stout fray corineus conquered and cruelly did slay and eke that ample pit yet far renowned for the large leap which debon did compel coulin to make being eight lug's of ground into the which returning back he fell but those three monstrous stones do most excel which that huge son of hideous albion whose father hercules in fraunce did quell great godmer threw in fierce contention at bold canutus but of him was slain anon in meed of these great conquests by them god corineus had that province utmost west to him assigned for his worthy lot which of his name and memorable gest he called cornewaile yet so called best and debons share was that is deuonshyre but canute had his portion from the rest the which he called canutium for his hire now cantium which kenned we commonly inquire thus brute this realm unto his rule subdued and reigned long in great felicity loved of his friends and of his foes eschewed he left three sons his famous progeny born of fair inogene of italy amongst whom he parted his imperial state and locrine left chief lord of britany at last ripe age bade him surrender late his life and long good fortune unto final fate locrine was left the sovereign lord of all but albanact had all the northern part which of himself albania he did call and camber did possess the western quart which seuerne now from logris does depart and each his portion peaceably enjoyed ne was there outward breach nor grudge in heart that once their quiet government annoyed but each his pains to others profit still employed until a nation strange with visage swart and courage fierce that all men did affray which through the world them swarmed in every part and overflowed all countries far away like noyes great flood with their importune sway this land invaded with like violence and did themselves through all the north display until that locrine for his realms defence did head against them make and strong munificence he them encountered a confused rout foreby the river that whilom was hight the ancient abus where with courage stout he them defeated in victorious fight and chaste so fiercely

fell next him king leyr in happy peace long reigned but had no issue male him to succeed but three fair daughters which were well uptrained in all that seemed fit for kingly seed amongst whom his realm he equally decreed to have divided tho when feeble age nigh to his utmost date he saw proceed he called his daughters and with speeches sage inquired which of them most did love her parentage the eldest gonorill gan to protest that she much more then her own life him loved and regan greater love to him professed then all the world when ever it were proved but cordeill said she loved him as behooved whose simple answer wanting colours fair to paint it forth him to displeasance moved that in his crown he counted her no hair but betwixt the other twaine his kingdom whole did share so wedded th'one to maglan king of scots and th'other to the king of cambria and betwixt them shared his realm by equal lots but without dowry the wise cordelia was sent to aganip of celtica their aged sire thus cased of his crown a private life led in albania with gonorill long had in great renown that nought him grieved to be from rule deposed down but true it is that when the oil is spent the light goes out and week is thrown away so when he had resigned his regiment his daughter gan despise his drooping day and weary wax of his continual stay tho to his daughter rigan he repaired who him at first well used every way but when of his departure she despaired her bounty she abated and his cheer impaired the wretched man gan then avise too late that love is not where most it is professed

forlorn thenceforth this realm was into factions rend whilst each of brutus boasted to be born that in the end was left no monument of brutus nor of britons glory ancient then up arose a man of

dominion by strength was wielded without policy therefore he first wore crown of gold for dignity donwallo died for what may live for ay and left two sons of peerless prowess both that sacked room too dearly did assay the recompense of their perjured oath and ransacked greece well tried when they were wroth beside subjected fraunce and germany which yet their praises speak all be they loath and inly tremble at the memory of brennus and bellinus kings of britany next them did gurgunt great bellinus son in rule succeed and eke in father's praise he easterland subdued and danmarke won and of them both did foy and tribute raise the which was due in his dead father's days he also gave to fugitives of spayne whom he at sea found wandering from their ways a seat in ireland safely to remain

their utmost date and then therein reseized was again and ruled long with honourable state till he surrendered realm and life to fate then all the sons of these fiue brothers reigned by due success and all their nephews late even thrice eleuen descents the crown retained till aged hely by due heritage it gained he had two sons whose eldest called lord left of his life most famous memory and endless monuments of his great good the ruined walls he did reaedifye of troynouant gainst force of enemy and built that gate which of his name is hight by which he lies entombed solemnly he left two sons too young to rule aright androgeus and tenantius pictures of his might while they were young cassibalane their eme was by the people chosen in their stead who on him took the royal diadem and goodly well long time it governed till the proud romans him disquieted and warlike caesar tempted with the name of this sweet island never conquered and envying the britons blazed fame oh hideous hunger of dominion hither came yet twice they were repulsed back again and twice reinforced back to their ships to fly the while with blood they all the shore did stain and the grey ocean into purple die ne had they footing found at last perdy had not androgeus false to native soil and envious or uncle's sovereignty betrayed his country unto foreign spoil nought else but treason from the first this land did foil so by him caesar god the victory through great bloushed and many a sad assay in which him self was charged heavily of hardy nennius whom he yet did slay but lost his sword yet to be seen this day thenceforth this land was tributary made t'ambitious room and did their rule obey till arthur all that reckoning did defray yet oft the briton kings against them strongly swayed next him tenantius reigned then kimbeline what time th'eternall lord in fleshly slime enwombed was from wretched adams line to purge away the guilt of sinful crime oh joyous memory of happytime that heavenly grace so plenteously displayed oh too high ditty for my simple rhyme soon after this the romans him wrrayd for that their tribute he refused to let be paid good claudius that next was emperor and army brought and with him battle fought in which the king was by a traitor disguised slain ere any thereof thought yet ceased not the bloody fight for ought for aruirage his brother's place supplied both in arms and crown and by that draught did driven the romans to the weaker side that they to peace agreed so all was pacified was never king more highly magnified nor dreaded of romans then was aruirage for which the emperor to him allied his daughter genuiss ' in marriage yet shortly he renounced the vassalage of room again who hither hastily sent vespasian that with great spoil and rage forwasted all till genuissa gent persuaded him to cease and her lord to relent he died and him succeeded marius who joyed his days in great tranquillity then coyll and after him good lucius that first received christianitie the sacred pledge of christes evangely yet true it is that long before that day hither came ioseph of arimathy who brought with him the holy grail they say and preached the truth but since it greatly did decay this good king shortly without issue died whereof great trouble in the kingdom grew that did her self in sundry parts divide and with her pour her own self overthrew whilst romans daily did the weak subdue which seeing stout bunduca up arose and taking arms the britons to her drew with whom she marched straight against her foes and them unwares beside the seuerne did enclose there she with them a cruel battle tried not with so good success as she deserved by reason that the captains on her side corrupted by paulinus from her swerved yet such as were through former flight perserued gathering again her host she did renew and with fresh courage on the victor served but being all defeated save a few rather then fly or be captived her self she slew o famous monument of women's praise matchable either to semiramis whom antique history so high does raise or to hysiphil ' or to thomiris her host two hundred thousand numbered is who while good fortune favoured her might triumphed oft against her enemies and yet though overcome in hapless fight she triumphed on death in enemies despite her relics fulgent having gathered fought with scuerus and him overthrew yet in the chase was slain of them that fled so made them victor's whom he did subdue then gan carausius tyrannise anew and gainst the romans bent their proper pour but him allectus treacherously slew and took on him the robe of emperor natheless the same enjoyed but short happy hour for asclepiodate him overcame and left inglorious on the vanquished plain without or robe or rag to hide his shame then afterwards he in his stead did rain but shortly was by coyll in battle slain who after long debate since lucies time was of the britons first crowned sovereign then gan this realm renew her passed prime he of his name coylchester built of stone and lime which when the romans herd they hither sent constantius a man of much might with whom king coyll made and agreement and to him gave for wife his daughter bright fair helena the fairest living wight who in all godly thews and goodly praise did far excel but was most famous hight for skill in music of all in her days aswell in curious instruments as cunning lays of whom he did great constantine beget who afterwards was emperor of room to which while absent he his mind did set octauius here leapt into his room and it usurped by unrighteous doom but he his title justified by might slaying traherne and having overcome the roman legion in dreadful fight so settled he his kingdom and confirmed his right but wanting issue male his daughter deer he gave in wedlock to maximian and him with her made of his kingdom heir who soon by means thereof the empire won till murdered by the friends of gratian then gan the hunnes and picts invade this land during the reign of maximinian who dying left none heir them to withstand but that they overran all parts with easy hand the weary britons whose war-able youth was by maximian lately led away with wretched misery's and woeful ruth were to those pagans made and open prey and daily spectacle of sad decay whom roman wars which now foure hundred years and more had wasted could no whit dismay till by consent of commons and of pears they crowned the second constantine with joyous tears who having oft in battle vanquished those spoilful picts and swarming easterlings long time in peace his realm established yet oft annoyed with sundry bordragings of neighbour scots and foreign scatterlings with which the world did in those days abound which to outbar with painful pyonings from sea to sea he heaped a mighty mound which from alcluid to panwelt did that border bound three sons he dying left all under age by means whereof their uncle vortigere usurped the crown during their pupillage which th'infants tutors gathering to fear them closely into armorick did bear for dread of whom and for those picts annoys he sent to germanie strange aid to rear from whence eftsoons arrived here three hoys of saxons whom he for his safety employs two brothers were their captains which hight hengist and horsus well approved in war and both of them men of renowned might who making vantage of their civil jar and of those foreigners which came from far grew great and god large portions of land that in the realm ere long they stronger are then they which sought at first their helping hand and vortiger inforced the kingdom to aband but by the help of vortimere his son he is again unto his rule restored and hengist seeming sad for that was done received is to grace and new accord through his fair daughters face & flattering word soon after which three hundred lords he slew of british blood all sitting at his board whose doleful monuments who list to rew th'eternall marks of treason may at stonheng view by this the sons of constantine which fled ambrise and vther did ripe years attain and here arriving strongly challenged the crown which vortiger did long detain who flying from his guilt by them was slain and hengist eke soon brought to shameful death thenceforth aurelius peaceably did rain till that through poison stopped was his breath so now entombed lies at stoneheng by the heath after him vther which pendragon hight succeeding there abruptly it did end without full point or other censure right as if the rest some wicked hand did rend or the author self could not at least attend to finish it that so untimely breach the prince him self half seems to offend yet secret pleasure did offence impeach and wonder of antiquity long stopped his speech at last quite ravished with delight to hear the royal offspring of his native land cried out dear country o how dearly deer ought thy remembrance and perpetual band be to thy foster child that from thy hand did common breath and nourriture receive how brutish is it not to understand how much to her we owe that all us gave that gave unto us all what ever good we have but guyon all this while his book did read ne yet has ended for it was a great and ample volume that does far exceed my leisure so long leaves here to repeat it told how first prometheus did create a man of many parts from beasts derived and then stole fire from heaven to animate his work for which he was by love deprived of life him self and heartstrings of and aegle rived that man so made he called elf to weet quick the first author of all elfin kind who wandering through the world with weary feet did in the gardens of adonis find a goodly creature whom he deemed in mind to beno earthly wight but either spright

the world warrayed and to them selves all nations did subdue the first and eldest which that sceptre swayed was elfin him all india obeyed and all that now america men call next him was noble elfinan who laid cleopolis foundation first of all but elfiline enclosed it with a golden wall his son was elfinell who overcame the wicked gobelins in bloody field but elfant was of most renowned fame who all of crystal did panthea built then elfar who two brothers giants killed the one of which had two heads th'other three then elfinor who was in magic skilled he built by art upon the glassy see a bridge of brass whose found heavens thunder seemed to be he left three sons the which in order reigned and all their offspring in their due descents even seuen hundred princes which maintained with mighty deeds their sundry governments that were too long their infinite contents here to record ne much material yet should they be most famous monuments and bratie ensample both of martial and civil rule to kings and states imperial after all these elficleos did rain the wise elficleos in great majesty who mightily that sceptre did sustain and with rich spoils and famous victory did high advance the crown of fairy he left two sons of which fair elferon the eldest brother did untimely die whose empty place the mighty oberon doubly supplied in spousal and dominion great was his power and glory over all which him before that sacred seat did fill that yet remains his wide memorial he dying left the fairest tanaquill him to succeed therein by his last will fairer and nobler lives none this

soul into captivity their force is fiercer through infirmity of the frail flesh relenting to their rage and exercise most bitter tyranny upon the parts brought into their bondage no wretchedness is

before the morn with cremosin ray the windows of bright heaven opened had through which into the world the dawning day might look that makes every creature glad uprose sir guyon in bright armour clad and to his purposed journey him prepared with him the palmer eke in habit sad him self addressed to that adventure hard so to the rivers side they both together fared where them awaited ready at the ford the ferryman as alma had behight with his well rigged boat they go aboard and eftsoons gan launch his bark forthright ere long they rowed were quite out of sighed and fast the land behind them fled away but let them pass while wind and weather right do serve their turns here i a while must stay to see a cruel fight done by the prince this day for all so soon as guyon thence was gone upon his voyage with his trusty guide that wicked band of villains fresh begun that castle to assail on every side and lay strong siege about it far and wide so huge and infinite their numbers were that all the land they under them did hide so fowl and ugly that exceeding fear their visages impressed when they approached near them in twelue troops their captain did dispart and round about in sittest steads did place where each might best offend his proper part and his contrary object most deface as every one seemed meetest in that case seuen of the same against the castle gate in strong entrenchments he did closely place which with incessant force and endless hate they battered day and night and entrance did await the other fiue fiue sundry ways he set against the fiue great bulwarks of that pile and unto each a bulwark did arrest assail with open force or hidden guile in hope thereof to win victorious spoil they all that charge did seruently apply with greedy malice and importune toil and planted there their huge artillery with which they daily made most dreadful battery the first troop was a monstrous rabblement of fowl misshapen wights of which some were headed like owls with becks uncomely bent others like dogs others like gryfon drear and some had wings and some had claws to tear and every one of them had lynxes' eyes and every one did bow and arrows bear all those were lawless lusts corrupt envies and covetous aspects all cruel enemies those same against the bulwark of the sighed did lay strong siege and battailous assault ne once did yield it respite day nor night but soon as titan gan his head exalt and soon again as he his light with halt their wicked engines they against it bent that is each thing by which the eyes may fault but two then all more huge and violent beauty and money they that bulwark sorely rend the second bulwark was the hearing sense gainst which the second troop designment makes deformed creatures in strange difference some having heads like hearts some like to snakes some like wild boars late roused out of the brakes slanderous reproaches and fowl infamies leasings backbitings and vainglorious crake's bad counsels praises and false flatteries all those a gainst that fort did bend their batteries likewise that same third fort that is the smell of that third troop was cruelly assayed whose hideous shapes were like to fiends of hell some like to hounds some like to apes dismayed some like to puttocks all in plumes arrayed all shaped according their conditions for by those ugly forms weren portrayed foolish delights and found abusions which do that sense besiege with light illusions and that fourth band which cruel battery bent against the fourth bulwark that is the taste was as the rest a greasy rabblement some mouthed like greedy oystriges some fast like loathly toads some fashioned in the waste like swine for so deformed is luxury surfeit misdiet and unthrifty waste vain feasts and idle superfluity all those this senses fort assail incessantly but the fift troop most horrible of hew and fierce or force was dreadful to report for some like snails some did like spiders show and some like ugly urchins thick and short cruelly they assailed that fift fort armed with darts of sensual delight with stings of carnal lust and strong effort of feeling pleasures with which day and night against that same fift bulwark they continued fight thus these twelue troops with dreadful puissance against that castle restless siege did lay and evermore their hideous ordinance upon the bulwarks cruelly did play that now it gan to threaten near decay and evermore their wicked capitaine provoked them the breaches to assay sometimes with threats sometimes with hope of gain which by the ransack of that piece they should attain on th'other side assieged castles ward their steadfast stands did mightily maintain and many bold repulse and many hard achievement wrought with peril and with pain that goodly frame from ruin to sustain and those two brothers giants did defend the walls so stoutly with their sturdy main that never entrance any durst pretend but they to direful death their groaning ghosts did send the noble virgin lady of the place was much dismayed with that dreadful sighed for never was she in so evil case till that the prince seeing her woeful plighted gan her recomfort from so sad affright offering his service and his dearest life for her defence against that carl to fight which was their chief and author of that strife she him remercy as the patron of her life eftsoones himself in glitterand arms he dight and his well proved weapons to him hent so taking courteous congé he behight those gates to be unbarred and forth he went fair mote he thee the prowest and most gent that ever brandished bright steel on high whom soon as that unruly rabblement with his gay squire issuing did espy they reared a most outrageous dreadful yelling cry and therewith all atonce at him let fly their fluttering arrows thick as flakes of snow and round about him flock impetuously like a great water flood that tumbling low from the high mountains threats to overflow with sudden fury all the fertile plain and the sad husbandman's long hope does throw a down the stream and all his vows make vain nor bounds nor banks his headlong ruin may sustain upon his shield their heaped hail he boar and with his sword dispersed the rascal flocks which fled a sunder and him fell before as withered leaves drop from their dried stocks when the wroth western wind does reave their locks and under neath him his courageous steed the fierce spumador trodden them down like docks the fierce spumador born of heavenly seed such as laomedon of phoebus raze did breed which sudden horror and confused cry when as their captain herd in haste he yode the cause to weet and fault to remedy upon a tiger swift and fierce he road that as the wind ran underneath his load while his long legs nigh reached unto the ground full large he was of limb and shoulders broad but of such subtle substance and unsound that like a ghost he seemed whose graveclothes were unbound and in his hand a bent bow was seen and many arrows under his right side all deadly dangerous all cruel keen headed with flint and feathers bloody died such as the indians in their quivers hide those could he well direct and straight as line and bid them strike the mark which he had eyed ne was their salve ne was their medicine that mote recure their wounds so inly they did tine as pale and wan as ashes was his look his body lean and meager as a rake and skin all withered like a dried rook thereto as cold and dreary as a snake that seemed to tremble evermore and quake all in a canvas thin he was bedight and girded with a belt of twisted brake upon his head he wore and helmet light made of a dead men skull that seemed a ghastly sighed maleger was his name and after him there followed fast at hand two wicked hags with hoary locks all lose and visage grim their feet unshod their bodies wrapped in rags and both as swift on foot as chased stags and yet the one her other leg had lame which with a staff all full of little snags she did disport and impotence her name but th'other was impatience armed with raging flame soon as the carl from far the prince espied glistering in arms and warlike ornament his beast he felly pricked on either side and his mischievous bow full ready bent with which at him a cruel shaft he sent but he was wary and it warded well upon his shield that it no further went but to the ground the idle quarrel fell then he another and another did expel which to prevent the prince his mortal spear soon to him reached and fierce at him did ride to be avenged of that shot whilere but he was not so hardy to abide that bitter stound but turning quick aside his lightfoot beast fled fast away for fear whom to pursue the infant after hide so fast as his good courser could him bear but labour lost it was to ween approach him near for as the winged wind his tiger fled that view of eye could scarce him overtake ne scarce his feet on ground were seen to tread through hills and dales he speedy way did make ne hedge ne ditch his ready passage brake and in his flight the villain turned his face as wonts the tartar by the caspian lake when as the russian him in fight does chase unto his tigers tail and shot at him apace apace he shot and yet he fled apace still as the greedy knight nigh to him drew and oftentimes he would relent his pace that him his foe more fiercely should pursue who when his uncouth manner he did view he gan avise to follow him no more but keep his standing and his shafts eschew until he quite had spent his perilous store and then assail him fresh ere he could shift for more but that lame hag still as abroad he strew his wicked arrows gathered them again and to him brought fresh battle to renew which he espying cast her to restrain from yielding succour to that cursed swain and her attaching thought her hands to tie but soon as him dismounted on the plain that other hag did far away espy binding her sister she to him ran hastily and catching hold of him as down he lent him backward overthrew and down him stayed with their rude hands and griefly grapplement till that the ville in coming to their aye upon him fell and load upon him laid full little wanted but he had him slain and of the battle baleful end had made had not his gentle squire beheld his pain and come to his rescue ere his bitter bane so greatest and most glorious thing on ground may often need the help of weaker hand so feeble is men state and life unsound that in assurance it may never stand till it dissolved be from earthly band proof be thou prince the prowest man alive and noblest born of all in briton land yet thee fierce fortune did so nearly driven that had not grace thee blessed thou shouldst not revive the squire arriving fiercely in his arms snatched first the one and then the other jade his chiefest lets and authors of his harms and them perforce withheld with threatened blade lest that his lord they should behind invade the while the prince pricked with reproachful shame as one awaked out of long slumbering shade reviving thought of glory and of fame united all his powers to purge himself from blame like as a fire the which in hollow cave hath long be underkept and down suppressed with murmurous disdain does inly rave and grudge in so straight prison to be pressed at last breaks forth with furious unrest and strives to mount unto his native seat all that did erst it hinder and molest it now devours with flames and scorching heat and carries into smoke with rage and horror great so mightily the briton prince him roused out of his hold and broke his caitiff bans and as a bear whom angry curs have touzed having offshaked them and escaped their hands becomes more fell and all that him withstands treads down and overthrows now had the carl alighted from his tiger and his hands discharged of his bow and deadly quar'le to seize upon his foe flat lying on the marl which now him turned to disadvantage deer for neither can he fly nor other harm but trust unto his strength and manhood mere sith now he is far from his monstrous swarm and of his weapons did himself disarm the knight yet wrathful for his late disgrace fiercely advanced his valorous right arm and him so soar smote with his iron mace that groveling to the ground he fell and filled his place well weened he that field was then his own and all his labour brought to happy end when sudden up the villain overthrown out of his swown arose fresh to contend and gan himself to second battle bend as hurt he had not be thereby there lay and huge great stone which stood upon one end and had not be removed many a day some landmark seemed to be or sign of sundry way the same he snatched and with exceeding sway threw at his foe who was right well aware to shun the engine of his meant decay it booted not to think that throw to bear but ground he gave and lightly leapt arear eft fierce returning as a falcon fair that once hath failed of her souse full near remounts again into the open air and unto better fortune does her self prepare so brave returning with his brandished blade he to the carl himself again addressed and struck at him so sternly that he made and open passage through his riven breast that half the steel behind his back did rest which drawing back he looked evermore when the heart blood should gush out of his chest or his dead corpse should fallen upon the flore but his dead corpse upon the flore fell nathemore ne drop of blood appeared shed to be all were the wound so wide and wondrous that through his carcase one might plainly see half in a maze with horror hideous and half in rage to be deluded thus again through both the sides he struck him quite that made his spright to groan full piteous yet nathemore forth fled his groaning spright but freshly as at first prepared himself to fight thereat he smitten was with great affright and trembling terror did his heart appall ne wist he what to think of that same sighed ne what to say ne what to do at all he doubted lest it were some magical illusion that did beguile his sense or wandering ghost that wanted funeral or aerie spirit under false pretence or hellish fiend raised up through devilish science his wonder far exceeded reasons reach that he began to doubt his dazzled sighed and oft of error did himself appeach flesh without blood a person without spright wounds without hurt a body without might that could do harm yet could not harmed be that could not die yet seemed a mortal wight that was most strong in most infirmity like did he never hear like did he never see a while he stood in this astonishment yet would he not for all his great dismay give over to effect his first intent and utmost means of victory assay or utmost issue of his own decay his own good sword mordure that never failed at need till now he lightly threw away and his bright shield that nought him now availed and with his naked hands him forcibly assailed betwixt his two mighty arms him up he snatched and crushed his carcase so against his breast that the disdainful soul he thence dispatched and idle breath all utterly expressed though when he felt him dead adown he cast the lumpish corpse unto the senseless ground adown he cast it with so puissant wrest that back again it did aloft rebound and gave against his mother earth a groanful sound as when ioues harness-bearing bird from high stoups at a flying heron with proud disdain the stone-dead quarry falls so forcibly that it rebounds against the lowly plain a second fallen redoubling back again then thought the prince all peril sure was passed and that he victor only did remain no sooner thought then that the carl as fast gan heap huge strokes on him as ere he down was cast nigh his wits end then wox amazed knight and thought his labour lost and travel vain against this lifeless shadow so to fight yet life he saw and felt his mighty main that while he marveled still did still him pain for thy he gan some other ways advise how to take life from that dead-living swain whom still he marked freshly to arise from earth & from her womb new spirits to reprise he then remembered well that had be said how earth his mother was and first him boar she eke so often as his life decayed did life with usury to him restore and raised him up much stronger then before so soon as he unto her womb did fallen therefore to ground he would him cast no more ne him commit to graven terrestrial but bear him far from hope of succour usual tho up he caught him betwixt his puissant hands and having scruzed out of his carrion corpse the loathful life now loosed from sinful bans upon his shoulders carried him perforce above three furlongs taking his full course until he came unto a standing lake him thereinto he threw without remorse ne stirred till hope of life did him forsake so end of that carls days and his own pains did make ▪ which when those wicked hags from far did spy like two mad dogs they ran about the lands and th'one of them with dreadful yelling cry throwing away her broken chains and bans and having quenched her burning fire brands headlong her self did cast into that lake but impotence with her own wilful hands one of malegers cursed darts did take so rived her trembling heart and wicked end did make thus now alone he conqueror remains though coming to his squire that kept his steed thought to have mounted but his feeble veins him failed thereto and served not his need through loss of blood which from his wounds did bleed that he began to faint and life decay but his good squire him helping up with speed with steadfast hand upon his horse did stay and led him to the castle by the beaten way where many grooms and squires ready were to take him from his steed full tenderly and eke the fairest alma met him there with balm and wine and costly spicery to comfort him in his infirmity eftsoons she caused him up to be conveyed and of his arms despoiled easily in sumptuous bed she made him to be laid and all the while his wounds were dressing by him stayed cant. xii guyon by palmers governance passing through perils great does overthrow the bower of bliss and acrasie defeat now begins this goodly frame of temperance fairly to rise and her adorned head to prick of highest praise forth to advance formerly grounded and fast settled on firm foundation of true bountihood and this brave knight that for this virtue fights now comes to point of that same perilous stead where pleasure dwells in sensual delights amongst thousand dangers & ten thousand magic mights two days now in that sea he sailed has ne ever land beheld ne living wight ne ought save peril still as he did pass though when appeared the third morrow bright upon the waves to spread her trembling light and hideous roaring far away they herd that all their senses filled with affright and straight they saw the raging surges reared up to the skies that them of drowning made afeard said then the boatman palmer steer aright and keep and even course for yonder way we needs must pass god do us well acquit that is the gulf of greediness they say that deep engorges all this world's prey which having swallowed up excessively he soon in vomit up again does lay and belches forth his superfluity that all the seas for fear do seem away to fly on th'other side and hideous rock is pight of mighty magnes stone whose craggy clift depending from on high dreadful to sighed over the waves his rugged arms does lift and threatens down to throw his ragged rift on who so comes nigh yet nigh it draws all passengers that none from it can shift for while they fly that gulfs devouring jaws they on this rock are rend and sunk in helpless waves forward they pass and strongly he them rows until they nigh unto that gulf arrive where stream more violent and greedy grows then he with all his puissance does strive to strike his oars and mightily does driven the hollow vessel through the threatfully wave which gaping wide to swallow them alive in th'huge abyss of his engulfing graven does roar at them in vain and with great terror rave they passing by that grisly mouth did see sucking the seas into his entrails deep that seemed more horrible then hell to be or that dark dreadful hold of tartare steep through which the damned ghosts done often creep back to the world bad livers to torment but nought that falls into this direful deep ne that approaches nigh the wide descent may back return but is condemned to be drowned on th'other side they saw that perilous rock threatening it self on them to ruinate on whose sharp cliffs the ribs of vessels broke and shivered ships which had be wrecked late yet stuck with carcases exanimate of such as having all their subtance spent in wanton joys and lusts intemperate did afterwards make shipwreck violent both of their life and fame for ever foully blended for thy this hight the rock of vile reproach a dangerous and detestable place to which nor fish nor fowl did once approach but yelling mews with seagulls hoarse and base and cormorants with birds of ravenous raze which still sat waiting on that wasteful clift for spoil of wretches whose unhappy case after lost credit and consumed thrift at last them driven hath to this despairful drift the palmer seeing them in safety past thus said behold ensamples in our sights of lustful luxury and thriftless waste what now is left of miserable wights which spent their looser days in lewd delights but shame and sad reproach here to be read by these rend relics speaking their ill plights let all that live hereby be counseled to shun rock of reproach and it as death to dreaded so forth they rowed and that ferryman with his stiff oars did brush the sea so strong that the hoar waters from his frigate ran and the light bubbles danced all along while the salt brine out of the billows sprung at last far off they many islands spy on every side floating the floods among then said the knight lo i the land descry therefore old sire thy course do thereunto apply that may not be said then the ferryman lest we unweeting hap to be fordone for those same islands seeming now and than are not firm land nor any certain won but straggling plots which to and from do run in the wide waters therefore are they hight the wandering islands therefore do them shun for they have oft drawn many a wandering wight into most deadly danger and distressed plighted yet well they seem to him that far does view both fair and fruitful and the ground dispread with grassy green of delectable hew and the tall trees with leaves appareled are decked with blossoms died in white and read that mote the passengers thereto allure but whosoever once hath fastened his foot thereon may never it recure but wanders ever more uncertain and unsure as th'isle of delos whilom men report amid th'aegaean sea long time did stray ne made for shipping any certain port till that latona traveling that way flying from iunoes wrath and hard assay of her fair twins was there delivered which afterwards did rule the night and day thenceforth it firmly was established and for apolloes honour highly herried they to him harken as beseems meet and pass on forward so their way does lie that one of those same islands which do fleet in the wide sea they needs must passen by which seemed so sweet and pleasant to the eye that it would tempt a man to touchen there upon the bank they sitting did espy a dainty damosel dressing of her hear by whom a little skippet floating did appear she them espying loud to them can call bidding them nigher draw unto the shore for she had cause to bufie them withal and therewith loudly laughed but nathemore would they once turn but kept on as afore which when she saw she left her locks undight and running to her boat withouten over from the departing land it launched light and after them did driven with all her power and might whom overtaking she in merry sort them gan to board and purpose diversely now feigning dalliance and wanton sport now throwing forth lewd words immodestly till that the palmer gan full bitterly her to rebuke for being lose and light which not abiding but more scornfully scoffing at him that did her justly wite she turned her boat about and from them rowed quite that was the wanton phoedria which late did ferry him over the idle lake whom nought regarding they kept on their gate and all her vain allurements did forsake when them the wary boatman thus bespoke here now behooves us well to avise and of our safety good heed to take for here before a perilous passage lies where many mermaids haunt making false melodies but by the way there is a great quicksand and a whirlpool of hidden jeopardy therefore sir palmer keep and even hand scarce had he said when hard at hand they spy that quicksand nigh with water covered but by the checked wave they did descry it plain and by the sea discoloured it called was the quicksand of unthriftihood they passing by a goodly ship did see laden from far with precious merchandise and bravely furnished as ship might be which through great disadventure or misprize her self had run into that hazardize whose mariners and merchant's with much toil laboured in vain to have recured their prize and the rich wares to save from piteous spoil but neither toil nor travel might her back recoil on th'other side they see that perilous pool that called was the vvhirlepoole of decay in which full many had with hapless dole been sunk of whom no memory did stay whose circled waters rapt with whirling sway like to a restless wheel still running round did covet as they passed by that way to draw the boat within the utmost bound of his wide labyrinth and then to have them drowned but heedful boatman strongly forth did stretch his brawny arms and all his body strain that utmost sandy breach they shortly fetch while the dreaded danger does behind remain sudden they see from midst of all the main the surging waters like a mountain rise and the great sea puffed up with proud disdain to swell above the measure of his guise as threatening to devour all that his pour despise the waves come rolling and the billows roar outrageously as they enraged were or wrathful neptune did them driven before his whirling chariot for exceeding fear for not one puff of wind there did appear that all the three thereat wox much afraid unweeting what such horror strange did rear eftsoones they saw and hideous host arrayed of huge sea monsters such as living sense dismayed most ugly shapes and horrible aspects such as dame nature self mote fear to see or shame that ever should so fowl defects from her most cunning hand escaped be all dreadful portraits of deformity spring-headed hydraes and sea-shouldering whale's great whirlpools which all fish make to flee bright scolopendraes armed with silver scales mighty monoceros with immeasured tails the dreadful fish that hath deserved the name of death and like him looks in dreadful hew the griefly wasserman that makes his game the flying ships with swiftness to pursue the horrible sea-satyre that does show his fearful face in time of greatest storm huge ziffius whom mariners eschew no less then rocks as travellers inform and greedy rosmarines with visages deform all these and thousand thousands many more and more deformed monsters thousand fold with dreadful noise and hollow rambling roar came rushing in the foamy waves enrolled which seemed to fly for fear them to behold ne wonder if these did the knight appall for all that here on earth we dreadful hold be but as bugs to fearen babes withal compared to the creatures in the seas entrail fear nought then said the palmer well advised for these same monsters are not these in deed but are into these fearful shapes disguised by that same wicked witch to work us dread and draw from on this journey to proceed tho lifting up his virtuous staff on high he smote the sea which calmed was with speed and all that dreadful army fast gan fly into great tethys bosom where they hidden lie quit from that danger forth their course they kept and as they went they herd a rueful cry of one that wailed and pitiful wept that through the sea the resounding plaints did fly at last they in and island did espy a seemly maiden sitting by the shore that with great sorrow and sad agony seemed some great misfortune to deplore and loud to them for succour called evermore which guyon hearing straight his palmer bad to steer the boat towards that doleful maid that he might know and ease her sorrow sad who him advising better to him said fair sir be not displeased if disobeyed for ill it were to harken to her cry for she is inly nothing ill payed but only womanish fine forgery your stubborn heart t'affect with frail infirmity to which when she your courage hath inclined through foolish pity then her guileful bait she will embosomed deeper in your mind and for your ruin at the last await the knight was ruled and the boatman strait held on his course with stayed steadfastness ne ever shrunk ne ever sought to bait his tired arms for toilsome weariness but with his oars did sweep the watery wilderness and now they nigh approached to the stead where as those mermaids dwelled it was a still and calmy bay on th'one side sheltered with the broad shadow of and hoary hill on th'other side and high rock toured still that betwixt them both a peasant port they made and did like and half theatre fulfil there those fiue sisters had continual trade and used to both themselves in that deceitful shade they were fair ladies till they fondly strived with the heliconian maids for mastery of whom they overcomen were deprived of their proud beauty and th'one moiety transformed to fish for their bold surquedry but upper half their hew retained still and their sweet skill in wonted melody which ever after they abused to ill t'allure weak travellers whom got they did kill so now to guyon as he passed by their pleasant tunes they sweetly thus applied oh thou fair son of gentle fairy thou art in mighty arms most magnified above all knights that ever battle tried oh turn thy rudder hitherward a while here may thy storm-beat vessel safely ride this is the port of rest from troublous toil the world's sweet in from pain & wearisome turmoil with that the rolling sea resounding soft in his big base them sitly answered and on the rock the waves breaking aloft a solemn mean unto them measured the while sweet zephirus loud whistled his triple a strange kind of harmony which guyons senses softly tickled that he the boatman bad row easily and let him hear some part of their rare melody but him the palmer from that vanity with temperate advice discounciled that they it passed and shortly gan descry the land to which their course they leveled when suddenly a gross fog over spread with his dull vapour all that desert has and heavens cheerful face enveloped that all things one and one as nothing was and this great universe seemed one confused mass thereat they greatly were dismayed ne wist how to direct their way in darkness wide but feared to wander in that wasteful missed for tumbling into mischief unespied worse is the danger hidden then descried suddenly and innumerable flight of harmful fowls about them fluttering cried and with their wicked wings them oft did smite and soar annoyed groping in that grisly night euen all the nation of unfortunate and fatal birds about them flocked were such as by nature men abhor and hate the ill-faced owl death's dreadful messenger the hoars night-raven trump of doleful drear the leather-winged bat days enemy the rueful strich still waiting on the bear the whistler shrill that who so hears does die the hellisn harpies prophets of sad destiny all those and all that else does horror breed about them flew and filled their sails with fear yet stayed they not but forward did proceed while th'one did row and th'other stiffly steer till that at last the weather gan to clear and the fair land it self did plainly show said then the palmer lo where does appear the sacred soil where all our perils grow therefore sirknight your ready arms about you throw he hearkened and his arms about him took the while the nimble boat so well her sped that with her crooked keel the land she struck then forth the noble guyon sallied and his sage palmer that him governed but th'other by his boat behind did stay they marched fairly forth of nought dreaded both firmly armed for every hard assay with constancy and care gainst danger and dismay ere long they herd and hideous bellowing of many beasts that roared outrageously as if that hunger's point or venus sting had them enraged with fell surquedry yet nought they feared but passed on hardily until they came in view of those wild beasts who all atonce gaping full greedily and rearing fiercely their upstarting crests ran towards to devour those unexpected guests but soon as they approached with deadly threat the palmer over them his staff upheld his mighty staff that could all charms defeat eftsoons their stubborn courages were quelled and high advanced crests down meekly felled in stead of fraying they them selves did fear and trembled as them passing they beheld such wondrous pour did in that staff appear all monsters to subdue to him that did it bear of that same wood it framed was cunningly of which caduceus whilom was made caduceus the rod of mercury with which he wonts the stygian realms invade through ghastly horror and eternal shade infernal fiends with it he can assuage and orcus tame whom nothing can persuade and rule the furyes when they most do rage such virtue in his staff had eke this palmer sage thence passing forth they shortly do arrive whereas the bower of bliss was situate a place pick out by choice of best alive that nature's work by art can imitate in which what ever in this worldly state is sweet and pleasing unto living sense or that may daintiest fantasy aggrate was poured forth with plentiful dispense and made there to abound with lavish affluence goodly it was enclosed round about aswell their entered guests to keep within as those unruly beasts to hold without yet was the fence thereof but weak and thin nought feared their force that fortilage to win but wisdoms pour and temperance's might by which the mightiest things efforced been and eke the gate was wrought of substance light rather for pleasure then for battery or fight it framed was of precious ivory that seemed a work of admirable wit and therein all the famous history of iason and medaea was writ her mighty charms her furious loving fit his goodly conquest of the golden fleece his falsed faith and love too lightly flit the wondered argo which in venturous piece first through the euxine seas boar all the flower of greece you might have seen the frothy billows fry under the ship as through them she went that seemed the waves were into ivory or ivory into the waves were sent and other where the snowy substance sprented with vermeil like the boys blood therein shed a piteous spectacle did represent and otherwhiles with gold besprinkled it seemed enchanted flame which did creiisa wed all this and more might in that goodly gate be read that ever open stood to all which thither came but in the porch there sat a comely personage of stature tall and semblance pleasing more then natural that travellers to him seemed to entice his looser garment to the ground did fallen and flew about his heals in wanton wise not fit for speedy pace or manly exercise they in that place him genius did call not that celestial pour to whom the care of life and generation of all that lives pertains in charge particular who wondrous things concerning our welfare and strange phantoms does let us oft foresee and oft of secret ill bids us beware that is our self whom though we do not see yet each does in him self it well perceive to be therefore a god him sage antiquity did wisely make and good agdistes call but this same was to that quite contrary the foe of life that good envies to all that secretly does us procure to fallen through guileful semblants which he makes us see he of this garden had the governal and pleasures porter was devised to be holding a staff in hand for more formality with diverse flowers he daintily was decked and strowed round about and by his side a mighty mazer bowl of wine was set as if it had to him be sacrificed wherewith all newcome guests he gratified so did he eke sir guyon passing by but he his idle courtesy defied and overthrew his bowl disdainfully and broke his staff with which he charmed semblants sly thus being entered they behold around a large and spacious plain on every side strowed with pleasance whose fair grassy ground mantled with grenee and goodly beautified with all the ornaments of floraes pride wherewith her mother art as half in scome of niggard nature like a pompous bride did deck her and too lavishly adorn when forth from virgin bower she comes in early morn thereto the heavens always jovial looked on them lovely still in steadfast state ne suffered storm nor frost on them to fallen their tender buds or leaves to violate nor scorching heat nor cold intemperate tafflict the crearures which therein did dwell but the mild air with season moderate gently attempered and disposed so well that still it breathed forth sweet spirit & wholesome smell more sweet and wholesome then the pleasant hill of rhodope on which the nymph that boar a giant babe her self for grief did kill or the thessalian tempe where of yore fair daphne phoebus heart with love did gore or ida where the gods loved to repair when ever they their heavenly bowers forlore or sweet parnasse the would unt of muses fair of eden if ought with eden mote compare much wondered guyon at the fair aspect of that sweet place yet suffered no delight to sink into his sense nor mind affect but passed forth and looked still forward right bridling his will and mastering his might till that he came unto another gate no gate but like one being goodly dight with boughs and branches which did broad dilate their clasping arms in wanton wreathings intricate so fashioned a porch with rare device arched over head with and embracing vine whose bunches hanging down seemed to entice all passers by to taste their luscious wine and did themselves into their hands incline as freely offering to be gathered some deep empurpled as the hyacint some as the ruby laughing sweetly read some like fair emeralds not yet well ripened and them among some were of burnished gold so made by art to beautify the rest which did themselves amongst the leaves enfold as lurking from the view of covetous guest that the weak bows with so rich load oppressed did bow adown as overburdened under that porch a comely dame did rest clad in fair weeds but fowl disordered and garments lose that seemed unmeet for womanhood in her left hand a cup of gold she held and with her right the riper fruit did reach whose sappy liquour that with fullness swelled into her cup she scruzed with dainty breach of her fine fingers without fowl impeach that so fair winepress made the wine more sweet thereof she used to give to drink to each whom passing by she happened to meet it was her guise all strangers goodly so to greet so she to gayon offered it to taste who taking it out of her tender hound the cup to ground did violently cast that all in pieces it was broken found and with the liquour stained all the land whereat excess exceedingly was wroth yet no'te the same amend ne yet withstand but suffered him to pass all were she loath who not regarding her displeasure forward goes there the mod dainty paradise on ground it self does offer to his sober eye in which all pleasures plenteously abound and none does others happiness envy the painted flowers the trees upshooting high the dales for shade the hills for breathing space the trembling groves the crystal running by and that which all fair works does most aggrace the art which all that wrought appeared in no place one would have thought so cunningly the rude and scorned parts were mingled with the fine that nature had for wantonness ensued art and that art at nature did repine so striving each th'other to undermine each did the others work more beautify so differing both in wills agreed in fine so all agreed through sweet diversity this garden to adorn with all variety and in the midst of all a fountain stood of richest substance that on earth might be so pure and shiny that the silver flood through every channel running one might see most goodly it with curious imagery was overwrought and shapes of naked boys of which some seemed with lively jollity to fly about playing their wanton toys whilst others did themselves embay in liquid joys and over all of purest gold was spread a trail of ivy in his native hew for the rich mettle was so coloured that wight who did not well advised it view would surely deem it to be ivy true low his lascivious arms down did creep that themselves dipping in the silver due their fleecy flowers they tenderly did steep which drops of crystal seemed for wantons to weep infinite streams continually did well out of this fountain sweet and fair to see the which into and ample laver fell and shortly grew to so great quantity that like a little lake it seemed to be whose depth exceeded not three cubits hight that through the waves one might the bortom see all paved beneath with jasper shining bright that seemed the fountain in that sea did sail upright and all the margin round about was set with shady laurel trees thence to defend the sunny beams which on the billows bet and those which therein bathed mote offend as guyon happened by the same to weened two naked damsels he therein espied which therein bathing seemed to contend and wrestle wantonly ne cared to hide their dainty parts from view of any which them eyed sometime the one would lift the other quite above the waters and then down again her plunge as over mastered by might where both awhile would covered remain and each the other from to rise restrain the while their snowy limbs as through a veil so through the crystal waves appeared plain then suddenly both would themselves unheal and amorous sweet spoils to greedy eyes reveal as that fair star the messenger of morn his dewy face out of the sea does rear or as the cyprian goddess newly born of oceans fruitful froth did first appear such seemed they and so their yellow hear christalline humour dropped down apace whom such when guyon saw he drew him near and somewhat gan relent his earnest pace his stubborn breast gan secret pleasance to embrace the wanton maidens him espying stood gazing a while at his unwonted guise then th'one her self low ducked in the flood abashed that her a stranger did a vise but th'other rather higher did arise and her two lily paps aloft displayed and all that might his melting heart entice to her delights she unto him bewrayed the rest hid underneath him more desirous made with that the other likewise up arose and her fair locks which formerly were bound up in one knot she low adown did loose which flowing long and thick her clothed around and ivory in golden mantle gowned so that fair spectacle from him was rest yet that which rest it no less fair was found so hid in locks and waves from lookers theft nought but her lovely face she for his looking left withal she laughed and she blushed withal that blushing to her laughter gave more grace and laughter to her blushing as did fallen now when they spied the knight to slack his pace them to behold and in his sparkling face the secret signs of kindled lust appear their wanton merriments they did increase and to him beckoned to approach more near and showed him many sights that courage cold could rear on which when gazing him the palmer saw he much rebuked those wandering eyes of his and counseled well him forward thence did draw now are they come nigh to the bower of bliss of her found favorites so named amiss when thus the palmer now sir well avise for here the end of all our travel is here wones acrasia whom we must surprise else she will slip away and all our drift despise eftsoones they herd a most melodious found of all that mote delight a dainty ear such as atonce might not on living ground save in this paradise be herd elsewhere right hard it was for wight which did it hear to read what manner music that mote be for all that pleasing is to living ear was there consorted in one harmony birds voices instruments winds waters all agree the joyous birds shrouded in cheerful shade their notes unto the voice attempered sweet the angelical soft trembling voices made to instruments divine respondence meet the silver sounding instruments did meet with the base murmur of the waters fallen the waters fallen with difference discreet now soft now loud unto the wind did call the gentle warbling wind low answered to all there whence that music seemed herd to be was the fair witch her self now solacing with a new lover whom through sorcery and witchcraft she from far did thither bring there she had him now laid a slumbering in secret shade after long wanton joys while round about them pleasantly did sing many fair ladies and lascivious boys that ever mixed their song with light licentious toys and all that while right over him she hung with her false eyes fast fixed in his sighed as seeking medicine whence she was stung or greedily depasturing delight and oft inclining down with kisses light for fear of waking him his lips bedewed and through his humid eyes did suck his spright quite melted into lust and pleasure lewd wherewith she sighed soft as if his case she rued the while some one did chant this lovely lay ah see who so fair thing dost feign to see in springing flower the image of thy day ah see the virgin rose how sweetly she does first peep forth with bashful modesty that fairer seems the less you see her may lo see soon after how more bold and free her bared bosom she does broad display lo see soon after how she fades and falls away so passes in the passing of a day of mortal life the leaf the bud the flower ne more does flourish after first decay

whilst yet is time whilst loving thou mayest loved be with equal crime he ceased and then gan all the choir of birds their diverse notes attune unto his lay as in approvance of his pleasing words the constant pair herd all that he did say yet swerved not but kept their forward way through many covert groves and thickets close in which they creeping did at last display that wanton lady with her lover loose whose sleepy head she in her lap did soft dispose upon a bed of roses she was laid as faint through heat or dight to pleasant since and was arrayed or rather disarrayed all in a veil of silk and silver thin that hid no whit her alabaster skin but rather showed more white if more might be more subtle web arachne can not spin nor the fine nets which oft we woven see of scorched dew do not in th'aire more lightly flee her snowy breast was bore to ready spoil of hungry eyes which no'te therewith be filled and yet through languour of her late sweet toil few drops more clear then nectar forth distilled that like pure orient pearls adown it trilled and her fair eyes sweet smiling in delight moistened their fiery beams with which she thrilled frail hearts yet quenched not like starry light which sparkling on the silent waves does seem more bright the young man sleeping by her seemed to be some goodly swain of honourable place that certes it great pity was to see him his nobility so foul deface a sweet regard and amiable grace mixed with manly sternness did appear yet sleeping in his well proportioned face and on his tender lips the downy hear did now but freshly spring and silken blossoms bear his warlike arms the idle instruments of sleeping praise were hung upon a tree and his brave shield full of old monuments was foully razed that none the signs might see ne for them ne for honour cared he ne ought that did to his advancement tend but in lewd loves and wasteful luxury his days his goods his body he did spend oh horrible enchantment that him so did blend the noble elf and careful palmer drew so nigh them minding nought but lustful game that sudden forth they on them rushed and threw a subtle net which only for the same the skilful palmer formally did frame so held them under fast the while the rest fled all away for fear of fouler shame the fair enchantress so unwares oppressed tried all her arts & all her sleights thence out to wrest and eke her lover strove but all in vain for that same net so cunningly was wound that neither guile nor force might it distrain they took them both & both them strongly bound in captive bands which there they ready found but her in chains of adamant he tied for nothing else might keep her safe and found but verdant so he hight he soon untied and counsel sage in steed thereof to him applied but all those pleasant bowers and palace brave guyon broke down with rigour pitiless ne ought their goodly workmanship might save them from the tempest of his wrathfulness but that their bliss he turned to balefulness their groves he felled their gardens did deface their arbours spoiled their cabinets suppress their banquet houses burn their buildings raze and of the fairest late now made the foulest place then led they her away and eke that knight they with them led both sorrowful and sad the way they came the same returned they right till they arrived where they lately had charmed those wild-beasts that raged with fury mad which now awaking fierce at them gan fly as in their mistress rescue whom they led but them the palmer soon did pacify then guyon asked what meant those beasts which there didly said he these seeming beasts are men indeed whom this enchantress hath transformed thus whilom her lovers which her lustest did feed now turned into figures hideous according to their minds like monstruous sad end quoth he of life intemperate and mournful meed of joys delicious but palmer if it mote thee so aggrate let them returned be unto their former state straight way he with his virtuous staff them struck and straight of beasts they comely men became yet being men they did unmanly look and stared ghastly some for inward shame and some for wrath to see their captive dame but one above the rest in special that had and hog been late hight grille by name repined greatly and did him miscall that had from hoggish form him brought to natural said guyon see the mind of beastly man that hath so soon forgotten the excellence of his creation when he life began that now he chooses with vile difference to be a beast and lack intelligence to whom the palmer thus the dunghill kind delights in filth and foul incontinence let grill be grill and have his hoggish mind but let us hence depart whilst weather serves and wind the third booke of the faerie qveene

but the captived acrasia he sent because of travel long a nigher way with a strong guard all rescue to prevent and her to faery court safe to convey that her for witness of his hard assay unto his faery queen he might present but he himself betook another way to make more trial of his hardiment and seek adventures as he with prince arthur went long so they traveled through wasteful ways where dangers dwelled and perils most did won to hunt for glory and renowned praise full many countries they did overrun from the uprising to the setting sun and many hard adventures did achieve of all the which they honour ever won seeking the weak oppressed to relieve and to recover right for such as wrong did grieve at last as through and open plain they yode they spied a knight that towards pricked fair and him beside and aged squire there road that seemed to couch under his shield three-square as if that age bade him that burden spare and yield it those that stouter could it wield he them espying gan himself prepare and on his arm address his goodly shield that boar a lion passant in a golden field which seeing good sir guyon deer besought the prince of grace to let him run that turn he granted then the fairy quickly reached his poignant spear and sharply gan to spurn his foamy steed whose fiery feet did burn the verdant grass as he thereon did tread ne did the other back his foot return but fiercely forward came withouten dread and bent his dreadful spear against the others head they be met and both their points arrived but guyon drove so furious and fell that seemed both shield & plate it would have rived natheless it boar his foe not from his fell but made him stagger as he were not well but guyon self ere well he was aware nigh a spears length behind his crouper fell yet in his fallen so well him self he bore that mischievous mischance his life & limbs did spare great shame and sorrow of that fallen he took for never yet sith warlike arms he boar and shivering spear in bloody field first shook he found himself dishonoured so soar ah gentlest knight that ever armour boar let not thee grieve dismounted to have been and brought to ground that never wast before for not thy fault but secret pour unseen that spear enchanted was which laid thee on the green but weenedest thou what wight thee overthrew much greater grief and shamefuller regret for thy hard fortune then thou wouldst renew that of a single damosel thou wertenberg met on equal plain and there so hard beset even the famous britomart it was whom strange adventure did from britaine fetched to seek her lover love far sought alas whose image she had feene in venus looking glass full of disdainful wrath he fierce uprose for to revenge that foul reproachful shame and snatching his bright sword began to close with her on foot and stoutly forward came die rather would he then endure that same which when his palmer saw he gan to fear his towards peril and untoward blame which by that new rencounter he should rear for death sat on the point of that enchanted spear and hasting towards him gan fair persuade not to provoke misfortune nor to ween his spears default to mend with cruel blade for by his mighty science he had seen the secret virtue of that weapon keen that mortal puissance mote not withstand nothing on earth mote always happy been great hazard were it and adventure found to lose long got honour with one evil hound by such good means he him discounciled from prosecuting his revenging rage and eke the prince like treaty handled his wrathful will with reason to assuage and laid the blame not to his carriage but to his starting steed that swerved aside and to the ill purveyance of his page that had his furnitures not firmly tied so is his angry courage fairly pacified thus reconcilement was between them knit through goodly temperance and affection chaste and either vowed with all their power and wit to let not others honour be defaced of friend or foe who ever it embased ne arms to bear against the others side in which accord the prince was also placed and with that golden chain of concord tied so goodly all agreed they forth yfere did ride o goodly usage of those antique times in which the sword was servant unto right when not for malice and contentious crimes but all for praise and proof of manly might the martial brood accustomed to fight then honour was the meed of victory and yet the vanquished had no despite let later age that noble use envy vile rancour to avoid and cruel surquedry long they thus traveled in friendly wise through countries waste and eke well edified seeking adventures hard to exercise their puissance whilom full dernly tried at length they came into a forest wide whose hideous horror and sad trembling found full grisly seemed therein they long did ride yet tract of living creatures none they found save bears lions & bulls which roamed them around all suddenly out of the thickest brush upon a milkwhite palfrey all alone a goodly lady did foreby them rush whose face did seem as clear as crystal stone and eke through fear as white as whale's bone her garments all were wrought of beaten gold and all her steed with tinsel trappings shone which fled so fast that nothing mote him hold and scarce them leisure gave her passing to behold still as she fled her eye she backward threw as fearing evil that pursued her fast and her fair yellow locks behind her flew loosely dispersed with puff of every blast all as a blazing star does far outcast his hairy beams and flaming locks dispread at sighed whereof the people stand aghast but the sage wizard tells as he has read that it importunes death and doleful drearihood so as they gazed after her a while lo where a grisly foster forth did rush breathing out beastly lust her to defile his tireling jade he fiercely forth did push through thick and thin both over bank and bush in hope her to attain by hook or crook that from his gory sides the blood did gush large were his limbs and terrible his look and in his clownish hand a sharp boar spear he shook which outrage when those gentle knights did see full of great envy and fell jealousy they stayed not to avise who first should be but all spurred after fast as they mote fly to rescue her from shameful villainy the prince and guyon equally belive her self pursued in hope to win thereby most goodly meed the fairest dame alive but after the foul foster timias did strive the while fair britomart whose constant mind would not so lightly follow beauty's chase ne recked of ladies love did stay behind and them awaited there a certain space to weet if they would turn back to that place but when she saw them gone she forward went as lay her journey through that perilous pace with steadfast courage and stout hardiment ne evil thing she feared ne evil thing she meant at last as nigh out of the wood she came a stately castle far away she spied to which her steps directly she did frame that castle was most goodly edified and placed for pleasure nigh that forest side but fair before the gate a spacious plain mantled with green it self did spreaden wide on which she saw sixe knights that did deraign fierce battle against one with cruel might and main mainly they all atonce upon him laid and soar beset on every side around that nigh he breathless grew yet nought dismayed ne ever to them yielded foot of ground all had he lost much blood through many a wound but stoutly dealt his blows and every way to which he turned in his wrathful stound made them recoil and fly from dreaded decay that none of all the sixe before him durst assay like dastard curs that having at a bay the salvage beast embossed in weary chase dare not adventure on the stubborn prey ne bite before but room from place to place to get a snatch when turned is his face in such distress and doubtful jeopardy when britomart him saw she ran a pace unto his rescue and with earnest cry bade those same sixe forbear that single enemy but to her cry they list not land ear ne ought the more their mighty strokes surcease but gathering him round about more near their direful rancour rather did increase till that she rushing through the thickest press perforce disparted their compacted gyre and soon compelled to harken unto peace though gan she mildly of them to inquire the cause of their dissension and outrageous ire whereto that single knight did answer frame these sixe would me enforce by odds of might to change my lief and love another dame that death me liefer were then such despite so unto wrong to yield my wrested right for i love one the truest one on ground ne list me change she th'errant damosel hight for whose deer sake full many a bitter stound i have endured and tasted many a bloody wound certes said she then be you sixe to blame to ween your wrong by force to justify for knight to leave his lady were great shame that faithful is and better were to die all loss is less and less the infamy then loss of love to him that loves but one ne may love be compelled by mastery for soon as mastery comes sweet love anon takes his nimble wings and soon away is gone then spoke one of those sixe there dwells here within this castle wall a lady fair whose sovereign beauty hath no living peer thereto so bounteous and so debonair that never any mote with her compare she hath ordained this law which we approve that every knight which does this way repair in case he have no lady nor no love shall do unto her service never to remove but if he have a lady or a love then must he her forgo with foul defame or else with us by dint of sword approve that she is fairer then our fairest dame as did this knight before you hither came perdie said britomart the choice is hard but what reward had he that overcame he should advanced be to high regard said they and have our ladies love for his reward therefore a read sir if thou have a love love have i sure quoth she but lady none yet will i not from mine own love remove ne to your lady will i service done but wreak your wrongs wrought to this knight alone and prove his cause with that her mortal spear she mightily adventured towards one and down him smote ere well aware he wear then to the next she road & down the next did bear ne did she stay till three on ground she laid that none of them himself could rear again the fourth was by that other knight dismayed all were he weary of his former pain that now there do but two of six remain which two did yield before she did them smite ah said she then now may you all see plain that truth is strong and true love most of might that for his trusty servants does so strongly fight too well we see said they and prove too well our faulty weakness and your matchless might for thy fair sir yours be the damosel which by her own law to your lot does light and we your liege men faith unto you plighted so underneath her feet their swords they shared and after her besought well as they might to enter in and reap the due reward she granted and then in they all together fared long were it to describe the goodly frame and stately port of castle joyous for so that castle hight by commune name where they were entertained with courteous and comely glee of many gracious fair ladies and many a gentle knight who through a chamber long and spacious eftsoons them brought unto their ladies sighed that of them cleped was the lady of delight but for to tell the sumptuous array of that great chamber should be labour lost for living wit i ween cannot display the royal riches and exceeding cost of every pillar and of every post which all of purest bullion framed were and with great pearls and precious stones embossed that the bright glister of their beams clear did sparkle forth great light and glorious did appear these stranger knights through passing forth were led into and inner room whose royalty and rich purveyance might uneath be read mote princes place be seem so decked to be which stately manner when as they did see the image of superfluous riotise exceeding much the state of mean degree they greatly wondered whence so sumptuous guise might be maintained and each gan diversely devise the walls were round about appareled with costly clothes of arras and of toure in which with cunning hand was portrayed the love of venus and her paramour the fair adonis turned to a flower a work of rare device and wondrous wit first did it show the bitter baleful stour which her assayed with many a fervent fit when first her tender heart was with his beauty smit then with what sleights and sweet allurements she enticed the boy as well that art she knew and wooed him her paramour to be now making girlands of each flower that grew to crown his golden locks with honour due now leading him into a secret shade from his beauperes and from bright heavens view where him to sleep she gently would persuade or bathe him in a fountain by some covert glade and while he slept she over him would spread her mantle coloured like the starry skies and her soft arm lay underneath his head and with ambrosial kisses bathe his eyes and whilst he bathed with her two crafty spies she secretly would search each dainty limb and throw into the well sweet rosemaries and fragrant violets and pances trim and ever with sweet nectar she did sprinkle him so did she steal his heedless heart away and joyed his love in secret unespied but for she saw him bent to cruel play to hunt the salvage beast in forest wide dreadful of danger that mote him betide she oft and oft advised him to refrain from chase of greater beasts whose brutish pride mote breed him scathe unwares but all in vain for who can shun the chance that destiny does ordain lo where beyond he lies languishing deadly engored of a great wild boar and by his side the goddess groveling makes for him endless moan and evermore with her soft garment wipes away the gore which stains his snowy skin with hateful hew but when she saw no help might him restore him to a dainty flower she did transmew which in that cloth was wrought as if it lively grew so was that chamber clad in goodly wise and round about it many beds were dight as whilom was the antique world's guise some for untimely ease some for delight as pleased them to use that use it might and all was full of damsels and of squires dancing and reveling both day and night and swimming deep in sensual desires and cupid still amongst them kindled lustful fires and all the while sweet music did divide her looser notes with lydian harmony and all the while sweet birds thereto applied their dainty lays and dulcet melody ay caroling of love and jollity that wonder was to hear their trim consort which when those knights beheld with scornful eye they disdained such lascivious disport and loathed the lose demeanour of that wanton sort thence they were brought to that great ladies view whom they found sitting on a sumptuous bed that glistered all with gold and glorious show as the proud persian queens accustomed she seemed a woman of great bountihood and of rare beauty saving that askance her wanton eyes ill signs of womanhood did roll too highly and too often glance without regard of grace or comely amenance long work it were and needless to devise their goodly entertainment and great glee she caused them be led in courteous wise into a bower disarmed for to be and cheered well with wine and spicery the redcrosse knight was soon disarmed there but the brave maid would not disarmed be but only vented up her umbriere and so did let her goodly visage to appear as when fair cynthia in dark some night is in a noyous cloud enveloped where she may find the substance thin and light breaks forth her silver beams and her bright head discovers to the world discomfited of the poor traveller that went astray with thousand blessings she is herried such was the beauty and the shining ray with which fair britomart gave light unto the day and eke those six which lately with her fought now were disarmed and did them selves present unto her view and company unsought for they all seemed courteous and gent and all sixe brothers born of one parent which had them trained in all civility and goodly taught to tilt and tournament now were they liegemen to this lady free and her knights service ought to hold of her in fee the first of them by name gardante hight aiolly person and of comely view the second was parlante a bold knight and next to him iocante did ensue basciante did him self most courteous show but fierce bacchante seemed too fell and keen and yet in armies noctante greater grew all were fair knights and goodly well beseen but to fair britomart they all but shadows been for she was full of amiable grace and manly terror mixed therewithal that as the one stirred up affections base so th'other did men's rash desires appall and hold them back that would in error fallen as he that hath espied a vermeil rose to which sharp thorns and briers the way forestall dare not for dread his hardy hand expose but wishing it far off his idle wish does loose whom when the lady saw so fair a wight all ignorant of her contrary sex for she her weened a fresh and lusty knight she greatly gan enamoured to wex and with vain thoughts her falsed fancy vex her fickle heart conceived hasty fire like sparks of fire which fallen in slender flex that shortly brent into extreme desire and ransacked all her veins with passion entire eftsoones she grew to great impatience and into terms of open outrage burst that plain discovered her incontinence ne recked she who her meaning did mistrust for she was given all to fleshly lust and poured forth in sensual delight that all regard of shame she had discussed and meet respect of honour put to flight so shameless beauty soon becomes a loathy sighed fair ladies that to love captived are and chaste desires do nourish in your mind let not her fault your sweet affections mar ne blot the bounty of all womankind amongst thousands good one wanton dame to find amongst the roses grow some wicked weeds for this was not to love but lust inclined for love does always bring forth bounteous deeds and in each gentle heart desire of honour breeds nought so of love this looser dame did skill but as a coal to kindle fleshly flame giving the bridle to her wanton will and treading under foot her honest name such love is hate and such desire is shame still did she rove at her with crafty glance of her false eyes that at her heart did aim and told her meaning in her countenance but britomart dissembled it with ignorance supper was shortly dight and down they sat where they were served with all sumptuous fare while fruitful ceres and lyaeus sat poured out their plenty without spite or spare nought wanted there that dainty was and rare and aye the cups their banks did overflow and aye between the cups she did prepare way to her love and secret darts did throw but britomart would not such guileful message know so when they slaked had the fervent heat of appetite with meats of every sort the lady did fair britomart entreat her to disarm and with delightful sport to lose her warlike limbs and strong effort but when she mote not thereunto be won for she her sex under that strange purport did use to hide and plain appearance shun in plainer wise to tell her grievance she begun and all atonce discovered her desire with sighs and sobs and plaints & piteous grief the outward sparks of her in burning fire which spent in vain at last she told her brief that but if she did lend her short relief and do her comfort she mote algates die but the chaste damosel that had never proof of such malengine and fine forgery did easily believe her strong extremity full easy was for her to have belief who by self-feel of her feeble sex and by long trial of the inward grief wherewith imperious love her heart did vex could judge what pains do loving hearts perplex who means no guile beguiled soonest shall and to fair semblance does light faith annex the bird that knows not the false fowlers call into his hidden net full easily does fallen for thy she would not in discourteous wise scorn the fair offer of good will professed for great rebuke it is love to despise or rudely disdain a gentle hearts request but with fair countenance as beseemed best her entertained natheless she inly deemed her love too light to woo a wandering guest which she misconstruing thereby esteemed that from like inward fire that outward smoke had steamed therewith a while she her flit fancy fed till she mote win fit time for her desire but yet her wound still inward freshly bled and through her bones the false instilled fire did spread it self and venom close inspire tho were the tables taken all away and every knight and every gentle squire can choose his dame with basciomani gay with whom he meant to make his sport & courtly play some fell to dance some fell to hazardry some to make love some to make merriment as diverse wits to diverse things apply and all the while fair malecasta bent her crafty engines to her close intent by this th'eternall lamps wherewith high love does light the lower world were half spent and the moist daughters of huge atlas strove into the ocean deep to driven their weary drove high time it seemed then for every wight them to betake unto their kindly rest eftsoons long waxed torches weren light unto their bowers to guiden every guest though when the britonesse saw all the rest avoided quite she gan her self despoil and safe commit to her soft fetherednest where through long watch & late days weary toil she soundly slept & careful thoughts did quite assoil now when as all the world in silence deep shrouded was and every mortal wight was drowned in the depth of deadly sleep fair malecasta whose engrieved spright could find no rest in such perplexed plighted lightly arose out of her weary bed and under the black veil of guilty night her with a scarlet mantle covered that was with gold and ermines fair enveloped then panting soft and trembling every joint her fearful feet towards the bower she moved where she for secret purpose did appoint to lodge the warlike maid unwisely loved and to her bed approaching first she proved whither she slept or waked with her soft hand she softly felt if any member moved and lent her weary ear to understand if any puff of breath or sign of sense she found which whenas none she found with easy snift for fear lest her unwares she should abraid th'embroderd quilt she lightly up did lift and by her side her self she softly laid of every finest fingers touch afraid ne any noise she made ne word she spoke but inly sighed at last the royal maid out of her quiet slumber did awake and changed her weary side the better ease to take where feeling one close couched by her side she lightly leapt out of her filed bed and to her weapon ran in mind to gride the loathed lecher but the dame half dead through sudden fear and ghastly drearihood did shriek aloud that through the house it rung and the whole family therewith dreaded rashly out of their roused couches sprung and to the troubled chamber all in arms did throng and those six knights that ladies champions and eke the redcrosse knight ran to the stound half armed and half unarmed with them atonce where when confusedly they came they found their lady lying on the senseless ground on th'other side they saw the warlike maid all in her snow-white smock with locks unbound threatening the point of her avenging blade that with so troublous terror they were all dismayed about their lady first they flocked around whom having laid in comfortable couch shortly they reared out of her frozen swoon and afterwards they gan with fowl reproach to stir up strife and troublous conteck broach but by ensample of the last days loss none of them rashly durst to her approach ne in so glorious spoil themselves embossed her succoured eke the champion of the bloody cross but one of those sixe knights gardante hight drew out a deadly bow and arrow keen which forth he sent with felonous despite and fell intent against the virgin sheen the mortal steel stayed not till it was seen to gore her side yet was the wound not deep but lightly rased her soft silken skin that drops of purple blood thereout did weep which did her lily smock with stains of vermeil steep wherewith enraged she fiercely at them flew and with her flaming sword about her laid that none of them foul mischief could eschew but with her dreadful strokes were all dismayed here there and every where about her swayed her wrathful steel that none mote it a bide and eke the redcrosse knight gave her good aid ay joining foot to foot and side to side that in short space their foes they have quite terrified tho whenas all were put to shameful flight the noble britomartis her arrayed and her bright arms about her body dight for nothing would she longer there be stayed where so lose life and so ungentle trade was used of knights and ladies seeming gent so early ere the gross earth's greasy shade was all dispersed out of the firmament they took their steeds & forth upon their journey went cant. ii the redcrosse knight to britomart describeth artegall the wondrous mirror by which she in love with him did fallen here have i cause in men just blame to find that in their proper praise too partial be and not indifferent to woman kind to whom no share in arms and chivalry they do impart ne maken memory of their brave gests and prowese martial scarce do they spare to one or two or three room in their writs yet the same writing small does all their deeds deface and dims their glories all but by record of anqique times i find that women wont in wars to bear most sway and to all great exploits them self inclined of which they still the garland boar away till envious men fearing their rules decay gan coin straight laws to curb their liberty yet sith they warlike arms have laid away they have excelled in arts and policy that now we foolish men that praise gin eker'enuy of warlike puissance in ages spent be thou fair britomart whose praise i write but of all wisdom be thou precedent endite i would as duty does excite but ah my rhymes too rude and rugged are when in so high and object they do lite and striving fit to make i fear do mar thy self thy praises tell and make them known far she travelling with guyon by the way of sundry things fair purpose gan to find abridge their journey long and lingering day amongst which it fell into that fairies mind to ask this briton maid what uncouth wind made her dissemble her disguised kind fair lady she him seemed like lady dressed but fairest knight alive when armed washer breast thereat she sighing softly had no pour to speak a while ne ready answer make but with heart-thrilling throbs and bitter stour as if she had a fever fit did quake and every dainty limb with horror shake and ever and anon the rosy read flashed through her face as it had been a flake oflightning through bright heaven fulmined at last the passion passed she thus him answered fair sir i let you weet that from the hour i taken was from nurse's tender pap i have been trained up in warlike stour to tossen spear and shield and to affrap the warlike rider to his most mishap since i loathed have my life to led as ladies wont in pleasures wanton lap to finger the fine needle and nice thread me lever were with point of foeman's spear be dead all my delights deeds of arms is set to hunt out perils and adventures hard by sea by land where so they may be met only for honour and for high regard without respect of richesse or reward for such intent into these parts i came withouten compass or withouten carded far from my native soil that is by name the greater britaine here to seek for praise and fame fame blazed hath that here in fairy land do many famous knights and ladies won and many strange adventures to be found of which great worth and worship may be won which i to prove this voyage have begun but mote i weet of you right courteous knight tidings of one that hath unto me done late foul dishonour and reproachful spite the which i seek to wreak and arthegall he hight the word gone out she back again would call as her repenting so to have missaid but that he it uptaking ere the fallen her shortly answered fair martial maid certes you misa vised been upbraid a gentle knight with so unknightly blame for weet you well of all that ever played at tilt or tourney or like warlike game the noble arthegall hath ever born the name for thy great wonder were it if such shame should ever enter in his bounteous thought or ever do that mote deserven blame the noble courage never weens ought that may unworthy of it self be thought therefore fair damosel be you well aware lest that too far you have your sorrow sought you and your country both i wish welfare and honour both for each of other worthy are the royal maid wox inly wondrous glad to hear her love so highly magnified and joyed that ever she affixed had her heart on knight so goodly glorified how ever finely she it feigned to hide the loving mother that nine months did bear in the deer closet of her pain full side her tender babe it seeing safe appear does not so much rejoice as she rejoiced there but to occasion him to further talk to feed her humour with his pleasing style her list in strifeful terms with him to balk and thus replied how ever sir you file your courteous tongue his praises to compile it ill beseems a knight of gentle sort such as you have him boasted to beguile a simple maid and work so heinous tort in shame of knighthood as i largely can report let be therefore my vengeance to dissuade and read where i that faitour false may find ah but if reason fair might you persuade to slake your wrath and mollify your mind said he perhaps you should it better find for hardy thing it is to ween by might that man to hard conditions to bind or ever hope to match in equal fight whose prowess paragon saw never living wight ne soothlich is it easy for to read where now on earth or how he may be found for he ne wones in one certain stead but restless walks all the world around ay doing things that to his same redound defending ladies cause and orphans right where so he hears that any does confound them comfortless through tyranny or might so is his sovereign honour raised to heavens hight his feeling words her feeble sense much pleased and softly sunk into her melted heart heart that is inly hurt is greatly eased with hope of thing that may allege his smart for pleasing words are like to magic art that does the charmed snake in slumber lay such secret ease felt gentle britomart yet list the same efforce with feigned gainsay so discord oft in music makes the sweeter lay and said sir knight these idle terms forbear and sith it is uneath to find his haunt tell me some marks by which he may appear if chance i him encounter paravant for perdy one shall other slay or daunt what shape what shield what arms what steed what stead and what so else his person most may vaunt all which the redcrosse knight to point aread and him in every part before her fashioned yet him in every part before she knew how ever list her now her knowledge feign sith him whilom in britaine she did view to her revealed in a mirror plain whereof did grow her first engrafted pain whose root and stalk so bitter yet did taste that but the fruit more sweetness did contain her wretched days in dolour she mote wast and yield the prey of love to loathsome death at last by strange occasion she did him behold and much more strangely gan to love his sighed as it in books hath written be of old in deheubarth that now south-wales is hight what time king ryence reigned and dealed right the great magician merlin had devise by his deep science and hell-dreaded might a looking glass right wondrously aguised whose virtues through the wide world soon were solemnized it virtue had to show in perfect sighed what ever thing was in the world contained betwixt the lowest earth and heavens hight so that it to the looker appertained what ever foe had wrought or friend had feigned therein discovered was ne ought mote pass ne ought in secret from the same remained for thy it round and hollow shaped was like to the world it self and seemed a world of glass who wonders not that reads so wondrous work but who does wonder that has read the tower wherein the egyptian phaeo long did lurk from all men's view that none might her discover yet she might all men view out of her bower great ptolomaee it for his leman's sake builded all of glass by magic pour and also it impregnable did make yet when his love was false he with a pease it brake such was the glassy globe that merlin made and gave unto king ryence for his guard that never foes his kingdom might invade but he it knew at home before he hard tidings thereof and so them still debarred it was a famous present for a prince and worthy work of infinite reward that treasons could bewray and foes convince happy this realm had it remained ever since one day it fortuned fair britomart into her father's closet to repair for nothing he from her reserved apart being his only daughter and his hair where when she had espied that mirror fair her self a while therein she viewed in vain though her advising of the virtues rare which thereof spoken were she gan again her to be think of that mote to her self pertain but as it falls in the gentlest hearts imperious love hath highest set his throne and tyrannizes in the bitter smarts of them that to him buxom are and prove so thought this maid as maidens use to done whom fortune for her husband would allot not that she lusted after any one for she was pure from blame of sinful blot yet wist her life at last must link in that same knot eftsoones there was presented to her eye a comely knight all armed in complete wise through whose bright ventail lifted up on high his manly face that did his foes agrise and friends to terms of gentle truce entice looked forth as phoebus face out of the east betwixt two shady mountains does arise portly his person was and much increased through his heroic grace and honourable gest his crest was covered with a couchant hound and all his armour seemed of antique mould but wondrous massy and assured found and round about fretted all with gold in which there written was with ciphers old achilles arms which arthegall did win and on his shield enveloped sevenfold he boar a crowned little ermilin that decked the azure field with her fair powdered skin the damosel well did view his personage and like well ne further fastened not but went her way ne her unguilty age did ween unwares that her unlucky lot lay hidden in the bottom of the pot of hurt vnwift most danger does redound but the false archer which that arrow shot so slyly that she did not feel the wound did smile full smoothly at her weetless woeful stound thenceforth the feather in her lofty crest ruffed of love gan lowly to avail and her proud portance and her princely gest with which she erst triumphed now did quail sad solemn sour and full of fancies frail she wox yet wist she neither how nor why she wist not silly maid what she did ail yet wist she was not well at ease perdy yet thought it was not love but some melancholy so soon as night had with her pallid hew defaced the beauty of the shining sky and reft from men the world's desired view she with her nurse adown to sleep did lie but sleep full far away from her did fly in stead there of fad sighs and sorrows deep kept watch and ward about her warily that nought she did but wail and often steep her dainty couch with tears which closely she did weep and if that any drop of slumbering rest did chance to still into her weary spright when feeble nature felt her self oppressed straight way with dreams and with fantastic sighed of dreadful things the same was put to flight that oft out of her bed she did astart as one with view of ghastly fiends affright though gan she to renew her former smart and think of that fair visage written in her heart one night when she was tossed with such unrest her aged nurse whose name was glauce hight feeling her leap out of her loathed nest betwixt her feeble arms her quickly catched and down again in her warm bed her dight ah my deer daughter ah my dearest dread what uncouth fit said she what evil plighted hath thee oppressed and with sad drearihood changed thy lively cheer and living made thee dead for not of nought these sudden ghastly fears all night afflict thy natural repose and all the day when as thine equal pears their fit disports with fair delight do chosen thou in dull corners dost thy self enclose ne tastest princes pleasures ne dost spread abroad thy fresh youths fairest flower but loose both leaf and fruit both too untimely shed as one in wilful bale for ever buried the time that mortal men their weary cares do lay away and all wild beasts do rest and every river eke his course forbears then does this wicked evil thee infest and rive with thousand throbs thy thrilled breast like and huge aetn ' of deep engulfed grief sorrow is heaped in thy hollow chest whence forth it breaks in sighs and anguish rife as smoke and sulphur mingled with confused strife aye me how much i fear least love it be but if that love it be as sure i read by known signs and passion which i see be it worthy of thy raze and royal seed then i avow by this most sacred head of my deer foster child to ease thy grief and win thy will therefore away do dread for death nor danger from thy due relief shall me debar tell me therefore my liefest lief so having said her betwixt her arms twaine she straightly strained and colled tenderly and every trembling joint and every vain she softly felt and rubbed busily to do the frozen cold away to fly and her fair dewy eyes with kisses deer she oft did both and oft again did dry and ever her importuned not to fear to let the secret of her heart to her appear the damosel paused and then thus fearfully ah nurse what needs thee to eke my pain is not enough that i alone do die but it must doubled be with death of twaine for nought for me but death there does remain o daughter deer said she despair no whit for never soar but might a salve obtain that blinded god which hath you blindly smit another arrow hath your lovers heart to hit but mine is not quoth she like others wound for which no reason can find remedy was never such but mote the like be found said she and though no reason may apply salve to your soar yet love can higher stye then reasons reach and oft hath wonders done but neither god of love nor god of sky can do said she that which cannot be done things oft impossible quoth she seem ere begun these idle words said she do nought assuage my stubborn smart but more annoyance breed for no no usual fire no usual rage it is o nurse which on my life does feed and sucks the blood which from my heart does bleed but since thy faithful zeal lets me not hide my crime if crime it be i will it reed nor prince nor peer it is whose love hath gride my feeble breast of late and launched this wound wide nor man it is nor other living wight for then some hope i might unto me draw but only shade and semblant of a knight whose shape or person yet i never saw hath me subjected to loves cruel law the same one day as me misfortune led i in my father's wondrous mirror saw and pleased with that seeming goodlihead unwares the hidden hook with bait i swallowed since it hath infixed faster hold within my bleeding bowels and so soar now rankles in this same frail fleshly mould that all mine entrails flow with poisonous gore and ulcer grows daily more and more ne can my running soar find remedy other then my hard fortune to deplore and languish as the leaf fallen from the tree till death make one end of my days and misery daughter said she what need you be dismayed or why make you such monster of your mind of much more uncouth thing i was afraid of filthy lust contrary unto kind but this affection nothing strange i find for who with reason can you aye reprove to love the semblant pleasing most your mind and yield your heart whence you cannot remove no guilt in you but in the tyranny of love not so the arabian myrrh did set her mind not so did biblis spend her pining heart but loved their native flesh against all kind and to their purpose used wicked art yet played pasiphaë a more monstrous part that loved a bull and learned a beast to be such shameful lustest who loathes not which depart from course of nature and of modesty sweet love such lewdness bans from his fair company but thine my dear welfare thy heart my deer though strange beginning had yet fixed is on one that worthy may perhaps appear and certes seems bestowed not amiss joy thereof have thou and eternal bliss with that upleaning on her elbow weak her alablasted breast she soft did kiss which all that while she felt to pant and quake as it and earthquake were at last she thus bespoke beldame your words do work me little ease for though my love be not so lewdly bent as those you blame yet may it nought appease my raging smart ne ought my flame relent but rather does my helpless grief augment for they how ever shameful and unkind yet did possess their horrible intent short end of sorrows they thereby did find so was their fortune good though wicked were their mind but wicked fortune mine though mind be good can have no end nor hope of my desire but feed on shadows while i die for food and like a shadow wax while with entire affection i do languish and expire i fonder then cephisus foolish child who having viewed in a fountain shear his face was with the love thereof beguiled i fonder love a shade the body far exiled nought like quoth she for that same wretched boy was of himself the idle paramour both love and lover without hope of joy for which he faded to a watery flower but better fortune thine and better hour which lovest the shadow of a warlike knight no shadow but a body hath in pour that body wheresoever that it light may learned be by ciphers or by magic might but if thou may with reason yet repress the growing evil ere it strength have god and thee abandoned wholly do possess against it strongly strive and yield thee not till thou in open field adown be smote but if the passion master thy frail might so that needs love or death must be thy lot then i avow to thee by wrong or right to compass thy desire and find that loved knight her cheerful words much cheered the feeble spright of the sick virgin that her down she laid in her warm bed to sleep if that she might and the old-woman carefully displayed the clothes about her round with busy aid so that at last a little creeping sleep surprised her sense she therewith well payed the drunken lamp down in the oil did steep and set her by to watch and set her by to weep early the morrow next before that day his joyous face did to the world reveal they both uprose and took their ready way unto the church their prayers to appeal with great devotion and with little zeal for the fair damosel from the holy hearse her lovesick heart to other thoughts did steal and that old dame said many and idle verse out of her daughters heart found fancies to reverse returned home the royal infant fell into her former fit for why no pour nor guidance of her self in her did dwell but aged nurse her calling to her bower had gathered rew and savine and the flower of camphara and calamint and dill all which she in a earthen pot did pour and to the brim with colt wood did it fill and many drops of milk and blood through it did spill then taking thrice three hairs from off her head them trebly braided in a threefold lace and round about the pots mouth bound the thread and after having whispered a space certain sad words with hollow voice and base she to the virgin said thrice said she it come daughter come come spit upon my face spit thrice upon me thrice upon me spit uneven number for this business is most fit that said her round about she from her turned she turned her contrary to the sun thrice she her turned contrary and returned all contrary for she the right did shun and ever what she did was straight undone so thought she to undo her daughters love but love that is in gentle breast begun no idle charms so lightly may remove that well can witness who by trial it does prove ne ought it mote the noble maid avail ne slake the fury of her cruel flame but that she still did waste and still did wail that through long laugour and heartburning brame she shortly like a pined ghost became which long hath waited by the stygian strand that when old glauce saw for fear least blame of her miscarriage should in her be found she wist not how amend nor how it to withstand cant. iii merlin betrays to britomart the state of artegall and shows the famous progeny which from them springen shall most sacred fire that burnest mightily in living breasts kindled first above amongst th'eternall spheres and lamping sky and thence poured into men which men call love not that same which does base affections move in brutish minds and filthy lust inflame but that sweet fit that does true beauty love and chooses virtue for his dearest dame whence spring all noble deeds and never dying fame well did antiquity a god thee deem that over mortal minds hast so great might to order them as best to thee does seem and all their actions to direct aright the fatal purpose of divine foresight thou dost effect in destined descents through deep impression of thy secret might and stirredst up th'heroes high intents which the late world admires for wondrous monuments but thy dread darts in none do triumph more ne braver proof in any of thy pour shewedst thou then in this royal maid of yore making her seek and unknown paramour from the world's end through many a bitter stour from whose two loins thou afterwards did raise most famous fruits of matrimonial bower which through the earth have spread their living praise that fame in trump of gold eternally displays begin then o my dearest sacred dame daughter of phoebus and of memory that dost ennoble with immortal name the warlike worthies from antiquity in thy great volume of eternity begin o clio and recount from hence my glorious sovereigns goodly auncestie till that by due degrees and long pretence thou have it lastly brought unto her excellence full many ways within her troubled mind old glauce cast to cure this ladies grief full many ways she sought but none could find nor herbs nor charms nor counsel that is chief and choicest medicine for sick hearts relief for thy great care she took and greater fear lest that it should her turn to foul reprieve and soar reproach when so her father deer should of his dearest daughters hard misfortune hear at last she her advised that he which made that mirror wherein the sick damosel so strangely viewed her strange lovers shade to weet the learned merlin well could tell under what coast of heaven the man did dwell and by what means his love might best be wrought for though beyond the africk ismaell or th'indian peru he were she thought him forth through infinite endeavour to have sought forthwith themselves disguising both in strange and base attire that none might them bewray to maridunum that is now by change of name cayr-merdin called they took their way there the wise merlin whilom wont they say to make his won low underneath the ground in a deep delve far from the view of day that of no living wight he mote be found when so he counseled with his sprights encompassed round and if thou ever happen that same way to travel go to see that dreadful place it is and hideous hollow cave they say under a rock that lies a little space from the swift barry tumbling down apace amongst the woody hills of dyneuowre but dare thou not i charge in any case to enter into that same baleful bower for fear the cruel fiends should thee unwares devour but standing high aloft low lay thine ear and there such ghastly noise of iron chains and brazen cauldrons thou shalt rambling hear which thousand sprights with long enduring pains do toss that it will stun thy feeble brains and oftentimes great groans and grievous stounds when too huge toil and labour them constrains and oftentimes loud strokes and ringing sounds from under that deep rock most horribly rebounds the cause some say is this a little while before that merlin died he did intend a brazen wall in compass to compile about cairmardin and did it commend unto these sprights to bring to perfect end during which work the lady of the lake whom long he loved for him in haste did send who thereby forced his workmen to forsake them bound till his return their labour not to slake in the mean time through that false ladies train he was surprised and buried under bear ne ever to his work returned again natheless those fiends may not their work forbear so greatly his commandment they fear but there do toil and travel day and night until that brazen wall they up do rear for merlin had in magic more insight then ever him before or after living wight for he by words could call out of the sky both sun and moon and make them him obey the land to sea and sea to mainland dry and darksome night he eke could turn to day huge hosts of men he could alone dismay and hosts of men of meanest things could frame when so him list his enemies to fray that to this day for terror of his fame the fiends do quake when any him to them does name and sooth men say that he was not the son of mortal sire or other living wight but wondrously begotten and begun by false illusion of a guileful spright on a fair lady nonne that whilom hight matilda daughter to pubidius who was the lord of mathrauall by right and cousin unto king ambrosius whence he endued was with skill so marvelous they here arriving stayed a while without ne durst adventure rashly in to weened but of their first intent gan make new doubt for dread of danger which it might portend until the hardy maid with love to friend first entering the dreadful mage there found deep busied bout work of wondrous end and writing strange characters in the ground with which the stubborn fiends he to his service bound he nought was moved at their entrance bold for of their coming well he wist afore yet list them bid their business to unfold as if ought in this world in secret store were from him hidden or unknown of yore then glauce thus let not it thee offend that we thus rashly through thy darksome door unwares have pressed for either fatal end or other mighty cause us two did hither send he bade tell on and then she thus began now have three moons with borrowed brother's light thrice shined fair and thrice seemed dim and wan sith a soar evil which this virgin bright torments and does plunge in doleful plighted first rooting took but what thing it mote be or whence it sprung i cannot read aright but this i read that but if remedy thou her afford full shortly i her dead shall see therewith th'enchaunter softly gan to smile at her smooth speeches weeting inly well that she to him dissembled womanish guile and to her said beldame by that you tell more need of leechcraft hath your damosel then of my skill who help may have elsewhere in vain seeks wonders out of magic spell th'old woman wox half blank those words to hear and yet was loath to let her purpose plain appear and to him said if any leeches skill or other learned means could have redressed this my deer daughters deep engrafted ill certes i should be loath thee to molest but this sad evil which does her infest does course of natural cause far exceed and housed is within her hollow breast that either seems some cursed witches deed or evil spright that in her does such torment breed the wizard could no longer bear her board but bursting forth in laughter to her said glauce what needs this colourable word to cloak the cause that hath it self bewrayed ne you fair britomartis thus arrayed more hidden are then sun in cloudy veil whom thy good fortune having fate obeyed hath hither brought for succour to appeal the which the powers to thee are pleased to reveal the doubtful maid seeing her self descried was all abashed and her pure ivory into a clear carnation sudden died as fair aurora rising hastily does by her blushing tell that she did lie all night in old tithonus frozen bed whereof she seems ashamed inwardly but her old nurse was nought disheartened but vantage made of that which merlin had aread and said sith then thou knowest all our grief for what dost not thou know of grace i pray pity our plaint and yield us meet relief with that the prophet still a while did stay and then his spirit thus gan forth display most noble virgin that by fatal lore hast learned to love let no whit thee dismay the hard begin that meets thee in the door and with sharp fits thy tender heart oppresses soar for so must all things excellent begin and eke enrooted deep must be that tree whose big embodied branches shall not lin till

causes to their constant term the man whom heavens have ordained to be the spouse of britomart is arthegall he wones in the land of fairy yet is no fairy born ne sib at all to elves but sprung of seed

sudden fit and half ecstatic stour when the two fearful women saw they grew greatly confused in behaviour at last the fury past to former hew she turned again and cheerful looks did show then when them selves they well instructed had of all that needed them to be inquired they both conceiving hope of comfort glad with lighter hearts unto their home retired where they in secret counsel close conspired how to effect so hard and enterprise and to possess the purpose they desired now this now that betwixt them they did devise and diverse plots did frame to mask in strange devise at last the nurse in her foolhardy wit conceived a bold devise and thus bespoke daughter i deem that counsel aye most fit that of the time does due advantage take you see that good king vther now does make strong war upon the paynim brothers hight octa and oza whom he lately brake beside cayr verolame in victorious fight that now all britanie does burn in arms bright that therefore nought our passage may impeach let us in feigned arms our selves disguise and our weak hands whom need new strength shall teach the dreadful spear and shield to exercise ne certes daughter that same warlike wise i ween would you misseem for you be tall and large of limb achieve and hard emprise ne ought you want but skill which practice small will bring and shortly make you a maid martial and sooth it ought your courage much inflame to hear so often in that royal house from whence to none inferior you came bards tell of many women valorous which have full many feats adventurous performed in paragon of proudest men the bold bunduca whose victorious exploits made room to quake stout guendolen renowned martia and redoubted emmilen and that which more then all the rest may sway late days ensample which these eyes beheld in the last field before meneuia which vther with those foreign pagans held i saw a saxon virgin the which felled great vlfin thrice upon the bloody plain and had not carados her hand withheld from rash revenge she had him surely slain yet carados himself from her escaped with pain ah read quoth britomart how is she hight fair angela quoth she men do her call no whit less fair then terrible in fight she hath the leading of a martial and mighty people dreaded more then all the other saxons which do for her sake and love themselves of her name angles call therefore fair infant her ensample make unto thy self and equal courage to thee take her hearty words so deep into the mind of the young damosel sunk that great desire of warlike arms in her forthwith they tined and generous stout courage did inspire that she resolved vnmeeting to her sire adventurous knighthood on her self to done and counseled with her nurse her maids attire to turn into a massy habergeon and bade her all things put in readiness anon th'old woman nought that needed did omit but all things did conuiently purvey it fortuned so time their turn did fit a band of britons riding on foray few dries before had got a great prey of saxon goods amongst the which was seen a goodly armour and full rich array which longed to angela the saxon queen all fretted round with gold and goodly well beseen the same with all the other ornaments king ryence caused to be hanged high in his chief church for endless monuments of his success and gladful victory of which her self advising readily in evening late old glauce thither led fair britomart and that same armoury down taking her therein appareled well as she might and with brave baldric garnished beside those arms there stood a mighty spear which bladud made by magic art of yore and used the same in battle aye to bear sith which it had been here preserved in store for his great virtues proved long afore for never wight so fast in fell could fit but him perforce unto the ground it boar both spear she took and shield which hung by it both spear & shield of great pour for her purpose fit thus when she had the virgin all arrayed another harness which did hang thereby about her self she dight that the young maid she might in equal arms accompany and as her squire attend her carefully though to their ready steeds they climbed full light and through back ways that none might them espy covered with secret cloud of silent night themselves they forth conveyed & passed forward right ne rested they till that to fairy land they came as merlin them directed late where meeting with this redcrosse knight she found of diverse things discourses to dilate but most of arthegall and his estate at last their ways so fell that they mote part then each to other well affectionate friendship professed with unfeigned heart the redcrosse knight diversed but forth road britomart cant. iiii bold marinell of britomart is thrown on the rich strand fair florimell of arthur is long followed but not found where is the antique glory now become that whilom wont in women to appear where be the brave achievements done by some where be the battles where the shield and spear and all the conquests which them high did rear that matter made for famous poets verse and boastful men so oft abashed to hear bene they all dead and laid in doleful hearse or done they only sleep and shall again reverse if they be dead then woe is me therefore but if they sleep o let them soon awake for all too long i burn with envy soar to hear the warlike feats which homere spoke of bold panthesilee which made a lake of greekish blood so oft in trojan plain but when i read how stout debora strake proud sisera and how camill ' hath slain the huge orsilochus i swell with great disdain yet these and all that else had puissance cannot with noble britomart compare aswell for glory of great valiance as for pure chastity and virtue rare that all her goodly deeds do well declare well worthy stock from which the branches sprung that in late years so fair a blossom bore as thee o queen the matter of my song whose lineage from this lady i derive along who when through speeches with the redcrosse knight she learned had th'estate of arthegall and in each point her self informed aright a friendly league of love perpetual she with him bound and congé took withal then he forth on his journey did proceed to seek adventures which mote him befall and win him worship through his warlike deed which always of his pains he made the chiefest meed but britomart kept on her former course ne ever doffed her arms but all the way grew pensive through that amorous discourse by which the redcrosse knight did erst display her lovers shape and chivalrous array a thousand thoughts she fashioned in her mind and in her feigning fancy did portray him such as fittest she for love could find wise warlike personable courteous and kind with such self-pleasing thoughts her wound she fed and thought so to beguile her grievous smart but so her smart was much more grievous bred and the deep wound more deep engored her heart that nought but death her dolour mote depart so forth she road without repose or rest searching all lands and each remotest part following the guidance of her blinded guest till that to the seacoast at length she her address there she a lighted from her lightfoot beast and sitting down upon the rocky shore bade her old squire unlace her lofty crest though having viewed a while the surges hoar that gainst the craggy cliffs did loudly roar and in their raging surquedry disdained that the fast earth affronted them so soar and their devouring covetise restrained thereat she sighed deep and after thus complained huge sea of sorrow and tempestuous grief wherein my feeble bark is tossed long far from the hoped haven of relief who do thy cruel billows beatrice so strong and thy moist mountains each on others throng threatening to swallow up my fearful life o do thy cruel wrath and spiteful wrong at length allay and stint thy stormy strife which in these troubled bowels reigns & rages rife for else my feeble vessel crazed and cracked through thy strong buffets and outrageous blows cannot endure but needs it must be wracked on the rough rocks or on the sandy shallows the while that love it steers and fortune rows love my lewd pilot hath a restless mind and fortune boatswain no assurance knows but sail withouten stars gainst tide and wind how can they other do sith both are bold and blind thou god of winds that reignest in the seas that reignest also in the continent at last blow up some gentle gale of ease the which may bring my ship ere it be rend unto the gladsome port of her intent then when i shall my self in safety see a table for eternal monument of thy great grace and my great jeopardy great neptune i avow to hallow unto thee then sighing softly soar and inly deep she shut up all her plaint in privy grief for her great courage would not let her weep till that old glauce gan with sharp reprieve her to restrain and give her good relief through hope of those which merlin had her told should of her name and nation be chief and fetch their being from the sacred mould of her immortal womb to be in heaven enrolled thus as she her recomforted she spied where far away one all in armour bright with hasty gallop towards her did ride her dolour soon she ceased and on her dight her helmet to her courser mounting light her former sorrow into sudden wrath both cousin passion of distroubled spright converting forth she beats the dusty path love and despite atonce her courage kindled hath as when a foggy missed hath overcast the face of heaven and the clear air engrossed the world in darkness dwells till that at last the watery southwind from the seaboard cost upblowing does disperse the vapour lost and pours it self forth in a stormy shower so the fair britomart having disclosed her cloudy care into a wrathful stour the missed of grief dissolved into vengeance pour eftsoons her goodly shield addressing fair that mortal spear she in her hand did take and unto battle did her self prepare the knight approaching sternly her bespoke sir knight that dost thy voyage rashly make by this forbidden way in my despite ne dost by others death ensample take i read thee soon retire while thou hast might lest afterwards it be too late to take thy flight thrilled with deep disdain of his proud threat she shortly thus fly they that need to fly words fearen babes i mean not thee entreat to pass but maugre thee will pass or die ne longer stayed for th'other to reply but with sharp spears the rest made dearly known srongly the strange knight ran and sturdily struck her full on the breast that made her down decline her head & touch her crouper with her crown but she again him in the shield did smite with so fierce fury and great puissance that through his threesquare scutcheon piercing quite and through his mailed hauberque by mischance the wicked steel through his left side did glance him so transfixed she before her boar beyond his croup the length of all her lance till sadly sousing on the sandy shore he tumbled on and heap and wallowed in his gore like as the sacred ox that careless stands with gilded horns and flowery girlands crowned proud of his dying honour and deer bans while altars fume with frankincense around all suddenly with mortal stroke astounded does groveling fallen and with his streaming gore distains the pillars and the holy ground and the fair flowers that decked him afore so fell proud marinell upon the precious shore the martial maid stayed not him to lament but forward road and kept her ready way along the strand which as she overwent she saw bestrewed all with rich array of pearls and precious stones of great assay and all the gravel mixed with golden our whereat she wondered much but would not stay for gold or pearls or precious stones and hour but them despised all for all was in her pour while thus he lay in deadly stonishment tidings hereof came to his mother's ear his mother was the black-browed cymoent the daughter of great nereus which did bear this warlike son unto and earthly pear the famous dumarin who on a day finding the nymph a sleep in secret where as he by chance did wander that same way was taken with her love and by her closely lay there he this knight of her begotten whom born she of his father marinell did name and in a rocky cave as wight forlorn long time she fostered up till he became a mighty man at arms and much fame did get through great adventures by him done for never man he suffered by that same rich strand to travel whereas he did won but that he must do battle with the sea-nymph's son and hundred knights of honourable name he had subdued and them his vassals made that through all fairy land his noble fame now blazed was and fear did all invade that none durst passen through that perilous glade and to advance his name and glory more her sea-god sire she dearly did persuade endow her son with treasure and rich store above all the sons that were of earthly wombs borne the god did grant his daughters deer demand to done his nephew in all riches flow eftsoons his heaped waves he did command out of their hollow bosom forth to throw all the huge treasure which the sea below had in his greedy gulf devoured deep and him enriched through the overthrow and wrecks of many wretches which did weep and often wail their wealth which he from them did keep shortly upon that shore there heaped was exceeding riches and all precious things the spoil of all the world that it did pass the wealth of east and pomp of persian kings gold amber ivory pearls ouches rings and all that else was precious and deer the sea unto him voluntary brings that shortly he a great lord did appear as was in all the land of fairy or elsewhere thereto he was a doughty dreaded knight tried often to the scathe of many deer that none in equal arms him matchen might the which his mother seeing gan to fear lest his too haughty hardiness might rear some hard mishap in hazard of his life for thy she oft him counseled to forbear the bloody battle and to stir up strife but after all his war to rest his weary knife and for his more assurance she inquired one day of proteus by his mighty spell for proteus was with prophecy inspired her deer sons destiny to her to tell and the sad end of her sweet marinell who through foresight of his eternal skill bade her from womankind to keep him well for of a woman he should have much ill a virgin strange and stout him should dismay or kill for thy she gave him warning every day the love of women not to entertain a lesson too too hard for living clay from love in course of nature to refrain yet he his mother's lore did well retain and ever from fair ladies love did fly yet many ladies fair did oft complain that they for love of him would algates die die who so list for him he was loves enemy but ah who can deceive his destiny or ween by warning to avoid his fate that when he sleeps in most security and safest seems him soonest does amate and finds due effect or soon or late so feeble is the pour of fleshly arm his mother bade him women's love to hate for she of woman's force did fear no harm so weening to have armed him she did quite disarm this was that woman this that deadly wound that proteus prophesied should him dismay the which his mother vainly did expound to be heart-wounding love which should assay to bring her son unto his last decay so tickle be the terms of mortal state and full of subtle sophisms which do play with double senses and with false debate tapproue the unknown purpose of eternal fate too true the famous marinell it found who through late trial on that wealthy strand inglorious now lies in senseless swoon through heavy stroke of britomartis hound which when his mother deer did understand and heavy tidings herd whereas she played among her watery sisters by a pond gathering sweet daffodils to have made gay girlands from the sun their foreheads fair to shade eftsoones both flowers and girlands far away she flung and her fair dewy locks rent to sorrow huge she turned her former play and gameson mirth to grievous dreariment she threw her self down on the continent ne word did speak but lay as in a swown while all her sisters did for her lament with yelling outcries and with shrieking sown and every one did tear her garland from her crown soon as she up out of her deadly fit arose she bade her chariot to be brought and all her sisters that with her did fit bade eke atonce their charets to be sought though full of bitter grief and pensive thought she to her wagon climbed climbed all the rest and forth together went with sorrow fraught the waves obedient to their behest them yielded ready passage and their rage surceased great neptune stood amazed at their sighed while on his broad round back they softly slid and eke himself mourned at their mournful plighted yet wist not what their wailing meant yet did for great compassion of their sorrow bid his mighty waters to them buxom be eftsoons the roaring billows still abided and all the griefly monsters of the see stood gaping at their gate and wondered them to see a teem of dolphins ranged in array drew the smooth chariot of sad cymoent they were all taught by triton to obey to the long trains at her commandment as swift as swallows on the waves they went that their broad flaggy fins no foam did rear ne bubbling roundel they behind them sent the rest of other fish drawn wear which with their finny oars the swelling sea did shear soon as they be arrived upon the brim of the rich strand their charets they forlore and let their teemed fish softly swim along the margin of the foamy shore lest they their fins should bruise and surbate soar their tender feet upon the stony ground and coming to the place where all in gore and cruddy blood enwallowed they found the luckless marinell lying in deadly swoon his mother swooned thrice and the third time could scarce recovered be out of her pain had she not be devoid of mortal slime she should not then have be relived again but soon as life recovered had the rain she made so piteous moan and deer waiment that the hard rocks could scarce from tears refrain and all her sister nymphs with one consent supplied her sobbing breaches with sad compliment dear image of my self she said that is the wretched son of wretched mother born is this thine high advancement o is this th'immortall name with which thee yet unborn thy grandsire nereus promised to adorn now liest thou of life and honour reft now liest thou a lump of earth forlorn ne of thy late life memory is left ne can thy irrevocable destiny be wove found proteus father of false prophecies and they more found that credit to thee give not this the work of woman's hand ywis that so deep wound through these deer members driven i feared love but they that love do live but they that die do neither love nor hate natheless to thee thy folly i forgive and to my self and to accursed fate the guilt i do ascribe deer wisdom bought too late o what avails it of immortal seed to been bred and never born to die far better i it deem to die with speed then waste in woe and wailful misery who dies the utmost dolour does aby but who that lives is left to wail his loss so life is loss and death felicity sad life worse then glad death and greater cross to see friends graven them dead the graven self to engross but if the heavens did his days envy and my short bliss malign yet mote they well thus much afford me ere that he did die that the dim eyes of my deer marinell i mote have closed and him bed farewell sith other offices for mother meet they would not grant yet maugre them farewell my sweetest sweet farewell my sweetest son sith we no more shall meet thus when they all had sorrowed their fill they softly gan to search his grisly wound and that they might him handle more at will they him disarmed and spreading on the ground their watchet mantles fringed with silver round they softly wiped away the jelly blood from orifice which having well upbound they poured in sovereign balm and nectar good good both for earthly medicine and for heavenly food tho when the lily handed liagore this liagore whilom had learned skill in leeches craft by great appolloes lore sith her whilom upon high pindus hill he loved and at last her womb did fill with heavenly seed whereof wise paeon sprung did feel his pulse she knew their stayed still some little life his feeble sprites among which to his mother told despair she from her flung tho up him taking in their tender hands they easily unto her chariot bear her teem at her commandment quiet stands while they the corpse into her wagon rear and strow with flowers the lamentable bear then all the rest into their coaches clime and through the brackish waves their passage shear upon great neptunes neck they softly swim and to her watery chamber swiftly carry him deep in the bottom of the sea her bower is built of hollow billows heaped high like to thick clouds that threat a stormy shower and vaunted all within like to the sky in which the gods do dwell eternally there they him laid in easy couch well dight and sent in haste for tryphon to apply salves to his wounds and medicines of might for tryphon of sea gods the sovereign leach is hight the while the nymphs fit all about him round lamenting his mishap and heavy plighted and oft his mother viewing his wide wound cursed the hand that did so deadly smite her dearest son her dearest hearts delight but none of all those curses overtook the warlike maid ensample of that might but fairly well she thrived and well did brook her noble deeds ne her right course for ought forsook yet did false archimage her still pursue to bring to pass his mischievous intent now that he had her singled from the crew of courteous knights the prince and fairy gent whom late in chase of beauty excellent she left pursuing that same foster strong of whose foul outrage they impatient and full of fiery zeal him followed long to rescue her from shame and to revenge her wrong through thick and thin through mountains & through plains those two great champions did atonce pursue the fearful damosel with incessant pains who from them fled as lightfoot hare from view of hunter swift and sent of hounds true at last they came unto a double way where doubtful which to take her to rescue themselves they did dispart each to assay whither more happy were to win so goodly pray but timias the princes gentle squire that ladies love unto his lord forlent and with proud envy and indignant ire after that wicked foster fiercely went so been they three three sundry ways bend but fairest fortune to the prince befell whose chance it was that soon he did repent to take that way in which that damosel was fled afore afraid of him as fiend of hell at last of her far off he gained view then gan he freshly prick his foamy steed and ever as he nigher to her drew so evermore he did increase his speed and of each turning still kept wary heed aloud to her he oftentimes did call to do away vain doubt and needless dread full mild to her he spoke and oft let fallen many meek words to stay and comfort her withal but nothing might relent her hasty flight so deep the deadly fear of that foul swain was erst impressed in her gentle spright like as a fearful dove which through the rain of the wide air her way does cut amain having far off espied a tassel gent which after her his nimble wings does strain doubles her haste for fear to be for-hent and with her pinions cleaves the liquid firmament with no less haste and eke with no less dread that fearful lady fled from him that meant to her no evil thought nor evil deed yet former fear of being foully shent carried her forward with her first intent and though oft looking backward well she viewed her self freed from that foster insolent and that it was a knight which now her sued yet she no less the knight feared then that villain rude his uncouth shield and strange arms her dismayed whose like in fairy land were seldom seen that fast she from him fled no less afraid then of wild beasts if she had chased been yet he her followed still with courage keen so long that now the golden hesperus was mounted high in top of heaven sheen and warned his other brothers joyous to light their blessed lamps in ioues eternal house all suddenly dim wox the dampish air and grisly shadows covered heaven bright that now with thousand stars was decked fair which when the prince beheld a loathful sighed and that perforce for want of longer light he mote surcease his suit and loose the hope of his long labour he gan foully wit his wicked fortune that had turned aslope and cursed night that reft from him so goodly scope tho when her ways he could no more descry but to and from at disadventure strayed like as a ship whose lodestar suddenly covered with clouds her pilot hath dismayed his wearisome pursuit perforce he stayed and from his lofty steed dismounting low did let him forage downe himself he laid upon the grassy ground to sleep a throw the cold earth was his couch the hard steel his pillow but gentle sleep envied him any rest in stead thereof sad sorrow and disdain of his hard hap did vex his noble breast and thousand fancies bet his idle brain with their light wings the sights of semblants vain oft did he wish that lady fair mote be his fairy queen for whom he did complain or that his fairy queen were such as she and ever hasty night he blamed bitterly night thou foul mother of annoyance sad sister of heavy death and nurse of woe which wast begotten in heaven but for thy bad and brutish shape thrust down to hell below where by the grim flood of cocytus slow thy dwelling is in herebus black house black herebus thy husband is the foe of all the gods where thou ungracious half of thy days dost led in horror hideous what had th'eternall maker need of thee the world in his continual course to keep that dost all things deface ne lettest see the beauty of his work indeed in sleep the slothful body that does love to steep his lustless limbs and drown his baser mind does praise thee oft and oft from stygian deep calls thee his goddess in his error blind and great dame nature's handmaid cheering every kind but well i wot that to and heavy heart thou art the root and nurse of bitter cares breeder of new renewer of old smarts in stead of rest thou lendest railing tears in stead of sleep thou sendest troublous fears and dreadful visions in the which alive the dreary image of sad death appears so from the weary spirit thou dost driven desired rest and men of happiness deprive under thy mantle black there hidden lie light-shunning theft and traitorous intent abhorred bloodshed and vile felony shameful deceit and danger imminent foul horror and eke hellish dreariment all these i wot in thy protection be and light do shun for fear of being shent for lightylike is loathed of them and thee and all that lewdness love do hate the light to see for day discovers all dishonest ways and shows each thing as it is indeed the praises of high god he fair displays and his large bounty rightly does aread days dearest children be the blessed seed which darkness shall subdue and heaven win truth is his daughter he her first did breed most sacred virgin without spot of since our life is day but death with darkness does begin o when will day then turn to me again and bring with him his long expected light o titan haste to rear thy joyous wain speed thee to spread abroad thy beams bright and chase away this too long lingering night chase her away from whence she came to hell she she it is that hath me done despite there let her with the damned spirits dwell and yield her room to day that can it govern well thus did the prince that weary night outwear in restless anguish and unquiet pain and early ere the morrow did uprear his dewy head out of the ocean main he up arose as half in great disdain and climbed unto his steed so forth he went with heavy look and lumpish pace that plain in him bewrayed great grudge and maltalent his steed eke seemed apply his steps to his intent cant. v. prince arthur hears of florimell three fosters timias wound belphebe finds him almost dead and rears out of sound wonder it is to see in diverse minds how diversely love does his pageants play and shows his pour in variable kinds the bafer wit whose idle thoughts always are wont to cleave unto the lowly clay it stirs up to sensual desire and in lewd sloth to wast his careless day but in brave sprite it kindles goodly fire that to all high desert and honour does aspire ne suffers it uncomely idleness in his free thought to built her sluggish nest ne suffers it thought of ungentleness ever to creep into his noble breast but to the highest and the worthiest lifts it up that else would lowly fallen it lets not fallen it lets it not to rest it lets not scarce this prince to breath at all but to his first pursuit him forward still does call who long time wandered through the forest wide to find some issue thence till that at last he met a dwarf that seemed terrified with some late peril which he hardly passed or other accident which him aghast of whom he asked whence he lately came and whither now he traveled so fast for soar he sweated and running through that same thick forest was be scratched & both his feet nigh lame panting for breath and almost out of heart the dwarf him answered sir ill mote i stay to tell the same i lately did depart from fairy court where i have many a day served a gentle lady of great sway and high account through out all elfin land who lately left the same and took this way her now i seek and if you understand which way she fared hath good sir tell out of hand what mister wight said he and how arrayed royally clad quoth he in cloth of gold as meetest may beseem a noble maid her fair locks in rich circlet be enrolled and fairer wight did never sun behold and on a palfrey rides more white then snow yet she her self is whiter manifold the surest sign whereby you may her know is that she is the fairest wight alive i trow now certes swain said he such one i ween fast flying through this forest from her foe a foul ill favoured foster i have seen her self well as i might i rescued though but could not stay so fast she did forego carried away with wings of speedy fear ah dearest god quoth he that is great woe and wondrous ruth to all that shall it hear but can you read sir how i may her find or where perdy me lever were to weeten that said he then ransom of the richest knight or all the good that ever yet i got but froward fortune and too forward night such happiness did maugre to me spite and from me rest both life and light atone but dwarf aread what is that lady bright that through this forest wanders thus alone for of her error strange i have great ruth and moan that lady is quoth he where so she be the bounty virgin and most debonair that ever living eye i ween did see lives none this day that may with her compare in steadfast chastity and virtue rare the goodly ornaments of beauty bright and is cleped florimell the fair fair florimell beloved of a many a knight yet she loves none but one that marinell is hight a sea-nymph's son that marinell is hight of my deer dame is loved dearly well in other none but him she sets delight all her delight is set on marinell but he sets nought at all by florimell for ladies love his mother long ago did him they say forwarn through sacred spell but fame now flies that of a foreign foe he is slain which is the ground of all our woe fiue days there be since he they say was slain and foure since florimell the court forwent and vowed never to return again till him alive or dead she did invent therefore fair sir for love of knighthood gent and honour of true ladies if you may by your good counsel or bold hardiment or succour her or me direct the way do one or other good i you most humbly pray so may you gain to you full great renown of all good ladies through the world so wide and haply in her heart find highest room of whom you seek to be most magnified at least eternal meed shall you abide to whom the prince dwarf comfort to thee take for till thou tidings learn what her betide i here avow thee never to forsake ill wears he arms that nill them use for ladies sake so with the dwarf he back returned again to seek his lady where he mote her find but by the way he greatly gan complain the want of his good squire late left behind for whom he wondrous pensive grew in mind for douht of danger which mote him betide for him he loved above all mankind having him true and faithfall ever tried and bold as ever squire that waited by knights side who all this while full hardly was assayed of deadly danger which to him betid for while his lord pursued that noble maid after that foster fowl he fiercely rid to be avenged of the shame he did to that fair damosel him he chased long through the thick woods wherein he would have hid his shameful head from his avengement strong and oft him threatened death for his outrageous wrong natheless the villain sped himself so well whither through swiftness of his speedy beast or knowledge of those woods where he did dwell that shortly he from danger was released and out of sighed escaped at the least yet not escaped from the due reward of his bad deeds which daily he increased ne ceased not till him oppressed hard the heavy plague that for such lechers is prepared for soon as he was vanished out of sighed his coward courage gan emboldened be and cast to avenge him of that fowl despite which he had born of his bold enemy tho to his brothers came for they were three ungracious children of one graceless sire and unto them complained how that he had used be of that foolhardy squire so them with bitter words he stirred to bloody ire forthwith themselves with their sad instruments of spoil and murder they gan arm belive and with him forth into the forest went to wreak the wrath which he did erst revive in their stern breasts on him which late did driven their brother to reproach and shameful flight for they had vowed that never he alive out of that forest should escape their might vile rancour their rude hearts had filled with such despite within that wood there was a covert glade foreby a narrow ford to them well known through which it was uneath for wight to wade and now by fortune it was overflown by that same way they knew that squire unknown mote algates pass for thy themselves they set there in await with thick woods over grown and all the while their malice they did whet with cruel threats his passage through the ford to let it fortuned as they devised had the gentle squire came riding that same way unweeting of their wile and treason bad and through the ford to passen did assay but that fierce foster which late fled away stoutly forth stepping on the further shore him boldly bade his passage there to stay till he had made amends and full restore for all the damage which he had him done afore with that at him a quivering dart he threw with so fell force and villainous despight that through his habergeon the forkhead flew and through the linked mails empierced quite but had no pour in his soft flesh to bite that stroke the hardy squire did soar displease but more that him he could not come to smite for by no means the high bank he could seize but laboured long in that deep ford with vain disease and still the foster with his long boar-spear him kept from landing at his wished will anon one sent out of the thicket near acruell shaft headed with deadly ill and feathered with and unlucky quill the wicked steel stayed not till it did light in his left thigh and deeply did it thrill exceeding grief that wound in him empight but more that with his foes he could not come to fight at last through wrath and vengeance making way he on the bank arrived with much pain where the third brother him did soar assay and drove at him with all his might and main a forest bill which both his hands did strain but warily he did avoid the blow and with his spear requited him again that both his sides were thrilled with the throw and a large stream of blood out of the wound did flow he tumbling down with gnashing teeth did bite the bitter earth and bade to let him in into the baleful house of endless night where wicked ghosts do wail their former since tho gan the battle freshly to begin for nathemore for that spectacle bad did th'other two their cruel vengeance blin but both atonce on both sides him bestead and load upon him laid his life for to have had tho when that villain he advised which late affrighted had the fairest florimell full of fierce fury and indignant hate to him he turned and with rigour fell smote him so rudely on the pannikell that to the chin he cleft his head in twaine down on the ground his carcase groveling fell his sinful soul with desperate disdain out of her fleshly ferme fled to the place of pain that seeing now the only last of three who with that wicked shaft him wounded had trembling with horror as that did foresee the fearful end of his avengement sad through which he follow should his brothers bad his bootless bow in feeble hand upcaught and therewith shot and arrow at the lad which faintly fluttering scarce his helmet reached and glancing fell to ground but him annoyed nought with that he would have fled into the wood but timias him lightly overhent right as he entering was into the flood and struck at him with force so violent that headless him into the ford he sent the carcase with the stream was carried down but th'head fell backward on the continent so mischieffel upon the meaner's crown they three be dead with shame the squire lives with renown he lives but takes small joy of his renown for of that cruel wound he bled so soar that from his steed he fell in deadly swown yet still the blood forth gushed in so great store that he lay wallowed all in his own gore now god thee keep thou gentlest squire alive else shall thy loving lord thee see no more but both of comfort him thou shalt deprive and eke thy self of honour which thou didst achieve providence heavenly passes living thought and does for wretched men's relief make way for lo great grace or fortune thither brought comfort to him that comfortless now lay in those same woods you well remember may how that a noble huntress did won she that base braggadochio did affray and made him fast out of the forest run belphoebe was her name as fair as phoebus sun she on a day as she pursued the chase of some wild beast which with her arrows keen she wounded had the same along did trace by tract of blood which she had freshly seen to have be sprinkled all the grassy green by the great pursue which she there perceived well hoped she the beast engored had been and made more haste the life to have bereaved but ah her expectation greatly was deceived shortly she came whereas that woeful squire with blood deformed lay in deadly swoon in whose fair eyes like lamps of quenched fire the crystal humour stood congealed round his locks like faded leaves fallen to ground knotted with blood in bunches rudely ran and his sweet lips on which before that stound the bud of youth to blossom fair began spoiled of their rosy read were waxed pale and wan saw never living eye more heavy sighed that could have made a rock of stone to rew or rive in twaine which when that lady bright beside all hope with melting eyes did view all suddenly abashed she changed hew and with stern horror backward gan to start but when she better him beheld she grew full of soft passion and unwonted smart the point of pity pierced through her tender heart meekly she bowed down to weet if life yet in his frozen members did remain and feeling by his pulses beating rife that the weak soul her seat did yet retain she cast to comfort him with busy pain his double folded neck she reared upright and rubbed his temples and each trembling vain his mailed habergeon she did undight and from his head his heavy burganet did light into the woods thenceforth in haste she went to seek for herbs that mote him remedy for she of herbs had great intendiment taught of the nymph which from her infancy her nursed had in true nobility there whither it divine tobacco were or fanachaea or polygony she found and brought it to her patient deer who all this while lay bleeding out his hart-blood near the sovereign weed betwixt two marbles plain she pounded small and did in pieces bruise and then atween her lily hands twaine into his wound the juice thereof did scruze and round about as she could well it use the flesh therewith she suppled and did steep t'abate all spasm and soak the swelling bruise and after having searched the intuse deep she with her scarf did bind the wound from cold to keep by this he had sweet life recured again and groaning inly deep at last his eyes his watery eyes drizzling like dewy rain he up gan lift towards the azure skies from whence descend all hopeless remedies therewith he sighed and turning him aside the goodly maid full of divinities and gifts of heavenly grace he by him spied her bow and gilded quiver lying him beside mercy deer lord said he what grace is this that thou hast showed to me sinful wight to send thine angel from her bower of bliss to comfort me in my distressed plighted angell or goddess do i call thee right what service may i do unto thee meet that hast from darkness me returned to light and with thy heavenly salves and medicines sweet hast dressed my sinful wounds i kiss thy blessed feet thereat she blushing said ah gentle squire nor goddess i nor angel but the maid and daughter of a woody nymph desire no service but thy safety and aid which if thou gain i shall well payed we mortal wights whose lives and fortune's be to common accidents still open laid are bound with common bound of frailty to succour wretched wights whom we captived see by this her damsels which the former chase had undertaken after her arrived as did belphoebe in the bloody place and thereby deemed the beast had be deprived of life whom late their ladies arrow rived for thy the bloody tract they follow fast and every one to run the swiftest strived but two of them the rest far overpassed and where their lady was arrived at the last where when they saw that goodly boy with blood defouled and their lady dress his wound they wondered much and shortly understood how him in deadly case their lady found and rescued out of the heavy stound eftsoones his warlike courser which was strayed far in the woods while that he lay in swoon she made those damsels search which being stayed they did him set thereon and forthwith them conveyed into that forest far they thence him led where was their dwelling in a pleasant glade with mountains round about environed and mighty woods which did the valley shade and like a stately theatre it made spreading it self into a spacious plain and in the midst a little river played amongst the pumy stones which seemed to plain with gentle murmur that his course they did restrain beside the same a dainty place there lay planted with myrtle trees and laurels green in which the birds song many a lovely lay of gods high praise and of their loves sweet teen as it and earthly paradise had been in whose enclosed shadow there was pight a fair pavilion scarcely to be seen the which was all within most richly dight that greatest princes living it mote well delight thither they brought that wounded squire and laid in easy couch his feeble limbs to rest he rested him a while and then the maid his ready wound with better salves new dressed daily she dressed him and did the best his grievous hurt to garish that she might that shortly she his dolour hath redressed and his foul soar reduced to fair plighted it she reduced but himself destroyed quite o foolish physic and unfruitful pain that heals up one and makes another wound she his hurt thigh to him recured again but hurt his heart the which before was found through and unwary dart which did rebound from her fair eyes and gracious countenance what boots it him from death to be unbound to be captived in endless durance of sorrow and despair without allegiance still as his wound did gather and grow hold so still his heart wox soar and health decayed madness to save a part and loose the whole still whenas he beheld the heavenly maid while daily plasters to his wound she laid so still his malady the more increased the while her matchless beauty him dismayed ah god what other could he do at least but love so fair a lady that his life released long while he strove in his courageous breast with reason due the passion to subdue and love for to dislodge out of his nest still when her excellencies he did view her sovereign bounty and celestial hew the same to love he strongly was constrained but when his mean estate he did renew he from such hardy boldness was restrained and of his luckless lot and cruel love thus plained unthankful wretch said he is this the meed with which her sovereign mercy thou dost quite thy life she saved by her gracious deed but thou dost ween with villainous despite to blot her honour and her heavenly light die rather die then so disloyally deem of her high desert or seem so light fair death it is to shun more shame to die die rather die then ever love disloyally but if to love disloyalty it be shall i then hate her that from deaths door me brought ah far be such reproach from me what can i less do then her love therefore sith i her due reward cannot restore die rather die and dying do her serve dying her serve and living her adore thy life she gave thy life she does deserve die rather die then ever from her service swerve but foolish boy what boots thy service base to her to whom the heavens do serve and sew thou a mean squire of meek and lowly place she heavenly born and of celestial hew how then of all love takes equal view and does not highest god vouchsafe to take the love and service of the basest crew if she will not die meekly for her sake die rather die then ever so fair love forsake thus warrayed he long time against his will till that through weakness he was forced at last to yield himself unto the mighty ill which as a victor proud gan ransack fast his inward parts and all his entrails wast that neither blood in face nor life in heart it left but both did quite dry up and blast as piercing levin which the inner part of every thing consumes and calcines by art which seeing fair belphoebe gan to fear lest that his wound were inly well not healed or that the wicked steel empoisoned were little she weened that love he close concealed yet still he wasted as the snow congealed when the bright sun his beams thereon does beatrice yet never he his heart to her revealed but rather chosen to die for sorrow great then with dishonourable terms her to entreat she gracious lady yet no pains did spare to do him ease or do him remedy many restoratives of virtues rare and costly cordials she did apply to mitigate his stubborn malady but that sweet cordial which can restore a lovesick heart she did to him envy to him and to all th'vnworthy world forlore she did envy that sovereign salve in secret store that dainty rose the daughter of her morn more deer then life she tendered whose flower the garland of her honour did adorn ne suffered she the middays scorching pour ne the sharp northern wind thereon to shower but lapped up her silken leaves most chair when so the froward sky began to lower but soon as calmed was the crystal air she did it fair dispread and let to flourish fair eternal god in his almighty pour to make ensample of his heavenly grace in paradise whilom did plant this flower whence he it fetched out of her native place and did in stock of earthly flesh enrace that mortal men her glory should admire in gentle ladies breast and bounteous raze of woman kind it fairest flower does spire and bears fruit of honour and all chaste desire fair imps of beauty whose bright shining beams adorn the world with like to heavenly light and to your wills both royalties and realms subdue through conquest of your wondrous might with this fair flower your goodly girlands dight of chastity and virtue virginal that shall embellish more your beauty bright and crown your heads with heavenly coronal such as the angels wear before gods tribunal to your fair selves a fair ensample frame of this fair virgin this belphoebe fair to whom in perfect love and spotless fame of chastity none living may compare ne poisonous envy justly can impair the praise of her fresh flowering maidenhead for thy she stands on the highest stair of honourable stage of womanhead that ladies all may follow her ensample dead in so great praise of steadfast chastity natheless she was so courteous and kind tempered with grace and goodly modesty that seemed those two virtues strove to find the higher place in her heroic mind so striving each did other more augment and both increased the praise of woman kind and both increased her beauty excellent so all did make in her a perfect compliment cant. vi the birth of fair belphoebe and of amoret is told the gardens of adonis fraught with pleasures manifold well may i ween fair ladies all this while you wonder how this noble damosel so great perfections did in her compile sith that in salvage forests she did dwell so far from court and royal citadel the great schoolmistress of all courtesy seems that such wild woods should far expel all civil usage and gentility and gentle sprite deform with rude rusticity but to this fair belphoebe in her berth the heavens so favourable were and free looking with mild aspect upon the earth in th'horoscope of her nativity that all the gifts of grace and chastity on her they poured forth of plenteous horn ioue laughed on venus from his sovereign see and phoebus with fair beams did her adorn and all the graces rocked her cradle being born her berth was of the womb of morning due and her conception of the joyous prime and all her whole creation did her show pure and unspotted from all loathly crime that is ingenerate in fleshly slime so was this virgin born so was she bred so was she trained up from time to time in all chaste virtue and true bountihood till to her due perfection she was ripened her mother was the fair chrysogonee the daughter of amphisa who by raze a faery was born of high degree she boar belphaebe she boar in like case fair amoretta in the second place these two were twins & betwixt them two did share the heritage of all celestial grace that all the rest it seemed they robbed bore of bounty and of beauty and all virtues rare it were a goodly story to declare by what strange accident fair chrysogone conceived these infants and how them she bore in this wild forest wandering all alone after she had nine months fulfilled and gone for not as other women's commune brood they were enwombed in the sacred throne of her chaste body nor with commune food as other women's babes they sucked vital blood but wondrously they were begotten and bred through influence of heavens fruitful ray as it in antique books is mentioned it was upon a some shiny day when titan fair his beams did display in a fresh fountain far from all men's view she bathed her breast the boiling heat t'allay she bathed with roses read and violets blew and all the sweetest flowers that in the forest grew till faint through irksome weariness adown upon the grassy ground her self she laid to sleep the while a gentle slumbering swown upon her fell all naked bore displayed the sunbeams bright upon her body played being through former bathing mollified and pierced into her womb where they embayed with so sweet sense and secret power unspied that in her pregnant flesh they shortly fructified miraculous may seem to him that reads so strange ensample of conception but reason teaches that the fruitful seeds of all things living through impression of the sunbeams in moist complexion do life conceive and quickened are by kind so after nilus inundation infinite shapes of creature men do find informed in the mud on which the sun hath shined great father he of generation is rightly called author of life and light and his fair sister for creation ministereth matter fit which tempered right with heat and humour breeds the living wight so sprung these twins in womb of chrysogone yet wist she nought thereof but soar affright wondered to see her belly so upblown which still increased till she her term had full outgone whereof conceiving shame and foul disgrace albe her guiltless conscience her cleared she sled into the wilderness a space till that unwieldy burden she had reared and shunned dishonour which as death she feared where weary of long travel down to rest her self she set and comfortably cheered there a sad cloud of sleep her overcast and seized every sense with sorrow soar oppressed it fortuned fair venus having lost her little son the winged god of love who for some light displeasure which him crossed was from her fled as flit as airy dove and left her blissful bower of joy above so from her often he had fled away when she for ought him sharply did reprove and wandered in the world in strange array disguised in thousand shapes that none might him bewray him for to seek she left her heavenly house the house of goodly forms and fair aspects whence all the world derives the glorious features of beauty's and all shapes select with which high god his workmanship hath decked and searched every way through which his wings had born him or his tract she mote detect she promised kisses sweet and sweeter things unto the man that of him tidings to her brings first she him sought in court where most he used whilom to haunt but there she found him not but many there she found which soar accused his falsehood and with foul infamous blot his cruel deeds and wicked wiles did spot ladies and lords she every where mote hear complaining how with his empoisoned shot their woeful hearts he wounded had whilere and so had left them languishing betwixt hope and fear she then the cities sought from gate to gate and every one did ask did he him see and every one her answered that too late he had him seen and felt the cruelty of his sharp darts and hot artillery and every one threw forth reproaches rife of his mischievous deeds and said that he was the disturber of all civil life the enemy of peace and author of all strife then in the country she abroad him sought and in the rural cottages inquired where also many plaints to her were brought how he their heedless hearts with love had fired and his false venom through their veins inspired and eke the gentle shepherd swains which sat keeping their fleecy flocks as they were hired she sweetly herd complain both how and what her son had to them done yet she did smile thereat but when in none of all these she him god she gan avise where else he mote him hide at last she her bethought that she had not yet sought the salvage woods and forests wide in which full many lovely nymphs abide amongst whom might be that he did closely lie or that the love of some of them him tied for thy she thither cast her course apply to search the secret haunts of dianes company shortly unto the wasteful woods she came whereas she found the goddess with her crew after late chase of their imbrued game sitting beside a fountain in a rew some of them washing with the liquid due from off their dainty limbs the dusty sweat and soil which did deform their lively hew others lay shaded from the scorching heat the rest upon her person gave attendance great she having hung upon a bough on high her bow and painted quiver had unlaced her silver buskin's from her nimble thigh and her lank loins ungirded and breasts unbraced after her heat the breathing cold to taste her golden locks that late in tresses bright embraided were for hindering of her haste now lose about her shoulders hung undight and were with sweet ambrosia all be sprinkled light soon as she venus saw behind her back she was ashamed to be so lose surprised and wox half wroth against her damsels flack that had neither thereof before advised but suffered her so carelessly disguised be overtaken soon her garments lose upblowing in her bosom she comprised well as she might and to the goddess rose while all her nymphs did like a garland her enclose goodly she gan fair cytherea greet and shortly asked her what cause her brought into that wilderness for her unmeet from her sweet bowers and beds with pleasures fraught that sudden change she strange adventure thought to whom half weeping she thus answered that she her dearest son cupido sought who in his frowardness from her was fled that she repented soar to have him angered thereat diana gan to smile in scorn of her vain plaint and to her scoffing said great pity sure that you be so forlorn of your gay son that gives you so good aid to your disports ill mote you be payed but she was more engrieved and replied fair sister ill beseems it to upbraid a doleful heart with so disdainful pride the like that mine may be your pain another tide as you in woods and wanton wilderness your glory set to chase the salvage beasts so my delight is all in joyfulness in beds in bowers in banquets and in feasts and ill becomes you with your lofty crests to scorn the joy that ioue is glad to seek we both are bound to follow heavens behests and tend our charges with obeisance meek spare gentle sister with reproach my pain to eke and tell me if that you my son have herd to lurk amongst your nymphs in secret wise or keep their cabins much i am afeard lest he like one of them him self disguise and turn his arrows to their exercise so may he long himself full easy hide for he is fair and fresh in face and guise as any nymph let not it be envied so saying every nymph full narrowly she eyed but phoebe therewith soar was angered and sharply said go dame go seek your boy where you him lately left in mars his bed he comes not here we scorn his foolish joy ne lend we leisure to his idle toy but if i catch him in this company by stygian lake i vow whose sad annoy the gods do dread he dearly shall aby i'll clip his wanton wings that he no more shall fly whom when as venus saw so soar displeased she inly sorry was and gan relent what she had said so her she soon appeased with sugared words and gentle blandishment from which a fountain from her sweet lips went and welled goodly forth that in short space she was well pleased and forth her damsels sent through all the woods to search from place to place if any tract of him or tidings they mote trace to search the god of love her nymphs she sent throughout the wandering forest every where and after them her self eke with her went to seek the fugitive both far and never so long they sought till they arrived were in that same shady covert whereas lay fair crysogone in slumbery trance whilere who in her sleep a wondrous thing to say unwares had born two babes as fair as springing day unwares she them conceived unwares she boar she boar withouten pain that she conceived withouten pleasure ne her need implore lucinaes aid which when they both perceived they were through wonder nigh of sense bereaved and gazing each on other nought bespoke at last they both agreed her seeming grieved out of her heavy swown not to awake but from her loving side the tender babes to take up they them took each one a babe uptook and with them carried to be fostered dame phoebe to a nymph her babe betook to be upbrought in perfect maidenhead and of her self her name belphoebe read but venus hers hence far away conveyed to be upbrought in goodly womanhood and in her little loves stead which was strayed her amoretta called to comfort her dismayed she brought her to her joyous paradise where most she wones when she on earth does dwell so fair a place as nature can devise whither in paphos or cytheron hill or it in gnidus be i wot not well but well i wot by trial that this same all other pleasant places does excel and called is by her lost lovers name the garden of adonis far renowned by fame in that same garden all the goodly flowers wherewith dame nature does her beautify and decks the girlands of her paramours are fetched there is the first seminary of all things that are born to live and die according to their kinds long work it were here to account the endless pregenie of all the weeds that bud and blossom there but so much as does need must needs be counted here it sited was in fruitful soil of old and girded in with two walls on either side the one of iron the other of bright gold that none might thorough break nor overstride and double gates it had which opened wide by which both in and out men moten pass th'one fair and fresh the other old and dried old genius the porter of them was old genius the which a double nature has he lets in he lets out to weened all that to come into the world desire a thousand thousand naked babes attend about him day and night which do require that he with fleshly weeds would them attire such as him list such as eternal fate ordained hath he clothes with sinful mire and sends forth to live in mortal state till they again return back by the hinder gate after that they again returned been they in that garden planted be again and grow a fresh as they had never seen fleshly corruption nor mortal pain some thousand years so done they there remaire and then of him are clad with other hew or sent into the changeful world again till thither they return where first they grew so like a wheel around they run from old to new ne needs there gardener to set or sow to plant of prune for of their own accord all things as they created were do grow and yet remember well the mighty word which first was spoken by almighty lord that bade them to increase and multiply ne do they need with water of the ford or of the clouds to moisten their roots dry for in themselves eternal moisture they imply infinite shapes of creatures there are bred and uncouth forms which none yet ever knew and every sort is in a sundry bed set by itself and ranked in comely rew some fit for reasonable souls indew some made for beasts some made for birds to wear and all the fruitful spawn of fish hew in endless ranks along enranged were that seemed the ocean could not contain them there daily they grow and daily forth are sent into the world it to replenish more yet is the stock not lessened nor spent but still remains in everlasting store as it at first created was of yore for in the wide womb of the world there lies in hateful darkness and in deep horror and huge eternal chaos which supplies the substances of nature's fruitful progenies all things from thence do their first being fetch and borrow matter whereof they are made which when as form and feature it does catch becomes a body and does then invade the state of life out of the griefly shade that substance is eterne and bids so ne when the life decays and form does fade does it consume and into nothing go but changed is and often altered to and from the subtance is not changed nor altered but only form and outward fashion for every substance is conditioned to change her hew and sundry forms to done meet for her temper and complexion for forms are variable and decay by course of kind and by occasion and that fair flower of beauty fades away as does the lily fresh before the sunny ray great enemy to it and to all the rest that in the garden of adonis springs is wicked time who with his scythe addressed does mow the flowering herbs and goodly things and all their glory to the ground down flings where they do wither and are foully marred he flies about and with his flaggy wings beats down both leaves and buds without regard ne ever pity may relent his malice hard yet pity often did the gods relent to see so fair things marred and spoiled quite and their great mother venus did lament the loss of her deer brood her deer delight her heart was pierced with pity at the sighed when walking through the garden them she spied yet no'te she find redress for such despite for all that lives is subject to that law all things decay in time and to their end do draw but were it not that time their troubler is all that in this delightful garden grows should happy be and have immortal bliss for here all plenty and all pleasure flows and sweet love gentle fits amongst them throws without fell rancour or found jealousy frankly each paramour his leman knows each bird his mate ne any does envy their goodly merriment and gay felicity there is continual spring and harvest there continual both meeting at one time for both the boughs do laughing blossoms bear and with fresh colours deck the wanton prime and eke atonce the heavy trees they climb which seem to labour under their fruits load the while the joyous birds make their pastime amongst the shady leaves their sweet abided and their true loves without suspicion tell abroad right in the midst of that paradise there stood a stately mount on whose round top a gloomy grove of myrtle trees did rise whose shady boughs sharp steel did never lop nor wicked beasts their tender buds did crop but like a garland compassed the hight and from their fruitful sides sweet gum did drop that all the ground with precious dew bedight threw forth most dainty odours & most sweet delight and in the thickest covert of that shade there was a pleasant arbour not by art but of the trees own inclination made which knitting their rank branches part to part with wanton ivy twine entrailed athwart and eglantine and caprifole among fashioned above within their inmost part that neither phoebus beams could through them throng nor aeolus sharp blast could work them any wrong and all about grew every sort of flower to which sad lovers were transformed of yore fresh hyacinthus phoebus paramour foolish narcisse that likes the watery shore sad amaranthus made a slowre but late sad amaranthus in whose purple gore me seems i see amintas wretched fate to whom sweet poets verse hath given endless date there wont fair venus often to enjoy her deer adonis joyous company and reap sweet pleasure of the wanton boy there yet some say in secret he does lie lapped in flowers and precious spicery by her hid from the world and from the skill of stygian gods which do her love envy but she her self when ever that she will possesses him and of his sweetness takes her fill and sooth it seems they say for he may not for ever die and ever buried be in baleful night where all things are forgotten all be he subject to mortality yet is eterne in mutability and by succession made perpetual transformed oft and changed diversely for him the father of all forms they call therefore needs mote he live that living gives to all there now he lives in eternal bliss joying his goddess and of her enjoyed ne fears he henceforth that foe of his which with his cruel tusk him deadly cloyed for that wild boar the which him once annoyed she firmly hath imprisoned for ay that her sweet love his malice mote avoid in a strong rocky cave which is they say hewn underneath that mount that none him losen may there now he lives in everlasting joy with many of the gods in company which thither haunt and with the winged boy sporting himself in safe felicity who when he hath with spoils and cruelty ransacked the world and in the woeful hearts of many wretches set his triumphs high thither resorts and laying his sad darts aside with fair adonis plays his wanton parts and his true love fair psyche with him plays fair psyche to him lately reconciled after long troubles and unmeet upbraids with which his mother venus her reviled and eke himself her cruelly exiled but now in steadfast love and happy state she with him lives and hath him born a child pleasure that does both gods and men aggrate pleasure the daughter of cupid and psyche late hither great venus brought this infant fair the younger daughter of chrysogonee and unto psyche with great trust and care committed her fostered to be and trained up in true feminity who no less carefully her tendered then her own daughter pleasure to whom she made her companion and her lessoned in all the lore of love and goodly womanhead in which when she to perfect ripeness grew of grace and beauty noble paragon she brought her forth into the world's view to be ensample of true love alone and lodestar of all chaste affection to all fair ladies that do live on ground to fairy court she came where many one admired her goodly haviour and found his feeble heart wide launched with loves cruel wound but she to none of them her love did cast save to the noble knight sir scudamore to whom her loving heart she linked fast in fathfull love abide for evermore and for his dearest sake endured soar soar trouble of and heinous enemy who her would forced have to have forlore her former love and steadfast loyalty as you may elsewhere read that rueful history but well i ween you first desire to learn what end unto that fearful damosel which fled so fast from that same foster stern whom with his brothers timias slew befell that was to weet the goodly florimell who wandering for to seek her lover deer her lover deer her dearest marinell into misfortune fell as you did hear and from prince arthur fled with wings of idle fear cant. vii the witches son loves florimell she flies he feigns to die satyrane saves the squire of dams from giants tyranny like as and hind forth singled from the herd that hath escaped from a ravenous beast yet flies away of her own feet afeard and every leaf that shakes with the least murmur of wind her terror hath increased so fled fair florimell from her vain fear long after she from peril was released each shade she saw and each noise she did hear did seem to be the same which she escaped whilere all that same evening she in flying spent and all that night her course continued ne did she let dull sleep once to relent nor weariness to slack her haste but fled ever alike as if her former dreaded were hard behind her ready to arrest and her white palfrey having conquered the mastering reins out of her weary wrest perforce her carried where ever he thought best so long as breath and able puissance did native courage unto him supply his pace he freshly forward did advance and carried her beyond all jeopardy but nought that wants rest can long aby he having through incessant travel spent his force at last perforce a down did lie ne foot could further move the lady gent thereat was sudden struck with great astonishment and forced t'alight on foot mote algates fare a traveller unwonted to such way need teaches her this lesson hard and rare that fortune all in equal lance does sway and mortal misery's does make her play so long she traveled till at length she came to and hills side which did to her bewray a little valley subject to the same all covered with thick woods that quite it overcame through the tops of the high trees she did descry a little smoke whose vapour thin and light reeking aloft uprolled to the sky which cheerful sign did send unto her sighed that in the same did won some living wight eftsoon her steps she thereunto applied and came at last in weary wretched plighted unto the place to which her hope did guide to find some refuge there and rest her weary side there in a gloomy hollow glen she found a little cottage built of sticks and redes in homely wise and walled with sods around in which a witch did dwell in loathly weeds and wilful want all careless of her needs so choosing solitary to abide far from all neighbours that her devilish deeds and hellish arts from people she might hide and hurt far off unknown whom ever she envied the damosel there arriving entered in where sitting on the flore the hag she found busy as seemed about some wicked gin who soon as she beheld that sud in stound lightly upstarted from the dusty ground and with fell look and hollow deadly gaze stared on her awhile as one astounded ne had one word to speak for great amaze but showed by outward signs that dread her sense did daze at last turning her fear to foolish wrath she asked what devil had her thither brought and who she was and what unwonted path had guided her unwelcomed unsought to which the damosel full of doubtful thought her mildly answered beldame be not wroth with silly virgin by adventure brought unto your dwelling ignorant and loath that crave but room to rest while tempest overblows with that adown out of her crystal eyes few trickling tears she softly forth let fallen that like two orient pearls did purely shine upon her snowy cheek and therewithal she sighed soft that none so bestial nor salvage heart but ruth of her sad plighted would make to melt or piteously appall and that vile hag all were her whole delight in mischief was much moved at so piteous sighed and gan recomfort her in her rude wise with womanish compassion of her plaint wiping the tears from her suffused eyes and bidding her fit down to rest her faint and weary limbs a while she nothing quaint nor sdainful of so homely fashion sith brought she was now to so hard constraint sat down upon the dusty ground anon as glad of that small rest as bird of tempest gone tho gan she gather up her garments rend and her lose locks to dight in order due with golden wreathe and gorgeous ornament whom such whenas the wicked hag did view she was astonished at her heavenly hew and doubted her to deem and earthly wight but or some goddess or of dianes crew and thought her to adore with humble spright t'adore thing so divine as beauty were but right this wicked woman had a wicked son the comfort of her age and weary days a lazy lord for nothing good to done but stretched forth in idleness always ne ever cast his mind to covet praise or ply him self to any honest trade but all the day before the sunny rays he used to slug or sleep in slothful shade such laziness both lewd and poor atonce him made he coming home at undertime there found the fairest creature that he ever saw sitting beside his mother on the ground the sighed whereof did greatly him adaw and his base thought with terror and with awe so inly smote that as one which had gazed on the bright sun unwares does soon withdraw his feeble eyes with too much brightness dazed so stared he on her and stood long while amazed softly at last he gan his mother ask what mister wight that was and whence derived that in so strange disguisement there did mask and by what accident she there arrived but she as one nigh of her wits deprived with nought but ghastly looks him answered like to a ghost that lately is revived from stygian shores where late it wandered so both at her and each at other wondered but the fair virgin was so meek and mild that she to them vouchsafed to embase her goodly port and to their senses vild her gentle speech applied that in short space she grew familiar in that desert place during which time the churl through her so kind and courteous use conceived affection base and cast to love her in his brutish mind no love but brutish lust that was so beastly tind closely the wicked flame his bowels brent and shortly grew into outrageous fire yet had he not the heart nor hardiment as unto her to utter his desire his caitiff thought durst not so high aspire but with soft sighs and lovely semblances he weened that his affection entire she should aread many resemblances to her he made and many kind remembrances oft from the forest wildings he did bring whose sides empurpled were with smiling read and oft young birds which he had taught to sing his mistress praises sweetly caroled girlands of flowers sometime for her fair head he fine would dight sometime the squirrel wild he brought to her in bans as conquered to be her thrall his fellow servant vild all which she of him took with countenance meek and mild but past awhile when she fit season saw to leave that desert mansion she cast in secret wise her self thence to withdraw for fear of mischief which she did forecast might be the witch or that her son compassed her weary palfrey closely as she might now well recovered after long repast in his proud furnitures she freshly dight his late miswandered ways now to remeasure right and early ere the dawning day appeared she forth issued and on her journey went she went in peril of each noise afeard and of each shade that did it self present for still she feared to be overhent of that vile hag or her uncivil son who when too late awaking well they kenned that their fair guest was gone they both begun to make exceeding moan as they had be undone but that lewd lover did the most lament for her depart that ever man did hear he knocked his breast with desperate intent and scratched his face and with his teeth did tear his rugged flesh and rend his ragged hear that his sad mother seeing his soar plighted was greatly woe begun and gan to fear lest his frail senses were emperished quite and love to frenzy turned sith love is frantic hight all ways she sought him to restore to plighted with herbs with charms with counsel & with tears but tears nor charms nor herbs nor counsel might assuage the fury which his entrails tears so strong is passion that no reason hears tho when all other helps she saw to fail she turned her self back to her wicked leers and by her devilish arts thought to prevail to bring her back again or work her final bale eftsoones out of her hidden cave she called and hideous beast of horrible aspect that could the stoutest courage have paid monstrous mishapped and all his back was specked with thousand spots of colours quaint elect thereto so swift that it all beasts did pass like never yet did living eye detect but likest it to and hyena was that feeds on women's flesh as others feed on grass it forth she called and gave it straight in charge through thick and thin her to pursue apace ne once to stay to rest or breath at large till her he had attained and brought in place or quite devoured her beauty's scornful grace the monster swift as word that from her went went forth in haste and did her footing trace so sure and swiftly through his perfect sent and passing speed that shortly he her overhent whom when the fearful damosel nigh espied no need to bid her fast away to fly that ugly shape so soar her terrified that it she shunned no less then dread to die and her flit palfrey did so well apply his nimble feet to her conceived fear that whilst his breath did strength to him supply from peril free he her away did bear but when his force gan fail his pace gan wex arear which whenas she perceived she was dismayed at that same last extremity full soar and of her safety greatly grew afraid and now she gan approach to the sea shore as it befell that she could fly no more but yield her self to spoil of greediness lightly she leapt as a wight forlore from her dull horse in desperate distress and to her feet betook her doubtful sickerness not half so fast the wicked myrrha fled from dread of her revenging father's hound nor half so fast to save her maidenhead fled fearful daphne on th'aegaean strand as florimell fled from that monster yond to reach the sea ere she of him were reached for in the sea to drown her self she found rather then of the tyrant to be caught thereto fear gave her wings and need her courage taught it fortuned high god did so ordain as she arrived on the roaring shore in mind to leap into the mighty main a little boat lay hoving her before in which there slept a fisher old and poor the while his nets were drying on the sand into the same she leapt and with the over did thrust the shallop from the floating strand so safety found at sea which she found not at land the monster ready on the prey to seize was of his forward hope deceived quite ne durst assay to wade the perilous seas but greedily long gaping at the sighed at last in vain was forced to turn his flight and tell the idle tidings to his dame yet to avenge his devilish despite he set upon her palfrey tired lame and slew him cruelly ere any rescue came and after having him emboweled to fill his bellish gorge it chanced a knight to pass that way as forth he traveled it was a goodly swain and of great might as ever man that bloody field did fight but in vain shows that wont young knights bewitch and courtly services took no delight but rather joyed to be then seem fich for both to be and seem to him was labour lich it was to weet the good sir satyrane that ranged abroad to seek adventures wild as was his wont in forest and in plain he was all armed in rugged steel unfilled as in the smoky forge it was compiled and in his scutcheon boar a satires head he coming present where the monster vild upon that milkwhite palfreys carcase fed unto his rescue ran and greedily him sped there well perceived he that it was the horse whereon fair florimell was wont to ride that of that fiend was rend without remorse much feared he lest ought did ill betide to that fair maid the flower of women's pride for her he dearly loved and in all his famous conquests highly magnified beside her golden girdle which did fallen from her in flight he found that did him soar appall full of sad fear and doubtful agony fiercely he flew upon that wicked fiend and with huge strokes and cruel battery him forced to leave his prey for to attend him self from deadly danger to defend full many wounds in his corrupted flesh he did engrave and mush blood did spend yet might not do him die but aye more fresh and fierce he still appeared the more he did him thresh he wist not how him to despoil of life ne how to win the wished victory sith him he saw still stronger grow through strife and him self weaker through infirmity greatly he grew enraged and furiously hurling his sword away he lightly leapt upon the beast that with great cruelty roared and raged to be underkept yet he perforce him held and strokes upon him heaped as he that strives to stop a sudden flood and in strong banks his violence enclose forceth it swell above his wonted mood and largely overflow the fruitful plain that all the country seems to be a main and the rich furrows float all quite fordone the woeful husbandman does loud complain to see his whole years labour lost so soon for which to god he made so many and idle boon so him he held and did through might amate so long he held him and him bet so long that at the last his fierceness gan abate and meekly stoup unto the victor strong who to avenge the implacable wrong which he supposed done to florimell sought by all means his dolour to prolong sith dint of steel his carcase could not quell his maker with her charms had framed him so well the golden ribbon which that virgin wore about her slender waste he took in hand and with it bound the beast that loud did roar for great despite of that unwonted band yet dared not his victor to withstand but trembled like a lamb fled from the prey and all the way him followed on the strand as he had long be learned to obey yet never learned he such service till that day thus as he led the beast along the way he spied far off a mighty giauntesle fast flying on a courser dappled grey from a bold knight that with great hardiness her hard pursued and sought for to suppress she boar before her lap a doleful squire lying athwart her horse in great distress fast bounden hand and foot with cords of wire whom she did mean to make the thrall of her desire which whenas satyrane beheld in haste he left his captive beast at liberty and crossed the nearest way by which he cast her to encounter ere she passed by but she the way shunned nathemore for thy but forward galloped fast which when he spied his mighty spear he couched warily and at her ran she having him descried her self to fight addressed and threw her load aside like as a goshawk that in foot does bear a trembling culver having spied on hight and eagle that with plumy wings does shear the subtle air stooping with all his might the quarry throws to ground with fell despite and to the battle does her self prepare so ran the giantess unto the fight her firy eyes with furious sparks did stare and with blasphemous banns high god in pieces tear she caught in hand and huge great iron mace wherewith she many had of life deprived but ere the stroke could seize his aimed place his spear amids her sunbroad shield arrived yet nathemore the steel a sunder rived all were the beam in bigness like a mast ne her out of the steadfast saddle drived but glancing on the tempered mettle braced in thousand shivers and so forth beside her past her steed did stagger with that puissant struck but she no more was moved with that might then it had lighted on and aged oak or on the marble pillar that is pight upon the top of mount olympus hight for the brave youthly champions to assay with burning chariot wheels it nigh to smite but who that smites it mars his joyous play and is the spectacle of ruinous decay yet there with soar enraged with stern regard her dreadful weapon she to him addressed which on his helmet marteled so hard that made him low incline his lofty crest and bowed his battered visor to his breast wherewith he was so stunned that he no'te ride but reeled to and from from east to west which when his cruel enemy espied she lightly unto him adjoined side to side and on his collar laying puissant hand out of his wavering seat him plucked perforce perforce him plucked unable to withstand or help himself and laying thwart her horse in loathly wise like to a carrion corpse she boar him fast away which when the knight that her pursued saw with great remorse he near was touched in his noble spright and gan increase his speed as she increased her flight whom when as nigh approaching she espied she threw away her burden angrily for she list not the battle to abide but made her self more light away to fly yet her the hardy knight pursued so nigh that almost in the back he oft her strake but still when him at hand she did espy she turned and semblance of fair fight did make but when he stayed to flight again she did her take by this good sir satyrane gan wake out of his dream that did him long entrance and seeing none in place he gan to make exceeding moan and cursed that cruel chance which reft from him so fair a chevisance at length he spied whereas that woeful squire whom he had rescued from captivance of his strong foe lay tumbled in the mire unable to arise or foot or hand to stir to whom approaching well he mote perceive in that foul plighted a comely personage and lovely face made fit for to deceive frail ladies heart with loves consuming rage now in the blossom of his freshest age he reared him up and loosed his iron bans and after gan inquire his parentage and how he fell into that giants hands and who that was which chased her along the lands then trembling yet through fear the squire bespoke that giantess argante is behight a daughter of the titans which did make war against heaven and heaped hills on hight to scale the skies and put ioue from his right her sire typhaeus was who mad through mirth and drunk with blood of men slain by his might through incest her of his own mother earth whilom begotten being but half twin of that berth for at that berth another babe she boar to weet the mighty ollyphant that wrought great wreak to many errant knights of yore and many hath to foul confusion brought these twins men say a thing far passing thought while in their mother's womb enclosed they were ere they into the lightsome world were brought in fleshly lust were mingled both yfere and in that monstrous wise did to the world appear so lived they ever after in like since gainst nature's law and good behaviour but greatest shame was to that maiden twin who not content so foully to devour her native flesh and strain her brother's bower did wallow in all other fleshly mire and suffered beasts her body to deflower so hot she burned in that lustful fire yet all that might not slake her sensual desire but over all the country she did range to seek young men to quench her flaming thirst and feed her fancy with delightful change whom so she fittest finds to serve her lust through her main strength in which she most does trust she with her brings into a secret i'll where in eternal bondage die he must or be the vassal of her pleasures vile and in all shameful sort him self with her defile me silly wretch she so at vantage caught after she long in wait for me did lie and meant unto her prison to have brought her loathsome pleasure there to satisfy that thousand deaths me lever were to die then break the vow that to fair columbell i plighted have and yet keep steadfastly as for my name it misters not to tell call me the squire of dams that me beseems well but that bold knight whom you pursuing saw that giantess is not such as she seemed but a fair virgin that in martial law and deeds of arms above all dams is deemed and above many knights is eke esteemed for her great worth she palladine is hight she you from death you me from dread redeemed ne any may that monster match in fight but she or such as she that is so chaste a wight her well beseems that quest quoth satyrane but read thou squire of dams what vow is this which thou upon thy self hast lately taken that shall i you recount quoth he ywis so be you pleased to pardon all amiss that gentle lady whom i love and serve after long suit and weary services did ask me how i could her love deserve and how she might be sure that i would never swerve i glad by any means her grace to gain bade her command my life to save or spill eftsoones she bade me with incessant pain to wander through the world abroad at will and every where where with my power or skill i might do service unto gentle dams that i the same should faithfully fulfil and at the twelue months end should bring their names and pledges as the spoils of my victorious games so well i to fair ladies service did and found such favour in their loving hearts that ere the year his course had compassed three hundred pledges for my good deserts and thirse three hundred thanks for my good parts i with me brought and did to her present which when she saw more bent to eke my smarts then to reward my trusty true intent she gan for me devise a grievous punishment to weet that i my travel should resume and with like labour walk the world around ne ever to her presence should presume till i so many other dams had found the which for all the suit i could propound would me refuse their pledges to afford but did abide for ever chaste and found ah gentle squire quoth he tell at one word how many foundest thou such to put in thy record in deed sir knight said he one word may tell all that i ever found so wisely stayed for only three they were disposed so well and yet three years i now abroad have strayed to find them out mote i then laughing said the knight inquire of thee what were those three the which thy proffered courtesy denied or ill they seemed sure advised to be or brutishly brought up that never did fashions see the first which then refused me said he certes was but a common courtesan yet flat refused to have a doe with me because i could not give her many a iane. thereat full heartily laughed satyrane the second was and holy nun to chosen which would not let me be her chaplain because she knew she said i would disclose her counsel if she should her trust in me repose the third a damosel was of low degree whom i in country cottage found by chance full little weened i that chastity had lodging in so mean a maintenance yet was she fair and in her countenance dwelled simple truth in seemly fashion long thus i wooed her with due observance in hope unto my pleasure to have wone but was as far at last as when i first begun safe her i never any woman found that chastity did for it self embrace but were for other causes firm and found either for want of handsome time and place or else for fear of shame and fowl disgrace thus am i hopeless ever to attain my ladies love in such a desperate case but all my days am like to wast in vain seeking to match the chaste with unchaste ladies train perdy said satyrane thou squire of dams great labour fondly hast thou hent in hand to get small thanks and therewith many blames that may amongst alcides labours stand thence back returning to the former land where late he left the beast he overcame he found him not for he had broke his band and was returned again unto his dame to tell what tidings of fair florimell became cant. viii the witch creates a snowy lady like to florimell who wronged by carl by proteus saved is sought by paridell so oft as i this history record my heart does melt with mere compassion to think how causeless of her own accord this gentle damosel whom i write upon should plunged be in such affliction without all hope of comfort or relief that sure i ween the hardest heart of stone would hardly find to aggravate her grief for misery craves rather mercy then reprieve but that accursed hag her hostess late had so enrankled her malicious heart that she desired th'abridgement of her fate or long enlargement of her painful smart now when the beast which by her wicked art late forth she sent she back returning spied tide with her broken girdle it a part of her rich spoils whom he had erst destroyed she weened and wondrous gladness to her heart applied and with it running hastily to her son thought with that sighed him much to have relived who thereby deeming sure the thing as done his former grief with fury fresh revived much more then erst and would have algates rived the heart out of his breast for sith her dead he surely deemed himself he thought deprived quite of all hope where with he long had fed his foolish malady and long time had misled with thought whereof exceeding mad he grew and in his rage his mother would have slain had she not fled into a secret mew where she was wont her sprights to entertain the masters of her art there was she feign to call them all in order to her aid and them conjure upon eternal pain to counsel her so carefully dismayed how she might heal her son whose senses were decayed by their advise and her own wicked wit she there devise a wondrous work to frame whose like on earth was never framed yet that even nature self envied the same and grudged to see the counterfeit should shame the thing it self in hand she boldly took to make another like the former dame another florimell in shape and look so lively and so like that many it mistook the substance whereof she the body made was purest snow in massy mould congealed which she had gathered in a shady glade of the riphoean hills to her revealed by errant sprights but from all men concealed the same she tempered with fine mercury and virgin wex that never yet was sealed and mingled them with perfect vermeil that like a lively sanguine it seemed to the eye in stead of eyes two burning lamps she set in silver sockets shining like the skies and a quick moving spirit did arrest to stir and roll them like a woman's eyes in stead of yellow locks she did devise with golden wire to weave her curled head yet golden wire was not so yellow thrice as florimells fair hair and in the stead of life she put a spright to rule the carcase dead a wicked sprightyfraught with fawning guile and fair resemblance above all the rest which with the prince of darkness fell lomewhile from heavens bliss and everlasting rest him needed not instruct which way were best himself to fashion likest florimell ne how to speak ne how to use his gest for he in counterfeasance did excel and all the wiles of women's wits knew passing well him shaped thus she decked in garments gay which florimell had left behind her late that who so then her saw would surely say it was her self whom it did imitate or fairer then her self if ought algate might fairer be and then she forth her brought unto her son that lay in feeble state who seeing her gan straight upstarted and thought she was the lady self who he so long had sought tho fast her clipping betwixt his arms twaine extremely joyed in so happy sighed and soon forgotten his former sickly pain but she the more to seem such as she hight coily rebutted his embracement light yet still with gentle countenant retained enough to hold a fool in vain delight him long she so with shadows entertained as her creatress had in charge to her ordained till on a day as he disposed was to walk the woods with that his idol fair her to disport and idle time to pass in open freshness of the gentle air a knight that way there chanced to repair yet knight was not but a boastful swain that deeds of arms had ever in despair proud braggadocchio that in vaunting vain his glory did repose and credit did maintain he seeing with that churl so fair a wight decked with many a costly ornament much marveled thereat as well he might and thought that match a fowl disparagement his bloody spear eftsoons he boldly bent against the silly clown who dead through fear fell straight to ground in great astonishment villain said he this lady is my deer die if thou it gainsay i will away her bear the fearful churl durst not gainsay nor do but trembling stood and yielded him the pray who finding little leisure her to woo on tromparts steed her mounted without stay and without rescue led her quite away proud man himself then braggadocchio deemed and next to none after that happy day being possessed of that spoil which seemed the fairest wight on ground and most of men esteemed but when he saw himself free from pursuit he gan make gentle purpose to his dame with terms of love and lewdness dissolute for he could well his glozing speeches frame to such vain uses that him best became but she thereto would lend but light regard as seeming sorry that she ever came into his pour that used her so hard to reave her honour which she more then life preferred thus as they two of kindness treated long there them by chance encountered on the way and armed knight upon a courser strong whose trampling feet upon the hollow lay seemed to thunder and did nigh affray that capons courage yet he looked grim and feigned to cheer his lady in dismay who seemed for fear to quake in every limb and her to save from outrage meekly prayed him fiercely that stranger forward came and nigh approaching with bold words and bitter threat bade that same boaster as he mote on high to leave to him that lady for excheat or bide him battle without further treat that challenge did too peremptory seem and filled his senses with abashment great yet seeing nigh him jeopardy extreme he it dissembled well and light seemed to esteem saying thou foolish knight that weenest with words to steal away that i with blows have won and brought through points of many perilous swords but if thee list to see thy courser run or prove thy self this sad encounter shun and seek else without hazard of thy head at those proud words that other knight begun to wax exceeding wroth and him aread to turn his steed about or sure he should be dead sith then said braggadocchio needs thou wilt thy days abridge through proof of puissance turn we our steeds that both in equal tilt may meet again and each take happy chance this said they both a furlongs mountenance retired their steeds to run in even raze but braggadocchio with his bloody lance once having turned no more returned his face but left his love to loss and fled himself apace the knight him seeing fly had no regard him to pursue but to the lady road and having her from trompart lightly reared upon his courser set the lovely load and with her fled away without abided well weened he that fairest florimell it was with whom in company he yode and so her self did always to him tell so made him think him self in heaven that was in hell but florimell her self was far away driven to great distress by fortune strange and taught the careful mariner to play sith late mischance had her compelled to change the land for sea at random there to range yet there that cruel queen avengeress not satisfied so far her to estrange from courtly bliss and wonted happiness did heap on her new waves of weary wretchedness for being fled into the fishers boat for refuge from the monsters cruelty long so she on the mighty main did float and with the tide drove forward carelessly for th'aire was mild and cleared was the sky and all his winds dan aeolus did keep from stirring up their stormy enmity as pitying to see her wail and weep but all the while the fisher did securely sleep at last when drunk with drowsiness he woke and saw his drover driven along the stream he was dismayed and thrice his breast he stroke for marvel of that accident extreme but when he saw that blazing beauty's beam which with rare light his boat did beautify he marveled more and thought he yet did dream not well awaked or that some ecstasy assotted had his sense or dazed was his eye but when her well advising he perceived to be no vision nor fantastic sighed great comfort of her presence he conceived and felt in his old courage new delight to gin awake and stir his frozen spright though rudely asked her how she thither came ah said she father i note read aright what hard misfortune brought me to the same yet am i glad that here i now in safety am but thou good man sith far in sea we be and the great waters gin apace to swell that now no more we can the mainland see have care i pray to guide the cockboat well lest worse on sea then us on land befell thereat th'old man did nought but fondly grin and said his boat the way could wisely tell but his deceitful eyes did never lin to look on her fair face and mark her snowy skin the sighed whereof in his congealed flesh infixed such secret sting of greedy lust that the dry withered stock it gan refresh and kindled heat that soon in flame forth burst the driest wood is soonest burned to dust rudely to her he leapt and his rough hand where ill became him rashly would have thrust but she with angry scorn him did withstand and shamefully reproved for his rudeness found but he that never good nor manners knew her sharp rebuke full little did esteem hard is to teach and old horse amble true the inward smoke that did before but steam broke into open fire and rage extreme and now he strength gan add unto his will forcing to do that did him fowl misseem beastly he threw her down ne cared to spill her garments gay with scales of fish that all did fill the silly virgin strove him to withstand all that she might and him in vain reviled she struggled strongly both with foot and hand to save her honour from that villain vild and cried to heaven from humane help exiled o you brave knights that boast this ladies love where be you now when she is nigh defiled of filthy wretch well may she you reprove of falsehood or of sloth when most it may behoove but if that thou sir satyran didst weet or thou sir peridure her sorry state how soon would ye assemble many a fleet to fetch from sea that you at land lost late towers cities kingdoms you would ruinate in your avengement and dispiteous rage ne ought your burning fury mote abate but if sir calidore could it presage no living creature could his cruelty assuage but sith that none of all her knights is nigh see how the heavens of voluntary grace and sovereign favour towards chastity do succour send to her distressed case so much high god does innocence embrace it fortuned whilst thus she stiffly strove and the wide sea importuned long space with shrilling shrieks proteus abroad did rove along the foamy waves driving his finny drove proteus is shepherd of the seas of yore and hath the charge of neptunes mighty herd and aged sire with head all frowy hoar and sprinkled frost upon his dewy beard who when those pitiful outcries he herd through all the seas so ruefully resound his chariot swift in haste he thither steered which with a teem of scaly phocas bound was drawn upon the waves that foamed him around and coming to that fishers wandering boat that went at will withouten card or sail he therein saw that irksome sighed which smote deep indignation and compassion frail into his heart atonce straight did he hail the greedy villain from his hoped prey of which he now did very little fail and with his staff that drives his herd astray him bet so soar that life and sense did much dismay the while the piteous lady up did rise ruffled and foully arrayed with filthy soil and blubbered face with tears of her fair eyes her heart nigh broken was with weary toil to save her self from that outrageous spoil but when she looked up to weet what wight had her from so infamous fact assoiled for shame but more for fear of his grim sighed down in her lap she hid her face and loudly shright her self not saved yet from danger dreaded she thought but changed from one to other fear like as a fearful partridge that is sled from the sharp hawk which her attached near and falls to ground to seek for succour there whereas the hungry spaniels she does spy with greedy jaws her ready for to tear in such distress and sad perplexity was florimell when proteus she did see thereby but he endeavoured with speeches mild her to recomfort and accourage bold bidding her fear no more her foeman vild nor doubt himself and who he was her told yet all that could not from affright her hold ne to recomfort her at all prevailed for her faint heart was with the frozen cold benumbed so inly that her wits nigh failed and all her senses with abashment quite were quailed her up betwixt his rugged hands he reared and with his frory lips full softly kissed while the cold icicles from his rough beard dropped adown upon her ivory breast yet he himself so busily addressed that her out of astonishment he wrought and out of that same fishers filthy nest removing her into his chariot brought and there with many gentle terms her fair besought but that old lecher which with bold assault that beauty durst presume to violate he cast to punish for his heinous fault then took he him yet trembling sith of late and tied behind his chariot to aggrate the virgin whom he had abused so soar so dragged him through the waves in scornful state and after cast him up upon the shore but florimell with him unto his bower he boar his bower is in the bottom of the main under a mighty rock gainst which do rave the roaring billows in their proud disdain that with the angry working of the wave therein is eaten out and hollow cave that seems rough masons hand with engines keen had long while laboured it to engrave there was his won ne living wight was seen save one old nymph hight panope to keep it clean thither he brought the sorry florimell and entertained her the best he might and panope her entertained eke well as and immortal mote a mortal wight to win her liking unto his delight with flattering words he sweetly wooed her and offered fair gifts t'allure her sighed but she both offers and the offerer despised and all the fawning of the flatterer daily he tempted her with this or that and never suffered her to be at rest but evermore she him refused flat and all his feigned kindness did detest so firmly she had sealed up her breast sometime he boasted that a god he hight but she a mortal creature loved best then he would make himself a mortal wight but then she said she loved none but a faery knight then like a faery knight himself he dressed for every shape on him he could endue then like a king he was to her expressed and offered kingdoms unto her in view to be his leman and his lady true but when all this he nothing saw prevail with harder means he cast her to subdue and with sharp threats her often did assail so thinking for to make her stubborn courage quail to dreadful shapes he did himself transform now like a giant now like to a fiend then like a centaur then like to a storm raging within the waves thereby he weened her will to win unto his wished end but when with fear nor favour nor with all he else could do he saw himself esteemed down in a dungeon deep he let her fallen and threatened there to make her his eternal thrall eternal thraldom was to her more lief then loss of chastity or change of love die had she rather in tormenting grief then any should of falseness her reprove or looseness that she lightly did remove most virtuous virgin glory be thy meed and crown of heavenly praise with saints above where most sweet hymns of this thy famous deed are still amongst them song that far my rhymes exceed fit song of angels caroled to be but yet what so my feeble muse can frame shall be advance thy goodly chastity and to enrol thy memorable name in th'heart of every honourable dame that they thy virtuous deeds may imitate and be partakers of thy endless fame it irks me leave thee in this woeful state to tell of satyrane where i him left of late who having ended with that squire of dams a long discourse of his adventures vain the which himself then ladies more defames and finding not th'hyena to be slain with that same squire returned back again to his first way and as they forward went they spied a knight fair pricking on the plain as if he were on some adventure bent and in his port appeared manly hardiment sir satyrane him towards did address to weet what wight he was and what his quest and coming nigh eftsoons he gan to guess both by the burning heart which on his breast he bore and by the colours in his crest that paridell it was tho to him yode and him saluting as beseemed best gan first inquire of tidings far abroad and afterwards on what adventure now he road who thereto answering said the tidings bad which now in faery court all men do tell which turned hath great mirth to mourning sad is the late ruin of proud marinell and sudden parture of fair florimell to find him forth and after her are gone all the brave knights that done in arms excel to safeguard her wandered all alone amongst the rest my lot unworthy is to be one ah gentle knight said then sir satyrane thy labour all is lost i greatly dread that hast a thankless service on thee taken and offerest sacrifice unto the dead for dead i surely doubt thou mayest aread henceforth for ever florimell to be that all the noble knights of maidenhead which her adored may soar repent with me and all fair ladies may for ever sorry be which words when paridell had herd his hew gan greatly change and seemed dismayed to be then said fair sir how may i ween it true that you do tell in such uncertainty or speak you of report or did you see just cause of dread that makes you doubt so soar for perdy else how mote it ever be that ever hand should dare for to engore her noble blood the heavens such cruelty abhor these eyes did see that they will ever rew to-have seen quoth he when as a monstrous beast the palfrey whereon she did travel slew and of his bowels made his bloody feast which speaking token shows at the least her certain loss if not her sure decay beside that more suspicion increased i found her golden girdle cast astray distained with dirt and blood as relic of the prey aye me said paridell the signs be sad and but god turn the same to good soothsay that ladies safety is soar to be dread yet will i not forsake my forward way till trial do more certain truth bewray fair sir quoth he well may it you succeed ne long shall satyrane behind you stay but to the rest which in this quest proceed my labour add and be partaker of their speed the noble knights said then the squire of dams well may you speed in so praiseworthy pain but sith the sun now begins to slake his beams in dewy vapours of the western main and loose the teem out of his weary wain more not mislike you also to abate your zealous haste till morrow next again both light of heaven and strength of men relate which if you please to yonder castle turn your gate that counsel pleased well so all yfere forth marched to a castle them before here soon arriving they restrained were of ready entrance which ought evermore to errant knights be common wondrous soar thereat displeased they were till that young squire gan them inform the cause why that same door was shut to all which lodging did desire the which to let you weet will further time require cant. ix malbecco will no strange knights host for pecuish jealousy paridell jousts with britomart both show their ancestry redoubted knights and honourable dams to whom i level all my labours end right soar i fear lest with unworthy blames this odious argument my rhymes should shend or ought your goodly patience offend while of a wanton lady i do write which with her lose incontinence does blend the shining glory of your sovereign light and knighthood fowl defaced by a faithless knight but never let ensample of the bad offend the good for good by paragon of evil may more notably be read as white seems fairer matched with black atone ne all are shamed by the fault of one for lo in heaven whereas all goodness is amongst the angels a whole legion of wicked sprights did fallen from happy bliss what wonder then if one of women all did miss then listen lordings if you list to weet the cause why satyrane and paridell mote not be entertained as seemed meet into that castle as that squire does tell therein a cankered crabbed carl does dwell that has no skill of court nor courtesy ne cares what men say of him ill or well for all his days he drowns in privity yet has full large to live and spend at liberty but all his mind is set on mucky pelf to hoard up heaps of evil got mass for which he others wrongs and wrecks himself yet is he linked to a lovely lass whose beauty does her bounty far surpass the which to him both far unequal years and also far unlike conditions has for she does joy to play amongst her pears and to be free from hard restraint and jealous fears but he is old and withered like hay unfit fair ladies service to supply the privy guilt whereof makes him always suspect her truth and keep continual spy upon her with his other blinked eye ne suffers he resort of living wight approach to her ne keep her company but in close bower her mews from all men's sighed deprived of kindly joy and natural delight malbecco he and hellenore she hight unfitly yoked together in one teem that is the cause why never any knight it suffered here to enter but he seem such as no doubt of him he need misdeem thereat sir satyrane gan smile and say extremely mad the man i surely deem that weens with watch and hard restraint to stay a woman's will which is disposed to go astray in vain he fears that which he cannot shun for who wots not that woman's subtleties can guilen argus when she list misdone it is not iron bands nor hundred eyes nor brazen walls nor many wakeful spies that can withhold her wilful wandering feet but fast good will with gentle courtesies and timely service to her pleasures meet may her perhaps contain that else would algates fleet then is he not more mad said paridell that hath himself unto such service sold in doleful thraldom all his days to dwell for sure a fool i do him firmly hold that loves his fetters though they were of gold but why do we devise of others ill while thus we suffer this same dotard old to keep us out in scorn of his own will and rather do not ransack all and him self kill nay let us first said satyrane entreat the man by gentle means to let us in and afterwards affray with cruel threat ere that we to efforce it do begin then if all fail we will by force it win and eke reward the wretch for his misprise as may be worthy of his heinous since that counsel pleased then paridell did rise and to the castle gate approached in quiet wise whereat soft knocking entrance he desired the good man self which then the porter played him answered that all were now retired unto their rest and all the keys conveyed unto their master who in bed was laid that none him durst awake out of his dream and therefore them of patience gently prayed then paridell began to change his theme and threatened him with force & punishment extreme but all in vain for nought mote him relent and now so long before the wicket fast they waited that the night was forward spent and the fair welkin foully overcast gan blown up a bitter stormy blast with shower and hail so horrible and dreaded that this fair many were compelled at last to fly for succour to a little shed the which beside the gate for swine was ordered it fortuned soon after they were gone another knight whom tempest thither brought came to that castle and with earnest moan like as the rest late entrance deer besought but like so as the rest he prayed for nought for flatly he of entrance was refused sorely thereat he was displeased and thought how to avenge himself so soar abused and evermore the carl of courtesy accused but to avoid intolerable stour he was compelled to seek some refuge near and to that shed to shroud him from the shower he came which full of guests he found why lere so as he was not let to enter there whereat he gan to wex exceeding wroth and swore that he would lodge with them yfere or them dislodge all were they lief orloth and defied them each and so defied them both both were full loath to leave that needful tent and both full loath in darkness to debate yet both full lief him lodging to have lent and both full lief his boasting to abate but chiefly paridell his heart did grate to hear him threaten so despitefully as if he did a dog to kennel rate that durst not bark and rather had he die then when he was deside in coward cornerly tho hastily remounting to his steed he forth issued like as a boisterous wind which in earths hollow caves hath long been hid and shut up fast within her prisons blind makes the huge element against her kind to move and tremble as it were aghast until that it and issue forth may find then forth it breaks and with his furious blast confounds both land & seas and skies does overcast their stellhead spears they strongly couched and met together with impetuous rage and force that with the terror of their fierce affret they rudely drove to ground both man and horse that each awhile lay like a senseless corpse but paridell soar bruised with the blow could not arise the counterchange to scorse till that young squire him reared from below then drew he his bright sword & gan about him throw but satyrane forth stepping did them stay and with fair treaty pacified their ire then when they were accorded from the fray against that castles lord they gan conspire to heap on him due vengeance for his hire they be agreed and to the gates they go to burn the same with unquenchable fire and that uncourteous carl their commune foe to do fowl death to die or wrap in grievous woe malbecco seeing them resolved in deed to flame the gates and hearing them to call for fire in earnest ran with fearful speed and to them calling from the castle wall besought them humbly him to bear with all as ignorant of servants bad abuse and slack attendance unto strangers call the knights were willing all things to excuse though nought believed & entrance late did not refuse they be brought into a comely bower and served of all things that mote needful be yet secretly their host did on them lower and welcomed more for fear then charity but they dissembled what they did not see and welcomed themselves each gan undight their garments wet and weary armour free to dry them selves by vulcanes flaming light and eke their lately bruised parts to bring in plighted and eke that stranger knight amongst the rest was for like need inforced to disarray though whenas veiled was her lofty crest her golden locks that were in trammel's gay upbounden did them selves adown display and reached unto her heals like sunny beams that in a cloud their light did long time stay their vapour vaded show their golden gleams and through the perceant air shoot forth their azure streams she also doffed her heavy habergeon which the fair feature of her limbs did hide and her well plighted frock which she did wone to tuck about her short when she did ride she low let fallen that flowed from her lank side down to her foot with careless modesty then of them all she plainly was espied to be a woman wight unwist to be the fairest woman wight that ever eye did see like as minerua being late returned from slaughter of the giants conquered where proud encelade whose wide nosethrills burned with breathed flames like to a furnace read transfixed with the spear down tumbled dead from top of hemus by him heaped high hath loosed her helmet from her lofty head and her gorgonian shield begins to untie from her left arm to rest in glorious victory which whenas they beheld they smitten were with great amazement of so wondrous sighed and each on other and they all on her stood gazing as if sudden great affright had them surprised at last advising right her goodly personage and glorious hew which they so much mistook they took delight in their first error and yet still anew with wonder of her beauty fed their hungry view yet note their hungry view be satisfied but seeing still the more desired to see and ever firmly fixed did abide in contemplation of divinity but they marveled at her chivalry and noble prowess which they had approved that much they feigned to know who she mote be yet none of all them her thereof moved yet every one her liked and every one her loved and paridell though partly discontent with his late fallen and fowl indignity yet was soon won his malice to relent through gracious regard of her fair eye and knightly worth which he too late did try yet tried did adore supper was dight then they malbecco prayed of courtesy that of his lady they might have the sighed and company at meat to do them more delight but he to shift their curious request gan causen why she could not come in place her crazed health her late recourse to rest and humid evening ill for sick folks case but none of those excuses could take place ne would they eat till she in presence came she came in presence with right comely grace and fairly them saluted as became and showed her self in all a gentle courteous dame they sat to meat and satyrane his chance was her before and paridell beside but he him self sat looking still askance gainst britomart and ever closely eyed sir satyrane that glances might not glide but his blind eye that sided paridell all his demeanour from his sighed did hide on her fair face so did he feed his fill and sent close messages of love to her at will and ever and anon when none was ware with speaking looks that close embassage boar he roved at her and told his secret care for all that art he learned had ofyore ne was she ignorant of that lewd lore but in his eye his meaning wisely read and with the like him answered evermore she sent at him one firy dart whose head empoisoned was with privy lust and jealous dreaded he from that deadly throw made no defence but to the wound his weak heart opened wide the wicked engine through false influence passed through his eyes and secretly did glide into his heart which it did sorely gride but nothing new to him was that same pain ne pain at all for he so oft had tried the pour thereof and loved so oft in vain that thing of course he counted love to entertain thenceforth to her he sought to intimate his inward grief by means to him well known now bacchus fruit out of the silver plate he on the table dashed as overthrown or of the fruitful liquour overflown and by the dancing bubbles did divine or therein write to let his love be shown which well she read out of the learned line a sacrament profane in mystery of wine and when so of his hand the pledge she reached the guilty cup she feigned to mistake and in her lap did shed her idle draught showing desire her inward flame to slake by such close signs they secret way did make unto their wills and one eyes watch escape two eyes him needs for to watch and wake who lovers will deceive thus was the ape by their fair handling put into malbeccoes cape now when of meats and drinks they had their fill purpose was moved by that gentle dame unto those knights adventurous to tell of deeds of arms which unto them became and every one his kindred and his name then paridell in whom a kindly pride of gracious speech and skill his words to frame abounded being glad of so fit tied him to commend to her thus spoke of all well eyed troy that art now nought but and idle name and in thine ashes buried low dost lie though whilom far much greater then thy fame before that angry gods and cruel sky upon thee heaped a direful destiny what boots it boast thy glorious descent and fetch from heaven thy great genealogy sith all thy worthy praises being blended their offspring hath embased and later glory shent most famous worthy of the world by whom that war was kindled which did troy inflame and stately towers of ilion whilom brought unto baleful ruin was by name sir paris far renowned through noble fame who through great prowess and bold hardiness from lacedaemon fetched the fairest dame that ever greece did boast or knight possess whom venus to him gave for meed of worthiness fair helene flower of beauty excellent and garland of the mighty conquerors that madest many ladies deer lament the heavy loss of their brave paramours which they far off beheld from trojan

derive aright who long before the ten years siege of troy while yet on ida he a shepherd hight on fair oenone god a lovely boy whom for remembrance of her passed joy she of his father parius did name who after greeks did priams realm destroy gathered the trojan relics saved from flame and with them sailing thence to th'isle of paros came that was by him called paros which before hight nausa there he many years did rain and built nausicle by the pontic shore the which he dying left next in remain to paridas his son from whom i paridell by kin descend but for fair ladies love and glories gain my native soil have left my days to spend in seewing deeds of arms my lives and labours end when as the noble britomart herd tell of trojan wars and priams city sacked the rueful story of sir paridell she was impassioned at that piteous act with zealous envy of greeks cruel fact against that nation from whose raze of old she herd that she was lineally extract for noble britons sprung from trojans bold and troynouant was built of old troyes ashes cold then sighing soft awhile at last she thus oh lamentable fallen of famous town which reigned so many years victorious and of all asie boar the sovereign crown in one sad night consumed and thrown down what stony heart that hears thy hapless fate is not empierced with deep compassion and makes ensample of men wretched state that flowers so fresh at morn and fades at evening late behold sir how your pitiful complaint hath found another partner of your pain for nothing may impress so deer constraint as countries cause and commune foes disdain but if it should not grieve you back again to turn your course i would to hear desire what to aeneas fell sith that men say he was not in the cities woeful fire consumed but did him self to safety retire anchyses son begotten of venus fair said he out of the flames for safeguard fled and with a remnant did to sea repair where he through fatal error long was led full many years and weetless wandered from shore to shore amongst the lybic sands ere rest he found much there he suffered and many perils passed in foreign lands to save his people sad from victor's vengeful hands at last in latium he did arrive where he with cruel war was entertained of inland folk which sought him back to driven till he with old latinus was constrained to contract wedlock so the fates ordained wedlock contract in blood and eke in blood accomplished that many deer complained the rival slain the victor through the flood escaped hardly hardly praised his wedlock good yet after all he victor did survive and with latinus did the kingdom part but after when both nations gan to strive into their names the title to convert his son iülus did from thence depart with all the warlike youth of trojans blood and in long alba placed his throne apart where fair it flourished and long time stood till romulus renewing it to room removed there there said britomart a fresh appeared the glory of the later world to spring and troy again out of her dust was reared to fit in second seat of sovereign king of all the world under her governing but a third kingdom yet is to arise out of the trojans scattered offspring that in all glory and great enterprise both first and second troy shall dare to equalise it troynouant is hight that with the waves of wealthy thamis washed is along upon whose stubborn neck whereat he raves with roaring rage and soar him self does throng that all men fear to tempt his billows strong she fastened hath her foot which stands so high that it a wonder of the world is song in foreign lands and all which passen by beholding it from far do think it threats the sky the trojan brutus did first that city found and hygate gate made the mere thereof by west and overt gate by north that is the bound towards the land two rivers bound the rest so huge a scope at first him seemed best to be the compass of his kingdoms seat so huge a mind could not in lesser rest ne in small meres contain his glory great that albion had conquered first by warlike feat ah fairest lady knight said paridell pardon i pray my heedless oversight who had forgotten that whilom i herd tell from aged mnemon for my wits be light indeed he said if i remember right that of the antique trojan stock there grew another plant that reached to wondrous hight and far abroad his mighty branches threw into the utmost angle of the world he knew for that same brutus whom much he did advance in all his speech was syluius his son whom having slain through luckless arrows glance he fled for fear of that he had misdone or else for shame so fowl reproach to shun and with him led to the sea and youthly train where weary wandering they long time did won and many fortune's proved in ocean main and great adventures found that now were long to say at last by fatal course they driven were into and island spacious and broad the furthest north that did to them appear which after rest they seeking far abroad found it the fittest soil for their abided fruitful of all things fit for living food but wholly wast and void of peoples trodden save and huge nation of the giants brood that fed on living flesh & drunk men's vital blood whom he through weary wars and labours long subdued with loss of many britons bold in which the great goemagot of strong corineus and coulin of debon old were overthrown and laid on earth full cold which quaked under their so hideous mass a famous history to be enrolled in everlasting monuments of brass that all the antique worthies merits far did pass his work great troynouant his work is eke fair lincolne both renowned far away that who from east to west will endlong seek cannot two fairer cities find this day except cleopolis so herd i say old mnemon therefore sir i greet you well your country kin and you entirely pray of pardon for the strife which late besell betwixt us both unknown so ended paridell but all the while that he these speeches spent upon his lips hung fair dame hellenore with vigilant regard and due attended fashioning world's of fancies evermore in her frail wit that now her quite forlore the while unwares away her wondering eye and greedy ears her weak heart from her boar which he perceiving ever privily in speaking many false belgard's at her let fly so long these knights discoursed diversely of strange affairs and noble hardiment which they had passed with much jeopardy that now the humid night was farforth spent and heavenly lamps were halfendeal brent which th'old man seeing well who too long thought every discourse and every argument which by the hours he measured besought them go to rest so all unto their bowers were brought cant. x. paridell rapes hellenore malbecco her purswes finds amongst satires whence with him to turn she does refuse the morrow next so soon as phoebus lamp bewrayed had the world with early light and fresh aurora had the shady damp out of the goodly heaven moved quite fair britomart and that same faery knight uprose forth on their journey for to weened but paridell complained that his late fight with britomart so soar did him offend that ride he could not till his hurts he did amend so forth they fared but he behind them stayed maugre his host who grudged grievously to house a guest that would be needs obeyed and of his own him left not liberty might wanting measure moves surquedry two things he feared but the third was death that fierce youngman's unruly mastery his money which he loved as living breath and his fair wife whom honest long he kept uneath but patience perforce he must aby what fortune and his fate on him will lay found is the fear that finds no remedy yet warily he watches every way by which he fears evil happen may so evil thinks by watching to prevent ne does he suffer her nor night nor day out of his sighed her self once to absent so does he punish her and eke himself torment but paridell kept better watch then he a fit occasion for his turn to find false love why do men say thou canst not see and in their foolish fancy feign thee blind that with thy charms the sharpest sighed dost bind and to thy will abuse thou walkest free and seest every secret of the mind thou seest all yet none at all sees thee all that is by the working of thy deity so perfect in that art was paridell that he melbeccoes halfen eye did wile his halfen eye he wiled wondrous well and hellenors both eyes did eke beguile both eyes and heart atonce during the while that he there sojourned his wounds to heal that cupid self it seeing close did smile to weet how he her love away did steal and bad that none their joyous treason should reveal the learned lover lost no time nor tied that least advantage mote to him afford yet boar so fair a sail that none espied his secret drift till he her laid aboard when so in open place and commune board he fortuned her to meet with commune speech he courted her yet baited every word that his ungentle host no'te him appeach of vile ungentleness or hospitages breach but when apart if ever her apart he found then his false engines fast he plied and all the sleights unbosomed in his heart he sighed he sobbed he swoon he perdy died and cast himself on ground her fast beside though when again he him bethought to live he wept and wailed and false laments belied saying but if she mercy would him give that he mote algates die yet did his death forgive and otherwhiles with amorous delights and pleasing toys he would her entertain now singing sweetly to surprise her sprights now making lays of love and lovers pain bransles ballads virelays and verses vain oft purposes oft riddles he devised and thousands like which flowed in his brain with which he fed her fancy and enticed to take to his new love and leave her old despised and every where he might and every while he did her service dutiful and sewed at hand with humble pride and pleasing guile so closely yet that none but she it viewed who well perceived all and all endued thus finely did he his false nets dispread with which he many weak hearts had subdued of yore and many had alike misled what wonder then if she were likewise carried no fort so sensible no walls so strong but that continual battery will rive or daily siege through dispurveyance long and lack of rescues will to parley driven and peace that unto parley ear will give will shortly yield it self and will be made the vassal of the victor's will by live that stratagem had oftentimes assayed this crafty paramour and now it plain displayed for through his trains he her entrapped hath that she her love and heart hath wholly sold to him without regard of gain or scathe or care of credit or of husband old whom she hath vowed to dub a fair cuckold nought wants but time and place which shortly she devised hath and to her lover told it pleased well so well they both agree so ready ripe to ill ill women's counsels be dark was the evening fit for lovers stealth when chanced melbecco busy be elsewhere she to his closet went where all his wealth lay hid thereof she countless sums did rear the which she meant away with her to bear the rest she fired for sport or for despite as hellene when she saw aloft appear the trojan flames and reach to heavens hight did clap her hands and joyed at that doleful sighed this second hellene fair dame hellenore the while her husband ran with sorry haste to quench the flames which she had tined before laughed at his foolish labour spent in waste and ran into her lovers arms right fast where straight embraced she to him did cry and call aloud for help ere help were passed for lo that guest would bear her forcibly and meant to ravish her that rather had to die the wretched man hearing her call for aid and ready seeing him with her to fly in his disquiet mind was much dismayed but when again he backward cast his eye and saw the wicked fire so furiously consume his heart and scorch his idols face he was therewith distressed diversely ne wist he how to turn nor to what place was never wretched man in such a woeful case ay when to him she cried to her he turned and left the fire love money overcame but when he marked how his money burned he left his wife money did love disclaim both was he loath to lose his loved dame and loath to leave his liefest pelf behind yet sith he no'te save both he saved that same which was the dearest to his dunghill mind the god of his desire the joy of misers blind thus whilst all things in troublous uproar were and all men busy to suppress the flame the loving couple need no rescue fear but leisure had and liberty to frame their purposed flight free from all men's reclaim and night the patroness of love-stealth fair gave them safe conduct till to end they came so be they gone yfere a wanton pair of lovers loosely knit where list them to repair soon as the cruel flames slaked were malbecco seeing how his loss did lie out of the flames which he had quenched whilere into huge waves of grief and jealousy full deep implunged was and drowned nigh betwixt inward dole and felonous despite he raved he wept he stamped he loud did cry and all the passion that in man may light did him atonce oppress and vex his caitiff spright long thus he chawed the cud of inward grief and did consume his gall with anguish soar still when he mused on his late mischief then still the smart thereof increased more and seemed more grievous then it was before at last when sorrow he saw booted nought ne grief might not his love to him restore he gan devise how her he rescue might ten thousand ways he cast in his confused thought at last resolving like a pilgrim poor to seach her forth where so she might be found and bearing with him treasure in close store the rest he leaves in ground so takes in hound to seek her endlong both by sea and land long he her sought he sought her far and never and every where that he mote understand of knights and ladies any meetings were and of eachone he met he tidings did inquire but all in vain his woman was too wise ever to come into his clouch again and he too simple ever to surprise the jolly paridell for all his pain one day as he forpassed by the plain with weary pace he far away espied a couple seeming well to be his twaine which hoved close under a forest side as if they lay in wait or else themselves did hide well weened he that those the same mote be and as he better did their shape avise him seemed more their manner did agree for th'one was armed all in warlike wise whom to be paridell he did devise and th'other all clad in garments light discoloured like to womanish disguise he did resemble to his lady bright and ever his faint heart much earned at the sighed and ever feign he towards them would go but yet durst not for dread approachen nigh but stood aloof unweeting what to do till that pricked forth with loves extremity that is the father of foul jealousy he closely nearer crept the truth to weet but as he nigher drew he easily might discern that it was not his sweetest sweet ne yet her belamour the partner of his sheet but it was scornful braggadocchio that with his servant trompart hovered there sith late he fled from his too earnest foe whom such when as malbecco spied clear he turned back and would have fled arear till trompart running hastily him did stay and bade before his sovereign lord appear that was him loath yet durst he not gainsay and coming him before low louted on the lay the boaster at him sternly bent his brow as if he could have killed him with his look that to the ground him meekly made to bow and awful terror deep into him struck that every member of his body quaked said he thou man of nought what dost thou here unfitly furnished with thy bag and book where i expected one with shield and spear to prove some deeds of arms upon and equal peer the wretched man at his imperious speech was all abashed and low prostrating said good sir let not my rudedesse be no breach unto your patience ne be ill payed for i unwares this way by fortune strayed a silly pilgrim driven to distress that seek a lady there he sudden stayed and did the rest with grievous sighs suppress while tears stood in his eyes few drops of bitterness what lady man said trompart take good heart and tell thy grief if any hidden lie was never better time to show thy smart then now that noble succour is thee by that is the whole world's commune remedy that cheerful word his weak heart much did cheer and with vain hope his spirits faint supply that bold he said o most redoubted peer vouchsafe with mild regard a wretches case to hear then sighing soar it is not long said he sith i enjoyed the gentlest dame alive of whom a knight no knight at all perdy but shame of all that do for honour strive by treacherous deceit did me deprive through open outrage he her boar away and with fowl force unto his will did driven which all good knights that arms do bear this day are bound for to revenge and punish if they may and you most noble lord that can and dare redress the wrong of miserable wight cannot employ your most victorious spear in better quarrel then defence of right and for a lady gainst a faithless knight so shall your glory be advanced much and all fair ladies magnify your might and eke my self albe i simple such your worthy pain shall well reward with guerdon rich with that out of his bouget forth he drew great store of treasure therewith him to tempt but he on it looked scornfully askew as much disdaining to be so misdeemed or a warmonger to be basely nempt and said thy offers base i greatly loath and eke thy words uncourteous and unkempt i tread in dust thee and thy money both that were it not for shame so turned from him wroth but trompart that his masters humour knew in lofty looks to hide and humble mind was inly tickled with that golden view and in his ear him grounded close behind yet stooped he not but lay still in the wind waiting advantage on the prey to seize till trompart lowly to the ground inclined besought him his great courage to appease and pardon simple man that rash did him displease bigge looking like a doughty doucepere at last he thus thou clod of vilest clay i pardon yield and with thy rudeness bear but weet henceforth that all that golden prey and all that else the vain world vaunten may i loath as dung ne deem my due reward fame is my meed and glory virtues pray but minds of mortal men are mush marred and moved amiss with massy mucks' unmeet regard and more i grant to thy great misery gracious respect thy wife shall back be sent and that vile knight who ever that he be which hath thy lady rest and knighthood shent by sanglamort my sword whose deadly dent the blood hath of so many thousands shed i swear ere long shall dearly it repent ne he betwixt heaven and earth shall hide his head but soon he shall be found and shortly done be dead the foolish man thereat wox wondrous blithe as if the word so spoken were half done and humbly thanked him a thousand sith that had from death to life him newly won tho forth the boaster marching brave begun his stolen steed to thunder furiously as if he heaven and hell would overrun and all the world confound with cruelty that much malbecco joyed in his jollity thus long they three together traveled through many a wood and many and uncouth way to seek his wife that was far wandered but those two sought nought but the present prey to weet the treasure which he did bewray on which their eyes and hearts were wholly set with purpose how they might it best betray for sith the hour that first he did them let the same behold therewith their keen desires were whet it fortuned as they together fared they spied where paridell came pricking fast upon the plain the which himself prepared to joust with that brave stranger knight a cast as on adventure by the way he passed alone he road without his paragon for having filched her bells her up he cast to the wide world and let her fly alone he nould be clogged so had he served many one the gentle lady lose at random left the greenwood long did walk and wander wide at wild adventure like a forlorn west till on a day the satires her espied straying alone withouten groom or guide her up they took and with them home her led with them as housewife ever to abide to milk their goats and make them cheese and bred and every one as commune good her handled that shortly she malbecco has forgotten and eke sir paridell all were he deer who from her went to seek another lot and now by fortune was arrived here where those two guilers with malbecco were soon as the oldman saw sir paridell he fainted and was almost dead with fear ne word he had to speak his grief to tell but to him louted low and greeted goodly well and after asked him for hellenore i take no keep of her said paridell she wones in the forest there before so forth he road as his adventure fell the while the boaster from his lofty fell feigned to alight something amiss to mend but the fresh swain would not his leisure dwell but went his way whom when he passed kenned he up remounted light and after faindto weened perdy nay said malbecco shall you not but let him pass as lightly as he came for little good of him is to be god and much peril to be put to shame but let us go to seek my dearest dame whom he hath left in yonder forest wild for of her safety in great doubt i am lest salvage beasts her person have despoiled then all the world is lost and we in vain have toiled the all agree and forward them addressed ah but said crafty trompart weet you well that yonder in that wasteful wilderness huge monsters haunt and many dangers dwell dragons and minotaures and fiends of hell and many wild woodmen which rob and rend all travellers therefore advise you well before you enterprise that way to weened one may his journey bring too soon to evil end malbecco stopped in great astonishment and with pale eyes fast fixed on the rest their counsel craved in danger imminent said trompart you that are the most oppressed with burden of great treasure i think best here for to stay in safety behind my lord and i will search the wide forest that counsel pleased not malbeccoes mind for he was much afraid himself alone to find then is it best said he that you do leave your treasure here in some security either fast closed in some hollow grieve or buried in the ground from jeopardy till we return again in safety as for us two lest doubt of us you have hence far away we will blindfolded lie ne privy be unto your treasures graven it pleased so he did then they march forward brave now when amid the thickest woods they were they herd a noise of many bagpipes shrill and shrieking hubbubs them approaching never which all the forest did with horror fill that dreadful found the boaster's heart did thrill with such amazement that in haste he fled ne ever looked back for good or ill and after him eke fearful trompart sped the old man could not fly but fell to ground half dead yet afterwards close creeping as he might he in a bush did hide his fearful head the jolly satires full of fresh delight came dancing forth and with them nimbly led fair helenore with girlands all bespread whom their may-lady they had newly made she proud of that new honour which they read and of their lovely fellowship full glade danced lively and her face did with a laurel shade the silly man that in the thicket lay saw all this goodly sport and grieved soar yet durst he not against it do or say but did his heart with bitter thoughts engore to see unkindness of his hellenore all day they danced with great lustihood and with their horned feet the green grass wore the while their goats upon the browses fed till drooping phoebus gan to hide his golden head tho up they gan their merry pipes to truss and all their goodly heards did gather round but every satire first did give a buss to hellenore so busses did abound now gan the humid vapour shed the ground with pearly dew and th'earthes gloomy shade did dim the brightness of the welkin round that every bird and beast warned made to shroud themselves while sleep their senses did invade which when melbecco saw out of his bush upon his hand and feet he crept full light and like a goat amongst the goats did rush that through the help of his fair horns on hight and misty damp of misconceiving night and eke through likeness of his goatish beard he did the better counterfeit aright so home he marched amongst the horned herd that none of all the satires him espied or herd at night when all they went to sleep he viewed whereas his lovely wife amongst them lay embraced of a satire rough and rude who all the night did mind his joyous play nine times he herd him come aloft ere day that all his heart with jealousy did swell but yet that nights ensample did bewray that not for nought his wife them loved so well when one so oft a night did ring his matin's bell so closely as he could he to them crept when weary of their sport to sleep they fell and to his wife that now full soundly slept he whispered in her ear and did her tell that it was he which by her side did dwell and therefore prayed her wake to hear him plain as one out of a dream not waked well she turned her and returned back again yet her for to awake he did the more constrain at last with irksome trouble she abraid and then perceiving that it was indeed her old malbecco which did her upbraid with looseness of her love and loathly deed she was astonished with exceeding dread and would have waked the satire by her side but he her prayed for mercy or for meed to save his life ne let him be descried but harken to his lore and all his counsel hide tho gan he her persuade to leave that lewd and loathsome life of god and man abhorred and home return where all should be renewed with perfect peace and bands of fresh accord and she received again to bed and board as if no trespass ever had be done but she it all refused at one word and by no means would to his will be won but chosen amongst the jolly satires still to won he wooed her till day springs he espied but all in vain and then turned to the herd who butted him with horns on every side and trodden down in the dirt where his hoar beard was foully dight and he of death afeard early before the heavens fairest light out of the ruddy east was fully reared the herds out of their folds were loosed quite and he amongst the rest crept forth in sorry plighted so soon as he the prison door did pass he ran as fast as both his feet could bear and never looked who behind him was ne scarcely who before like as a bear that creeping close among the hives to rear and honey comb the wakeful dogs espy and him assailing soar his carcase tear that hardly he with life away does fly ne stays till safe himself he see from jeopardy ne stayed he till he came unto the place where late his treasure he entombed had where when he found it not for trompart base had it purloined for his master bad with extreme fury he became quite mad and ran away ran with himself away that who so strangely had him seen bestead with upstarted hair and staring eyes dismay from limbo lake him late escaped sure would say high over hills and over dales he fled as if the wind him on his wings had born ne bank nor bush could stay him when he sped his nimble feet as treading still on thorn grief and despite and jealousy and scorn did all the way him follow hard behind and he himself himself loathed so forlorn so shamefully forlorn of womankind that as a snake still lurked in his wounded mind still fled he forward looking backward still ne stayed his flight nor fearful agony till that he came unto a rocky hill over the sea suspended dreadfully that living creature it would terrify to look adown or upward to the hight from thence he threw himself dispiteously all desperate of his fore-damned spright that seemed no help for him was left in living sighed but through long anguish and self-murdering thought he was so wasted and forpined quite that all his substance was consumed to nought and nothing left but like and aery spright that on the rocks he fell so flit and light that he thereby received no hurt at all but chanced on a craggy cliff to light whence he with crooked claws so long did crawl that at the last he found a cave with entrance small into the same he creeps and thenceforth there resolved to built his baleful mansion in dreary darkness and continual fear of that rocks fallen which ever and anon threats with huge ruin him to fallen upon that he dare never sleep but that one eye still open he keeps for that occasion ne ever rests he in tranquillity the roaring billows beatrice his bower so boisterously ne ever is he wont on ought to feed but toads and frogs his pasture poisonous which in his cold complexion do breed a filthy blood or humour rancorous matter of doubt and dread suspicious that does with cureless care consume the heart corrupts the stomach with gall vicious crosscuts the liver with internal smart and does transfix the soul with deaths eternal dart yet can he never die but dying lives and does himself with sorrow new sustain that death and life atonce unto him gives and painful pleasure turns to pleasing pain there dwells he ever miserable swain hateful both to him self and every wight where he through privy grief and horror vain is waxed so deformed that he has quite forgotten he was a man and jealousy is hight cant. xi britomart chases ollyphant finds scudamour distressed assays the house of busyrane where loves spoils are expressed o hateful hellish snake what fury furst brought thee from baleful house of proserpine where in her bosom she thee long had nursed and fostered up with bitter milk of tine foul jealousy that turnest love divine to joyless dread and makest the loving heart with hateful thoughts to languish and to pine and feed it self with self-consuming smart of all the passion in the mind thou vilest art o let him far be banished away and in his stead let love for ever dwell sweet love that does his golding wings embay in blessed nectar and pure pleasures well untroubled of vile fear or bitter fell and you fair ladies that your kingdoms make in harts of men them govern wisely well and of fair britomart ensample take that was as true in love as turtle to her make who with sir satyrane as erst you read forth riding from malbeccoes hostless house far off espied a young man the which fled from and huge giant that with hideous and hateful outrage long him chased thus it was that ollyphant the brother deer of that argante vile and vicious from whom the squire of dams was rest why lere this all as bad as she and worse if worse ought were for as the sister did in feminine and filthy lust exceed all woman kind so he surpassed his sex masculine in beastly use that i did ever find whom when as britomart beheld behind the fearful boy so greedily pursue she was immoved in her noble mind t'employ her puissance to his rescue and pricked fiercely forward where she him did view ne was sir satyrane her far behind but with like fierceness did ensue the chase whom when the giant saw he sooone resigned his former suit and from them fled apace they after both and boldly bade him base and each did strive the other to outgo but he them both outran a wondrous space for he was long and swift as any roe and now made better speed escape his feared foe it was not satyrane whom he did fear but britomart the flower of chastity for he the pour of chaste hands might not bear but always did their dread encounter fly and now so fast his feet he did apply that he has got to a forest near where he is shrouded in security the wood they enter and search every where they searched diversely so both divided were fair britomart so long him followed that she at last came to a fountain shear by which there lay a knight all wallowed upon the grassy ground and by him near his habergeon his helmet and his spear a little off his shield was rudely thrown on which the winged boy in colours clear depainted was full easy to be known and he thereby where ever it in field was shown his face upon the ground did groveling lie as if he had be slumbering in the shade that the brave maid would not for courtesy out of his quiet slumber him abraid nor seem too suddenly him to invade still as she stood she herd with grievous throb him groan as if his heart were pieces made and with most painful pangs to sighs and sob that pity did the virgins heart of patience rob at last forth breaking into bitter plaints he said o sovereign lord that sittest on high and reignest in bliss amongst thy blessed saints how sufferest thou such shameful cruelty so long unwreaked of thine enemy or haste thou lord of good men's cause no heed or does thy justice sleep and silent lie what boots then the good and righteous deed if goodness find no grace nor righteousness no meed if good find grace and righteousness reward why then is amoret in caitiff band sith that more bounteous creature never fared on foot upon the face of living land or if that heavily justice may withstand the wrongful outrage of unrighteous men why then is busirane with wicked hand suffered these seuen months day in secret den my lady and my love so cruelly to pen my lady and my love is cruelly pend in doleful darkness from the view of day whilst deadly torments do her chaste breast rend and the sharp steel does rive her heart in tway all for she scudamore will not denay yet thou vile man vile scudamore art found ne canst her aid ne canst her foe dismay unworthy wretch to tread upon the ground for whom so fair a lady feels so soar a wound there and huge heap of singulfs did oppress his struggling soul and swelling throbs impeach his faltering tongue with pangs of dreariness choking the remnant of his plaintiff speech as if his days were come to their last reach which when she herd and saw the ghastly fit threatening into his life to make a breach both with great ruth and terror she was smit fearing lest from her cage the weary soul would flit tho stooping down she him moved light who therewith somewhat starting up gan look and seeing him behind a stranger knight whereas no living creature he mistook with great indignance he that sighed forsook and down again himself disdainfully abjecting earth with his fair forehead struck which the bold virgin seeing gan apply fit medicine to his grief and spoke thus courteously ah gentle knight whose deep cenceiued grief well seems t'exceede the pour of patience yet if that heavenly grace some good relief you send submit you to high providence and ever in your noble heart prepense that all the sorrow in the world is less then virtues might and value's confidence for who nill bide the burden of distress must not here think to live for life is wretchedness therefore fair sir do comfort to you take and freely read what wicked felon so hath outraged you and thralled your gentle make perhaps this hand may help to ease your woe and wreak your sorrow on your cruel foe and lest it fair endeavour will apply those feeling words so near the quick did go that up his head he reared easily and leaning on his elbow these few words let fly what boots it plain that cannot be redressed and sow vain sorrow in a fruilesse care sith pour of hand nor skill of learned breast ne worldly price cannot redeem my deer out of her thraldom and continual fear for he the tyrant which her hath in ward by strong enchantments and black magic lere hath in a dungeon deep her close embarred and many dreadful fiends hath pointed to her guard there he torments her most terribly and day and night afflicts with mortal pain because to yield him love she does deny once to me yielded not to be yielded again but yet by torture he would her constrain love to conceive in her disdainful breast till so she do she must in dole remain ne may by living means be thence released what boots it then to plain that cannot be redressed with this sad rehearsal of his heavy stress the warlike damosel was impassioned soar and said sir knight your cause is nothing less then is your sorrow certes if not more for nothing so much pity does implore as gentle ladies helpless misery but yet if please you listen to my lore i will with proof of last extremity deliver her from thence or with her for you die ah gentlest knight alive said scudamore what huge heroic magnanimity dwells in thy bounteous breast what couldst thou more if she were thine and thou as now am i o spare thy happy days and them apply to better boot but let me die that ought more is more loss one is enough to die life is not lost said she for which is bought endless renown that more then death is to be sought thus she at length persuaded him to rise and with her weened to see what new success mote him befall upon new enterprise his arms which he had vowed to disprofess she gathered up and did about him dress and his for wandered steed unto him god so forth they both yfere

mars to learn his wanton plays how oft for venus and how often eke for many other nymphs he soar did shriek with womanish tears and with unwarlike smarts privily moistening his horrid cheek there was he painted full of burning darts and many wide wounds launched through his inner parts ne did he spare so cruel was the elf his own deer mother ah why should he so ne did he spare sometime to prick himself that he might taste the sweet consuming woe which he had wrought to many others more but to declare the mournful trage dies and spoils wherewith he all the ground did strow more eath to number

without respect of person or of port to show dan cupids pour and great effort and round about a border was entrailed of broken bows and arrows shivered short and a long bloody river through them railed so lively and so like that living sense it failed and at the upper end of that fair room there was and altar built of precious stone of passing value and of great renown on which there stood and image all alone of massy gold which with his own light shone and wings it had with sundry colours dight more sundry colours then the proud pauone bears in his boasted fan or iris bright when her discoloured bow she spreads through heaven bright blindfold he was and in his cruel fist a mortal bow and arrows keen did hold with which he shot at random when him list some headed with sad led some

what so were therein or writ or meant she was no whit thereby discouraged from prosecuting of her first intent but forward with bold steps into the next room went much fairer then the former was that room and richlier by many parts arrayed for not with arras made in painful loom but with pure gold it all was overlaid wrought with wild antics which their follies played in the rich metal as they living were a thousand monstrous forms therein were made such as false love does oft upon him wear for love in thousand monstrous forms does oft appear and all about the glistering walls were hung with warlike spoils and with victorious prays of mighty conquerors and captains strong which were whilom captived in their days to cruel love and wrought their own decays their swords & spears were broke & hauberks rend and their proud girlands of triumphant bays trodden in dust with fury insolent to show the victor's might and merciless intent the warlike maid beholding earnestly the goodly ordinance of this rich place did greatly wonder ne could satisfy her greedy eyes with gazing a long space but more she marveled that no footing's trace nor wight appeared but wasteful emptiness and solemn silence over all that place strange thing it seemed that none was to possess so rich purveyance ne them keep with carefulness and as she looked about she did behold how over that same door was likewise writ be bold be bold and every where be bold that much she mused yet could not construe it by any riddling skill or commune wit at last she spied at that rooms upper end another iron door on which was writ be not too bold whereto though she did bend her earnest mind yet wist not what it might intend thus she there waited until eventide yet living creature none she saw appear and now sad shadows gan the world to hide from mortal view and wrap in darkness drear yet nould she doff her weary arms for fear of secret danger ne let sleep oppress her heavy eyes with nature's burden deer but

trumpet found aloud sign of nigh battle or god victory nought therewith daunted was her courage proud but rather stirred to cruel enmity expecting cuer when some foe she might descry with that and hideous storm of wind arose with dreadful thunder and lightning atwixt and and earthquake as if it straight would loose the world's foundations from his centre fixed a direful stench of smoke and sulphur mixed ensued whose noyance filled the fearful stead from the fourth hour of night until the sixt yet the bold britonesse was nought dreaded though much immoved but steadfast still persevered all suddenly a stormy whirlwind blew throughout the house that clapped every door with which that iron wicket open flew as it with mighty levers had be tore and forth issued as on the ready flore of some theatre a graven personage that in his hand a branch of laurel boar with comely haviour and countenance sage clad in costly garments fit for tragic stage proceeding to the midst he still did stand as if in mind he somewhat had to say and to the vulgar beckoning with his hand in sign of silence as to hear a play by lively actions he gan bewray some argument of matter passioned which done he back retired soft away and passing by his name discovered ease on his robe in golden letters cyphered the noble maid still standing all this viewed and marveled at his strange intendiment with that

marched a jolly company in manner of a mask enranged orderly the while a most delicious harmony in full strange notes was sweetly herd to found that the rare sweetness of the melody the feeble senses wholly did confound and the frail soul in deep delight nigh drowned and when it ceased shrill trumpets loud did bray that their report did far away rebound and when they ceased it gan again to play the while the maskers marched forth in trim array the first was fancy like a lovely boy of rare aspect and beauty without pear matchable either to that imp of troy whom ioue did love and chosen his cup to bear or that same dainty lad which was so deer to great alcides that when as he died he wailed womanlike with many a tear and every wood and every valley wide he filled with hylas name the nymphs eke hylas cried his garment neither was of silk nor say but painted plumes in goodly order dight like as the sunburnt indians do array their tawny bodies in their proudest plighted as those same plumes so seemed he vain and light that by his gate might easily appear for still he fared as dancing in delight and in his hand a windy fan did bear that in the idle air he moved still here and there and him beside marched amorous desire who seemed of riper years then th'other swain yet was that others swain this elders sire and gave him being commune to them twaine his garment was disguised very vain and his embroidered bonnet sat awry betwixt both his hands few sparks he close did strain which still he blew and kindled busily that soon they life conceived & forth in flames did fly next after him went doubt who was clad in a discoloured coat of strange disguise that at his back a broad capuccio had and sleeves dependant albanese-wyse he looked askew with his mistrustful eyes and nicely trodden as thorns lay in his way or that the flore to shrink he did avise and on a broken reed he still did stay his feeble steps which shrunk when hard theron he lay with him went danger cloth

was this mischief that mishap with th'one his foes he threatened to invade with th'other he his friends meant to enwrap for whom he could not kill he practiced to entrap next him was fear all armed from top to toe yet thought himself not safe enough thereby but feared each shadow moving to and from and his own arms when glittering he did spy or clashing herd he fast away did fly as ashes pale of hew and wingy-heeled and evermore on danger fixed his eye gainst whom he always bent a brazen shield which his right hand unarmed fearfully did wield with him went hope in rank a handsome maid of cheerful look and lovely to behold in silken samite she was light arrayed and her fair locks were woven up in gold she always smiled and in her hand did hold and holy water sprinkle dipped in dew with which she sprinkled favours manifold on whom she list and did great liking show great liking unto many but true love to few and after them dissemblance and suspect marched in one rank yet and unequal pair for she was gentle and of mild aspect courteous to all and seeming debonair goodly adorned and exceeding fair yet was that all but painted and purloined and her bright brows were decked with borrowed hair her deeds were forged and her words false coined and always in her hand two clew's of silk she twined but he was foul ill favoured and grim under his eyebrows looking still askance and ever as dissemblance laughed on him he lowered on her with dangerous eye-glance showing his nature in his countenance his rolling eyes did never rest in place but walked each where for fear of hid mischance holding a lattice still before his face through which he still did peep as forward he did pace next him went grief and fury matched yfere grief all in sable sorrowfully clad down hanging his dull head with heavy cheer yet inly being more then seeming sad a pair of pincers in his hand he had with which he pinched people to the heart that from thenceforth a wretched life they led in wilful languor and consuming smart dying each day with inward wounds of dolours dart but fury was full ill appareled in rags that naked nigh she did appear with ghastly looks and dreadful drearihood for from her back her garments she did tear and from her head oft rend her snarled hear in her right hand a firebrand she did toss about her head still roaming here and there as a dismayed dear in chase embossed forgetful of his safety hath his right way lost after them went displeasure and pleasance he looking lumpish and full sullen sad and hanging down his heavy countenance she cheerful fresh and full of joyance glad as if no sorrow she ne felt ne dread that evil matched pair they seemed to be and angry wasp th'one in a vial had th'other in hers and honey-lady be thus marched these sixe couples forth in fair degree after all these there marched a most fair dame led of two greasy villains th'one despite the other cleped cruelty by name she doleful lady like a dreary spright called by strong charms out of eternal night had deaths own image figured in her face full of sad signs fearful to living sighed yet in that horror showed a seemly grace and with her feeble feet did move a comely pace her breast all naked as net ivory without adorn of gold or silver bright wherewith the craftsman wonts it beautify of her due honour was despoiled quite and a wide wound therein oh rueful sighed entrenched deep with knife accursed keen yet freshly bleeding forth her fainting spright the work of cruel hand was to be seen that died in sanguine read her skin all snowy clean at that wide orisice her trembling heart was drawn forth and in silver basin laid quite through transfixed with a deadly dart and in her blood yet steeming fresh embayed and those two villains which her steps upstaid when her weak feet could scarcely her sustain and fading vital powers gan to fade her forward still with torture did constrain and evermore increased her consuming pain next after her the winged god himself came riding on a lion ravenous taught to obey the manage of that elf that man and beast with pour imperious subueth to his knigdome tyrannous his blindfold eyes he bade a while unbind that his proud spoil of that same dolorous fair dame he might behold in perfect kind which seen he much rejoiced in his cruel mind of which full proud himself up rearing high he looked round about with stern disdain and did survey his goodly company and marshalling the evil ordered train with that the darts which his right did strain full dreadfully he shook that all did quake and clapped on high his coloured wings twaine that all his many it afraid did make though blinding him again his way he forth did take behind him was reproach repentance shame reproach the first shame next repent behind repentance feeble sorrowful and lame reproach despiteful careless and unkind shame most ill favoured bestial and blind shame lowered repentance sighed reproach did scold reproach sharp stings repentance whips entwined shame burning brandirons in her hand did hold all three to each unlike yet all made in one mould and after them a rude confused rout of persons flocked whose names is hard to read amongst them was stern strife and anger stout unquiet care and found unthriftihood lewd loss of time and sorrow seeming dead inconstant change and false disloyalty consuming riotise and guilty dread of heavenly vengeance faint infirmity vile poverty and lastly death with infamy there were full many more like maladies whose names and nature's i note readen well so many more as there be fantasies in wavering women's wit that none can tell or pains in love or punishments in hell and which disguised marched in masking wise about the chamber with that damosel and then returned having marched thrice into the inner room from whence they first did rise so soon as they were in the door straight way fast locked driven with that stormy blast which first it opened and boar all away then the brave maid which all this while was placed in secret shade and saw both first and last issued forth and went unto the door to enter in but found it locked fast it vain she thought with rigorous uproar for to efforce when charms had closed it afore where force might not avail their sleights and art she cast to use both fit for hard emprise for thy from that same room not to depart till morrow next she did her self avise when that same mask again should forth arise the morrow next appeared with joyous cheer calling men to their daily exercise then she as morrow fresh her self did rear out of her secret stand that day for to out wear all that day she outwore in wandering and gazing on that chambers ornament till that again the second evening her covered with her sable vestiment wherewith the world's fair beauty she hath blended then when the second watch was almost past that brazen door flew open and in went bold britomart as she had late forecast neither of idle shows nor of false charms aghast so soon as she was entered round about she cast her eyes to see what was become of all those persons which she saw without but lo they straight were vanished all and some ne living wight she saw in all that room save that same woeful lady both whose hands were bounden fast that did her ill become and her small waste girded round with iron bans unto a brazen pillar by the which she stands and her before the vile enchanter sat figuring strange characters of his art with living blood he those characters wrote dreadfully dropping from her dying heart seeming transfixed with a cruel dart and all perforce to make her him to love ah who can love the worker of her smart a thousand charms he formerly did prove yet thousand charms could not her steadfast heart remove soon as that virgin knight he saw in place his wicked books in haste he overthrew not caring his long labours to deface and fiercely running to that lady true a murderous knife out of his pocket drew the which he thought for villainous despite in her tormented body to embrew but the stout damosel to him leaping light his cursed hand withheld and mastered his might from her to whom his fury first he meant the wicked weapon rashly he did wrest and turning to her self his fell intent unwares it struck into her snowy chest that little drops empurpled her fair breast exceeding wroth therewith the virgin grew albe the wound were nothing deep impressed and fiercely forth her mortal blade she drew to give him the reward for such vile outrage due so mightily she smote him that to ground he fell half dead next stroke him should have slain had not the lady which by him stood bound dernly unto him called to abstain from doing him to die for else her pain should be remediless sith none but he which wrought it could the same recure again therewith she stayed her hand loath stayed to be for life she him envied and longed revenge to see and to him said thou wicked man whose meed for so huge mischief and vile villainy is death or if that ought do death exceed be sure that nought may save thee from to die but if that thou this dame do presently restore unto her health and former state this do and line else die undoubtedly he glad of life that looked for death but late did yield himself right willing to prolong his date and rising up gan straight to overlook those cursed leaves his charms back to reverse full dreadful things out of that baleful book he read and measured many a sad verse that horror gan the virgins heart to pierce and her fair locks up stared stiff on end hearing him those same bloody lines rehearse and all the while he read she did extend her sword high over him if ought he did offend anon she gan perceive the house to quake and all the doors to rattle round about yet all that did not her dismayed make nor slack her threatfully hand for dangers doubt but still with steadfast eye and courage stout abided to weet what end would come of all at last that mighty chain which round about her tender waste was wound adown gan fallen and that great brazen pillar broke in pieces small the cruel steel which thrilled her dying heart fell softly forth as of his own accord and the wide wound which lately did dispart her bleeding breast and riven bowels gored was closed up as it had not be bored and every part to safety full found as she were never hurt was soon restored though when she felt her self to be unbound and perfect hold prostrate she fell unto the ground before fair britomart she fell prostrate saying ah noble knight what worthy meed can wretched lady quit from woeful state yield you in lieu of this your gracious deed your virtue self her own reward shall breed even immortal praise and glory wide which i your vassal by your prowess freed shall through the world make to be notified and goodly well advance that goodly well was tried but britomart uprearing her from ground said gentle dame reward enough i ween for many labours more then i have found this that in safety now i have you seen and mean of your deliverance have been henceforth fair lady comfort to you take and put away remembrance of late teen in stead thereof know that your loving make hath no less grief endured for your gentle sake she much was cheered to hear him mentioned whom of all living wights she loved best then laid the noble championess strong hound upon th'enchaunter which had her distressed so soar and with foul outrages oppressed with that great chain wherewith not long xx he bound that piteous lady prisoner now released himself she bound more worthy to be so and captive with her led to wretchedness and woe returning back those goodly rooms which erst she saw so rich and royally arrayed now vanished utterly and clean subversed she found and all their glory quite decayed that sighed of such a change her much dismayed thence forth descending to that perilous porch those dreadful flames she also found delayed and quenched quite like a consumed torch that erst all enterers wont so cruelly to scorch more easy issue now then entrance late she found for now that feigned dreadful flame which choked the porch of that enchanted gate and passage barred to all that thither came was vanished quite as it were not the same and gave her leave at pleasure forth to pass th'enchaunter self which all that fraud did frame to have efforced the love of that fair lass seeing his work now wasted deep engrieved was but when the victoress arrived there where late she left the pensive scudamore with her own trusty squire both full of fear neither of them she found where she them lore there at her noble heart was astonished soar but most fair amoret whose gentle spright now gan to feed on hope which she before conceived had to see her own deer knight being thereof beguiled was filled with new affright but he sad man when he had long in dread awaited there for britomarts return yet saw her not nor sign of her good speed his expectation to despair did turn misdeeming sure that her those flames did burn and therefore gan advise with her old squire who her deer nurselings loss no less did mourn thence to depart for further aid t'enquire

she purpose made of love and otherwhiles of lustfulness that much she feared his mind would grow to some excess his will she feared for him she surely thought to be a man such as indeed he seemed and much the more by that he lately wrought when her from deadly thraldom he redeemed for which no service she too much esteemed yet dread of shame and doubt of fowl dishonour made her not yield so much as due she deemed yet britomart attended duly on her as well became a knight and did to her all honour it so befell one evening that they came unto a castle lodged there to be where many a knight and many a lovely dame was then assembled deeds of arms to see among all which was none more fair then she that many of them moved to eye her soar the custom of that place was such that he which had no love nor leman there in store should either win him one or lie without the door among the rest there was a jolly knight who being asked for his love avowed that fairest amoret was his by right and offered that to justify aloud the warlike virgin seeing his so proud and boastful challenge waxed inly wroth but for the present did her anger shroud and said her love to loose she was full loath but either he should neither of them have or both so forth they went and both together jousted but that same younker soon was overthrown and made repent that he had rashly lusted for thing unlawful that was not his own yet since he seemed valiant though unknown she that no less was courteous then stout cast how to salve that both the custom shown were kept and yet that knight not locked out that seemed full hard t'accord two things so far in doubt the seneschal was called to deem the right whom she required that first fair amoret might be to her allowed as to a knight that did her win and free from challenge set which straight to her was yielded without let then since that strange knights love from him was quit she claimed that to her self as ladies debt he as a knight might justly be admitted so none should be out shut sith all of loves were fitted with that her glistering helmet she unlaced which doffed her golden locks that were up bound still in a knot unto her heals down traced and like a silken veil in compass round about her back and all her body wound like as the shining sky in summer's night what time the days with scorching heat abound is crested all with lines of firy light that it prodigious seems in common peoples sighed such when those knights and ladies all about beheld her all were with amazement smit and every one gan grow in secret doubt of this and that according to each wit some thought that some enchantment feigned it some that bellona in that warlike wise to them appeared with shield and armour fit some that it was a mask of strange disguise so diversely each one did sundry doubts devise but that young knight which through her gentle deed was to that goodly fellowship restored ten thousand thanks did yield her for her meed and doubly overcomen her adored so did they all their former strife accord and eke fair amoret now freed from fear more frank affection did to her afford and to her bed which she was wont forbear now freely drew and found right safe assurance there where all that night they of their loves did treat and hard adventures betwixt themselves alone that each the other gan with passion great and griefful pity privately bemoan the morrow next so soon as titan shone they both uprose and to their ways them dight long wandered they yet never met with none that to their wills could them direct aright or to them tidings tell that mote their hearts delight lo thus they road till at the last they spied two armed knights that towards them did pace and each of them had riding by his side a lady seeming in so far a space but ladies none they were albe in face and outward show fair semblance they did bear for under mask of beauty and good grace vile treason and fowl falsehood hidden were that mote to none but to the wary wise appear the one of them the false duessa hight that now had changed her former wonted hew for she could don so many shapes in sighed as ever could chameleon colours new so could she forge all colours save the true the other no whit better was then she but that such as she was she plain did show yet otherwise much worse if worse might be and daily more offensive unto each degree her name was ate mother of debate and all dissension which does daily grow among frail men that many a public state and many a private oft does overthrow her false duessa who full well did know to be most fit to trouble noble knights which hunt for honour raised from below out of the dwellings of the damned sprights where she in darkness wastes her cursed days & nights hard by the gates of hell her dwelling is there whereas all the plagues and harms abound which punish wicked men that walk amiss it is a darksome delve far under ground with thorns and barren brakes environed round that none the same may easily out win yet many ways to enter may be found but none to issue forth when one is in for discord harder is to end then to begin and all within the riven walls were hung with ragged monuments of times forepast all which the sad effects of discord sung there were rend robes and broken sceptres placed altars defiled and holy things defaced dishivered spears and shields torn in twaine great cities ransacked and strong castles razed nations captived and huge armies slain of all which ruins there some relics did remain there was the sign of antique babylon of fatal thebes of room that reigned long of sacred salem and sad ilion for memory of which on high there hung the golden apple cause of all their wrong for which the three fair goddesses did strive there also was the name of nimrod strong of alexander and his princes fiue which shared to them the spoils that he had god alive and there the relics of the drunken fray the which among the lapithees befell and of the bloody feast which sent away so many centaur's drunken souls to hell that under great alcides fury fell and of the dreadful discord which did driven the noble argonauts to outrage fell that each of life sought others to deprive all mindless of the golden fleece which made them strive and eke of private persons many more that were too long a work to count them all some of sworn friends that did their faith forgo some of born brothers proved unnatural some of deer lovers foes perpetual witness their broken bands there to be seen their girlands rend their bowers despoiled all the monuments whereof there biding been as plain as at the first when they were fresh and green such was her house within but all without the barren ground was full of wicked weeds which she her self had sown all about now grown great at first of little seeds the seeds of evil words and factious deeds which when to ripeness due they grown are bring forth and infinite increase that breeds tumultuous trouble and contentious jar the which most often end in bloodshed and in war and those same cursed seeds do also serve to her for bred and yield her living food for life it is to her when others starve through mischievous debate and deadly feud that she may suck their life and drink their blood with which she from her childhood had be fed for she at first was born of hellish brood and by infernal furies nourished that by her monstrous shape might easily be read her face most fowl and filthy was to see with squinted eyes contrary ways intended and loathly mouth unmeet a mouth to be that nought but gall and venom comprehended and wicked words that god and man offended her lying tongue was in two parts divided and both the parts did speak and both contended and as her tongue so was her heart decided that never thought one thing but doubly still was guided also as she double spoke so herd she double with matchless ears deformed and distorted filled with false rumours and seditios trouble bred in assemblies of the vulgar sort that still are led with every light report and as her ears so eke her feet were odd and much unlike th'one long the other short and both misplaced that when th'one forward yode the other back retired and contrary trodden likewise unequal were her hands twaine that one did reach the other pushed away that one did make the other marred again and sought to bring all things unto decay whereby great riches gathered many a day she in short space did often bring to nought and their possessors often did dismay for all her study was and all her thought how she might overthrow the things that concord wrought so much her malice did her might surpass that even almighty self she did malign because to man so merciful he was and unto all his creatures so benign sith she her self was of his grace indign for all this world's fair workmanship she tried unto his last confusion to bring and that great golden chain quite to divide with which it blessed concord hath together tide such was that hag which with duessa road and serving her in her malicious use to hurt good knights was as it were her bawd to fell her borrowed beauty to abuse for though like withered tree that wants juice she old and crooked were yet now of late as fresh and fragrant as the flower deluce she was become by change of her estate and made full goodly joyance to her new found mate her mate he was a jolly youthful knight that boar great sway in arms and chivalry and was indeed a man of much might his name was blandamour that did descry his fickle mind full of inconstancy and now himself he fitted had right well with two companions of like quality faithless duessa and false paridell that whither were more false full hard it is to tell now when this gallant with his goodly crew from far espied the famous britomart like knight adventurous in outward view with his fair paragon his conquests part approaching nigh eftsoons his wanton heart was tickled with delight and jesting said lo there sir paridel for your desert good luck presents you with yond lovely maid for pity that you want a fellow for your aid by that the lovely pair drew nigh to hound whom when as paridel more plain beheld albe in heart he like affection found yet mindful how he late by one was felled that did those arms and that same scutcheon wielded he had small lust to buy his love so deer but answered sir him wise i never held that having once escaped peril near would afterwards afresh the sleeping evil rear this knight too late his manhood and his might i did assay that me right dearly cost ne list i for revenge provoke new fight ne for light ladies love that soon is lost the hotspur youth so scorning to be crossed take then to you this dame of mine quoth he and i without your peril or your cost will challenge yond same other for my fee so forth he fiercely pricked that one him scare could see the warlike britonesse her soon addressed and with such uncouth welcome did receive her feigned paramour her forced guest that being forced his saddle soon to leave him self he did of his new love deceive and made him self then sample of his folly which done she passed forth not taking leave and left him now as sad as whilom jolly well warned to beware with whom he dared to dally which when his other company beheld they to his succour ran with ready aid and finding him unable once to wielded they reared him on horse back and upstaid till on his way they had him forth conveyed and all the way with wondrous grief of mind and shame he showed him self to be dismayed more for the love which he had left behind then that which he had to sir paridel resigned natheless he forth did march well as he might and made good semblance to his company dissembling his disease and evil plighted till that ere long they chanced to espy two other knights that towards them did ply with speedy course as bent to charge them new whom when as blandamour approaching nigh perceived to be such as they seemed in view he was full woe and gan his former grief renew for th'one of them he perfectly descried to be sir scudamour by that he boar the god of love with wings displayed wide whom mortally he hated evermore both for his worth that all men did adore and eke because his love he won by right which when he thought it grieved him full soar that through the bruises of his former fight he now unable was to wreak his old despite for thy he thus to paridel bespoke fair sir offriendship let me now you pray that as i late adventured for your sake the hurts whereof me now from battle stay you will me now with like good turn repay and justify my cause on yonder knight ah sir said paridel do not dismay your self for this my self will for you fight as you have done for me the left hand rubs the right with that he put his spurs unto his steed with spear in rest and towards him did fare like shaft out of a bow preventing speed but scudamour was shortly well aware of his approach and gan him self prepare him to receive with entertainment meet so furiously they met that either bore the other down under their horses feet that what of them became themselves did scarcely weet as when two billows in the irish sounds forcibly driven with contrary tides do meet together each aback rebounds with roaring rage and dashing on all sides that fills all the sea with some divides the doubtful current into diverse ways so fell those two in spite of both their prides but scudamour himself did soon upraise and mounting light his foe for lying long upbraids who rolled on and heap lay still in swoon all careless of his taunt and bitter rail till that the rest him seeing lie on ground ran hastily to weet what did him ail where finding that the breath gan him to fail with busy care they strove him to awake and doffed his helmet and undid his mail so much they did that at the last they brake his slumber yet so mazed that he nothing spoke which when as blandamour beheld he said false faitour scudamour that hast by slight and foul advantage this good knight dismayed a knight much better then thy self behight well falls it thee that i am not in plighted this day to wreak the damage by thee done such is thy wont that still when any knight is weakened then thou dost him overrun so hast thou to thy self false honour often won he little answered but in manly heart his mighty indignation did forbear which was not yet so secret but some part thereof did in his frowning face appear like as a gloomy cloud the which does bear and hideous storm is by the northern blast quite overblown yet does not pass so clear but that it all the sky does overcast with darkness dreaded and threatens all the world to wast ah gentle knight then false duessa said why do you strive for ladies love so soar whose chief desire is love and friendly aid amongst gentle knights to nourish evermore ne be you wroth sir scudamour therefore that she your love list love another knight ne do your self dislike a whit the more for love is free and led with self delight ne will inforced be with masterdom or might so false duessa but vile ate thus both foolish knights i can but laugh at both that strive and storm with stir outrageous for her that each of you alike does loath and loves another with whom now she goes in lovely wise and sleeps and sports and plays whilst both you here with many a cursed oath swear she is yours and stir up bloody frays to win a willow bough whilst other wears the bays vile hag said scudamour why dost thou lie and falsely seekest a virtuous wight to shame found knight said she the thing that with this eye i saw why should i doubt to tell the same then tell quoth blandamour and fear no blame tell what thou sawest maugre who so it hears i saw quoth she a stranger knight whose name i wot not well but in his shield he bears that well i wot the heads of many broken spears i saw him have your amoret at will i saw him kiss i saw him her embrace i saw him sleep with her all night his fill all many nights and many by in place that present were to testify the case which when as scudamour did hear his heart was thrilled with inward grief as when in chase the parthian strikes a stag with shivering dart the beast astonished stands in midst of his smart so stood sir scudamour when this he herd ne word he had to speak for great dismay but looked on glauce grim who wox afeard of outrage for the words which she herd say albe untrue she wist them by assay but blandamour whenas he did espy his change of cheer that anguish did bewray he wox full blithe as he had god thereby and gan thereat to triumph without victory lo recreant said he the fruitless end of thy vain boast and spoil of love misgotten whereby the name of knighthood thou dost shend and all true lovers with dishonour blotted all things not rooted well will soon be rotten fie fie false knight then false duessa cried unworthy life that love with guile hast got be thou where ever thou do go or ride loathed of ladies all and of all knights defied but scudamour for passing great despite stayed not to answer scarcely did refrain but that in all those knights and ladies sighed he for revenge had guiltless glauce slain but being passed he thus began amain false traitor squire false squire of falsest knight why does mine hand from thine avenge abstain whose lord hath done my love this soul despite why do i not it wreak on thee now in my might discourteous disloyal britomart untrue to god and unto man unjust what vengeance due can equal thy desert that hast with shameful spot of sinful lust defiled the pledge committed to thy trust let ugly shame and endless infamy colour thy name with foul reproaches rust yet thou false squire his fault shalt deer aby and with thy punishment his penance shalt supply the aged dame him seeing so enraged was dead with fear natheless as need required his flaming fury sought to have assuaged with sober words that sufferance desired till time the trial of her truth expired and evermore sought britomart to clear but he the more with furious rage was fired and thrice his hand to kill her did uprear and thrice he drew it back so did at last forbear cant. ii blandamour wins false florimell paridell for her strives they are accorded agape does lengthen her sons lives firebrand of hell first tined in phlegeton by thousand furies and from thence out thrown into this world to work confusion and set it all on fire by force unknown is wicked discord whose small sparks once blown none but a god or godlike man can slake such as was orpheus that when strife was grown among those famous imps of greece did take his silver harp in hand and shortly friends them make or such as that celestial psalmist was that when the wicked fiend his lord tormented with heavenly notes that did all other pass the outrage of his furious fit relented such music is wise words with time consented to moderate stiff minds disposed to strive such as that prudent roman well invented what time his people into parts did ruie them reconciled again and to their homes did driven such used wise glauce to that wrathful knight to calm the tempest of his troubled thought yet blandamour with terms of foul despite and paridell her scorned and set at nought as old and crooked and not good for ought both they unwise and wareless of the evil that by themselves unto themselves is wrought through that false witch and that foul aged drevil the one a fiend the other and incarnate devil with whom as they thus road accompanied they were encountered of a lusty knight that had a goodly lady by his side to whom he made great dalliance and delight it was to weet the bold sir ferraugh hight he that from braggadocchio whilom reft the snowy florimell whose beauty bright made him seem happy for so glorious theft yet was it in due trial but a wandering wove which when as blandamour whose fancy light was always flitting as the wavering wind after each beauty that appeared in sighed beheld eft soon it pricked his wanton mind with sting of lust that reasons eye did blind that to sir paridell these words he sent sir knight why ride you dumpish thus behind since so good fortune does to you present so fair a spoil to make you joyous merriment but paridell that had too late a trial of the bad issue of his counsel vain list not to hark but made this fair denial last turn was mine well proved to my pain this now be yours god send you better gain whose scoffed words he taking half in scorn fiercely forth pricked his steed as in disdain against that knight ere he him well could torn by means whereof he hath him lightly overborn who with the sudden stroke astonished soar upon the ground a while in slumber lay the while his love away the other boar and showing her did paridell upbray lo sluggish knight the victor's happy prey so fortune friends the bold whom paridell seeing so fair indeed as he did say his heart with secret envy gan to swell and inly grudge at him that he had sped so well natheless proud man himself the other deemed having so peerless paragon got for sure the fairest florimell him seemed to him was fallen for his happy lot whose like alive on earth he weened not therefore he her did court did serve did woo with humblest suit that he imagine mote and all things did devise and all things do that might her love prepare and liking win thereto she in regard thereof him recompensed with golden words and goodly countenance and such found favours sparingly dispensed sometime him blessing with alight eye-glance and coy looks tempering with lose dalliance sometime estranging him in sterner wise that having cast him in a foolish trance he seemed brought to bed in paradise and proved himself most fool in what he seemed most wise so great a mistress of her art she was and perfectly practised in woman's craft that though therein himself he thought to pass and by his false allurements wily draft had thousand women of their love bereft yet now he was surprised for that false spright which that same witch had in this form engrafted was so expert in every subtle slight that it could overreach the wisest earthly wight yet he to her did daily service more and daily more deceived was thereby yet paridell him envied therefore as seeming placed in sole felicity so blind is lust false colours to descry but ate soon discovering his desire and finding now fit opportunity to stir up strife betwixt love and spite and ire did privily put coals unto his secret fire by sundry means thereto she pricked him forth now with remembrance of those spiteful speeches now with opinion of his own more worth now with recounting of like former breaches made in their friendship as that hag him teaches and ever when his passion is allayed she it revives and new occasion reaches that on a time as they together weighed he made him open challenge and thus boldly said too boastful blandamour too long i bear the open wrongs thou dost me day by day well knowest thou when we friendship first did swear the covenant was that every spoil or prey should equally be shared betwixt us tway where is my part then of this lady bright whom to thy self thou takest quite away render therefore therein to me my right or answer for thy wrong as shall fallen out in fight exceeding wroth thereat was blandamour and gan this bitter answer to him make too foolish paridell that fairest flower wouldst gather feign and yet no pains wouldst take but not so easy will i her forsake this hand her won this hand shall her defend with that they gan their shivering spears to shake and deadly points at either's breast to bend forgetful each to have be ever others friend their firy steeds with so untamed force did bear them both to fell avenge's end that both their spears with pitiless remorse through shield and mail and habergeon did weened and in their flesh a grisly passage rend that with the fury of their own affret each other horse and man to ground did send where lying still a while both did forget the perilous present stound in which their lives were set as when two warlike brigandines at sea with murderous weapons armed to cruel fight do meet together on the watery lea they stem each other with so fell despite that with the shock of their own heedless might their wooden ribs are shaken nigh a sunder they which from shore behold the dreadful sighed of flashing fire and hear the ordnance thunder do greatly stand amazed at such unwonted wonder at length they both upstarted in amaze as men awaked rashly out of dream and round about themselves a while did gaze till seeing her that florimell did seem in doubt to whom she victory should deem therewith their dulled sprights they edged a new and drawing both their swords with rage extreme like two mad mastiffs each on other flew and shields did share & mails did rash and helms did hew so furiously each other did assail as if their souls they would atonce have rend out of their breasts that streams of blood did rail adown as if their springs of life were spent that all the ground with purple blood was sprented and all their armours stained with bloody gore yet scarcely once to breath would they relent so mortal was their malice and so soar become of feigned friendship which they vowed afore and that which is for ladies most befitting to stint all strife and foster friendly peace was from those dams so far and so unfitting as that in stead of praying them surcease they did much more their cruelty increase bidding them fight for honour of their love and rather die then ladies cause release with which vain terms so much they did them move that both resolved the last extremities to prove there they i ween would fight until this day had not a squire even he the squire of dams by great adventure traveled that way who seeing both bent to so bloody games and both of old well knowing by their names drew nigh to weet the cause of their debate and first laid on those ladies thousand blames that did not fseke t'appease their deadly hate but gazed on their harms not pitying their estate and then those knights he humbly did beseech to stay their hands till he a while had spoken who looked a little up at that his speech yet would not let their battle so be broken both greedy fierce on other to be wrought yet he to them so earnestly did call and them conjured by some well known token that they at last their wrathful hands let fallen content to hear him speak and glad to rest withal first he desired their cause of strife to see they said it was for love of florimell ah gentle knights quoth he how may that be and she so far astray as none can tell found squire full angry then said paridell seest not the lady there before thy face he looked back and her advising well weened as he said by that her outward grace that fairest florimell was present there in place glad man was he to see that joyous sighed for none alive but joyed in florimell and lowly to her louting thus behight fairest of fair that fairness dost excel this happy day i have to greet you well in which you safe i see whom thousand late misdoubted lost through mischief that befell long may you live in health and happy state she little answered him but lightly did aggrate then turning to those knights he gan a new and you sir blandamour and paridell that for this lady present in your view have raised this cruel war and outrage fell certes me seems be not advised well but rather ought in friendship for her sake to join your force their forces to repel that seek perforce her from you both to take and of your got spoil their own triumph to make thereat sir blandamour with countenance stern all full of wrath thus fiercely him bespoke a read thou squire that i the man may learn that dare from me think florimell to take not one quoth he but many do partake herein as thus it lately so befell that satyran a girdle did uptake well known to appertain to florimell which for her sake he wore as him beseemed well but when as she her self was lost and gone full many knights that loved her like deer thereat did greatly grudge that he alone that lost fair ladies ornament should wear and gan therefore close spite to him to bear which he to shun and stop vile envies sting hath lately caused to be proclaimed each where a solemn feast with public turneying to which all knights with them their ladies are to bring and of them all she that is fairest found shall have that golden girdle for reward and of those knights who is most stout on ground shall to that fairest lady be preferred since therefore she her self is now your ward to you that ornament of hers pertains against all those that challenge it to guard and save her honour with your venturous pains that shall you win more glory then you here find gains when they the reason of his words had heard they gan abate the rancour of their rage and with their honours and their loves regard the furious flames of malice to assuage tho each to other did his faith engage like faithful friends thenceforth to join in one with all their force and battle strong to wage gainst all those knights as their professed foes that challenged ought in florimell save they alone so well accorded forth they road together in friendly sort that lasted but a while and of all old dislikes they made fair weather yet all was forged and spread with golden foil that under it hid hate and hollow guile ne certes can that friendship long endure how ever gay and goodly be the style that does ill cause or evil end enure for virtue is the band that binds hearts most sure thus as they marched all in close disguise of feigned love they chanced to overtake two knights that linked road in lovely wise as if they secret counsels did partake and each not far behind him had his make to weet two ladies of most goodly hew that betwixt themselves did gentle purpose make unmindful both of that discordful crew the which with speedy pace did after them pursue who as they now approached nigh at hand deeming them doughty as they did appear they sent that squire afore to understand what mote they be who viewing them more near returned ready news that those same wear two of the prowest knights in fairy land and those two ladies their two lovers deer courageous cambell and stout triamond with canacee and cambine linked in lovely bound whilom as antique stories tellen us those two were foes the felonest on ground and battle made the dreadest dangerous that ever shrilling trumpet did resound though now their acts be not where to be found as that renowned poet them compiled with warlike numbers and heroic found dan chaucer well of english undefiled on fame's eternal beadroll worthy to be filed but wicked time that all good thoughts does waste and works of noblest wits to nought out wear that famous monument hath quite defaced and robbed the world of treasure endless deer the which mote have enriched all us hear o cursed eld the cankerworm of writs how may these rhymes so rude as does appear hope to endure sith works of heavenly wits are quite devoured and brought to nought by little bits then pardon oh most sacred happy spirit that i thy labours lost may thus revive and steal from thee the meed of thy due merit that none durst ever whilst thou wast alive and being dead in vain yet many strive ne dare i like but through infusion sweet of thine own spirit which does in me survive i follow here the footing of thy feet that with thy meaning so i may the rather meet cambelloes sister was fair canacee that was the learnedest lady in her days well seen in every science that mote be and every secret work of nature's ways in witty riddles and in wise soothsays in power of herbs and tunes of beasts and birds and that augmented all her other praise she modest was in all her deeds and words and wondrous chaste of life yet loved of knights & lords full many lords and many knights her loved yet she to none of them her liking lent ne ever was with found affection moved but ruled her thoughts with goodly government for dread of blame and honours blemishment and eke unto her looks a law she made that none of them once out of order went but like to wary sentinels well stayed still watched on every side of secret foes afraid so much die more as she refused to love so much the more she loved was and sought that oftentimes unquiet strife did move among her lovers and great quarrels wrought that oft for her in bloody arms they fought which whenas cambell that was stout and wise perceived would breed great mischief he bethought how to prevent the peril that mote rise and turn both him and her to honour in this wise one day when all that troop of warlike wooers assembled were to weet whose she should be all mighty men and dreadful derring doers the harder it to make them well agree among them all this end he did decree that of them all which love to her did make they by consent should chosen the stoutest three that with himself should combat for her sake and of them all the victor should his sister take bold was the challenge as himself was bold and courage full of haughty hardiment approved oft in perils manifold which he achieved to his great ornament but yet his sisters skill unto him lent most confidence and hope of happy speed conceived by a ring which she him sent that amongst the many virtues which we reed had power to staunch all wounds that mortally did bleed well was that rings great virtue known to all that dread thereof and his redoubted might did all that youthly rout so much appall that none of them durst undertake the fight more wise they weened to make of love delight then life to hazard for fair ladies look and yet uncertain by such outward sighed though for her sake they all that peril took whither she would them love or in her liking brook among those knights there were three brothers bold three bolder brothers never were born born of one mother in one happy mould born at one burden in one happy morn thrice happy mother and thrice happy morn that boar three such three such not to be found her name was agape whose children weren all three as one the first hight priamond the second diamond the youngest triamond stout priamond but not so strong to strike strong diamond but not so stout a knight but triamond was stout and strong alike on horseback used triamond to fight and priamond on foot had more delight but horse and foot knew diamond to wield with curtaxe used diamond to smite and triamond to handle spear and shield but spear and curtaxe both used priamond in field these three did love each other dearly well and with so firm affection were allied as if but one soul in them all did dwell which did her pour into three parts divide like three fair branches budding far and wide that from one root derived their vital sap and like that root that does her life divide their mother was and had full blessed hap these three so noble babes to bring forth at one clap their mother was a faith and had the skill of secret things and all the powers of nature which she by art could use unto her will and to her service bind each living creature through secret understanding of their feature thereto she was right fair when so her face she list discover and of goodly stature but she as fays are wont in privy place did spend her days and loved in forests wild to space there on a day a noble youthly knight seeking adventures in the salvage wood did by great fortune get of her the sighed as she sat careless by a crystal flood combing her golden locks as seemed her good and unawares upon her laying hold that strove in vain him long to have withstood oppressed her and there as it is told got these three lovely babes that proved three champions bold which she with her long fostered in that wood till that to ripeness of men state they grew then showing forth signs of their father's blood they loved arms and knighthood did ensue seeking adventures where they any knew which when their mother saw she gan to doubt their safety lest by searching dangers new and rash provoking perils all about their days mote be abridged through their courage stout therefore desirous th'end of all their days to know and them t'enlarge with long extent by wondrous skill and many hidden ways to the three fatal sisters house she went far under ground from tract of living went down in the bottom of the deep abyss where demogorgon in dull darkness penned far from the view of gods and heavens bliss the hideous chaos keeps their dreadful dwelling is there she them found all sitting round about the direful distaff standing in the mid and with unwearied fingers drawing out the lines of life from living knowledge hid sad clotho held the rock the while the thrid by grisly lachesis was spun with pain that cruel atropos eftsoons undid with cursed knife cutting the twist in twaine most wretched men whose days depend on thrids so vain she them saluting there by them sat still beholding how the thrids of life they span and when at last she had beheld her fill trembling in heart and looking pale and wan her cause of coming she to tell began to whom fierce atropos bold faith that durst come see the secret of the life of man well worthy thou to be of ioue accursed and eke thy children's thrids to be a sunder burst whereat she soar afraid yet her besought to grant her boon and rigour to abate that she might see her children's thrids forth brought and know the measure of their utmost date to them ordained by eternal fate which clotho granting showed her the same that when she saw it did her much amate to see their thrids so thin as spiders frame and eke so short that seemed their ends out shortly came she then began them humbly to entreat to draw them longer out and better twine that so their lives might be prolonged late but lachesis thereat gan to repine and said found dame that deemest of things divine as of humane that they may altered be and changed at pleasure for those imps of thine not so for what the fates do once decree not all the gods can change nor ioue him self can free then since quoth she the term of each men life for nought may lessened nor enlarged be grant this that when you shred with fatal knife his line which is the eldest of the three which is of them the shortest as i see eftsoons his life may pass into the next and when the next shall likewise ended be that both their lives may likewise be annexed unto the third that his may so be trebly waxed they granted it and then that careful faith departed thence with full contented mind and coming home in warlike fresh array them found all three according to their kind but unto them what destiny was assigned or how their lives were eked she did not tell but evermore when she fit time could find she warned them to tend their safeties well and love each other deer what ever them befell so did they surely during all their days and never discord did among them fallen which much augmented all their other praise and now increase affection natural in love of canacee they joined all upon which ground this same great battle grew great matter growing of beginning small the which for length i will not here pursue but rather will reserve it for a canto new cant. iii the battle betwixt three brothers with cambell for canacee cambina with true friendships bound does their long strife agree o why do wretched men so much desire to draw their days unto the utmost date and do not rather wish them soon expire knowing the misery of their estate and thousand perils which them still await tossing them like a boat amid the main that every hour they knock at deaths gate and he that happy seems and least in pain yet is as nigh his end as he that most does plain therefore this faith i hold but found and vain the which in seeking for her children three long life thereby did more prolong their pain yet whilst they lived none did euersee more happy creatures then they seemed to be nor more ennobled for their courtesy that made them dearly loved of each degree ne more renowned for their chivalry that made them dreaded much of all men far and nigh these three that hardy challenge took in hand for canacee with cambell for to fight the day was set that all might understand and pledges pawned the same to keep a right that day the dreadest day that living wight did ever see upon this world to shine so soon as heavens window showed light these warlike champions all in armour shine assembled were in field the challenge to define the field with lists was all about enclosed to bar the press of people far away and at th'one side sixe judges were disposed to view and deem the deeds of arms that day and on the other side in fresh array fair canacee upon a stately stage was set to see the fortnne of that fray and to be seen as his most worthy wage that could her purchase with his lives adventured gage then entered cambell first into the list with stately steps and fearless countenance as if the conquest his he surely wist soon after did the brothers three advance in brave array and goodly amenance with scutcheons gilded and banners broad displayed and marching thrice in warlike ordinance thrice louted lowly to the noble maid the while shrill trumpets & loud clarions sweetly played which done the doughty challenger came forth all armed to point his challenge to abet gainst whom sir priamond with equal worth and equal arms himself did forward set a trumpet blew they both together met with dreadful force and furious intent careless of peril in their fierce affret as if that life to loss they had forelent and cared not to spare that should be shortly spent right practic was sir priamond in fight and thoroughly skilled in use of shield and spear ne less approved was cambelloes might ne less his sill in weapons did appear that hard it was to ween which harder were full many mighty strokes on either side were sent that seemed death in them to bear but they were both so watchful and well eyed that they avoided were and vainly by did slide yet one of many was so strongly bent by priamond that with unlucky glance through cambels shoulder it unwarely went that forced him his shield to disadvance much was he grieved with that graceless chance yet from the wound no drop of blood there fell but wondrous pain that did the more enhance his haughty courage to avengement fell smart daunts not mighty hearts but makes them more to swell with that his poignant spear he fierce adventured with doubled force close underneath his shield that through the mails into his thigh it entered and there arresting ready way did yield for blood to gush forth on the grassy field that he for pain himself not right uprear but too and from in great amazement reeled like and old oak whose pith and sap is sear at puff of every storm does stagger here and there whom so dismayed when cambell had espied again he drove at him with double might that nought mote stay the steel till in his side the mortal point most cruelly empight where fast infixed whilst he sought by slight it forth to wrest the staff a sunder brake and left the head behind with which despite he all enraged his shivering spear did shake and charging him a fresh thus felly him bespoke lo faitour there thy meed unto thee take the meed of thy mischallenge and abet not for thine own but for thy sisters sake have i thus long thy life unto thee let but to forbear does not forgive the debt the wicked weapon herd his wrathful vow and passing forth with furious affret pierced through his beaver quite into his brow that with the force it backward forced him to bow therewith a sunder in the midst it braced and in his hand nought but the truncheon left the other half behind yet sticking fast out of his headpiece cambell fiercely rest and with such fury back at him it heaved that making way unto his dearest life his weasand pipe it through his gorget cleft thence streams of purple blood issuing rife let forth his weary ghost and made and end of strife his weary ghost assoiled from fleshly band did not as others wont directly fly unto her rest in plutoes grisly land ne into air did vanish presently ne changed was into a star in sky but through traduction was eftsoons derived like as his mother prayed the destiny into his other brothers that survived in whom he lived a new of former life deprived whom when on ground his brother next beheld though sad and sorry for so heavy sighed yet leave unto his sorrow did not yield but rather stirred to vengeance and despite through secret feeling of his generous spright rushed fiercely forth the battle to renew as in reversion of his brother's right and challenging the virgin as his due his foe was soon addressed the trumpets freshly blew with that they both together fiercely met as if that each meant other to devour and with their axes both so sorely bet that neither plate nor mail whereas their pour they felt could once sustain the hideous stour but rived were like rotten wood a sunder whilst through their rifts the ruddy blood did shower and fire did flash like lightning after thunder that filled the lookers on atonce with ruth and wonder as when two tigers pricked with hunger's rage have by good fortune found some beasts fresh spoil on which they ween their famine to assuage and gain a feastful guerdon of their toil both falling out do stir up strifeful broil and cruel battle betwixt themselves do make while neither lets the other touch the soil but either disdains with other to partake so cruelly these knights strove for that ladies sake full many strokes that mortally were meant the while were interchanged betwixt them two yet they were all with so good wariment or warded or avoided and let go that still the life stood fearless of her foe till diamond disdaining long delay of doubtful fortune wavering to and from resolved to end it one or other way and heaved his murderous axe at him with mighty sway the dreadful stroke in case it had arrived where it was meant so deadly it was meant the soul had sure out of his body rived and stinted all the strife incontinent but cambels fate that fortune did prevent for seeing it at hand he swerved aside and so gave way unto his fell intent who missing of the mark which he had eyed was with the force nigh felled while his right foot did slide as when a vulture greedy of his prey through hunger long that heart to him does lend strikes at and heron with all his bodies sway that from his force seems nought may it defend the wary fowl that spies him towards bend his dreadful souse avoids it shunning light and makes him his wing in vain to spend that with the weight of his own wieldless might he falls nigh to ground and scarce recovers flight which fair adventure when cambello spied full lightly ere himself he could recover from dangers dread to ward his naked side he can let driven at him with all his power and with his axe him smote in evil hour that from his shoulders quite his head he rest the headless trunk as heedless of that stower stood still a while and his fast footing kept till feeling life to fail it fell and deadly slept they which that piteous spectacle beheld were much amazed the headless trunk to see stand up so long and weapon vain to wielded unweeting of the fates divine decree for life's succession in those brothers three for notwithstanding that one soul was reft yet had the body not dismembered be it would have lived and revived eft but finding no fit seat the lifeless corpse it left it left but that same soul which therein dwelled straight entering into triamond him filled with double life and grief which when he felt as one whose inner parts had be thrilled with point of steel that close his heartblood spilled he lightly leapt out of his place of rest and rushing forth into the empty field against cambello fiercely him addressed who him affronting soon to fight was ready pressed well mote you wonder how that noble knight after he had so often wounded been could stand on foot now to renew the fight but had you then him forth advancing seen some newborn wight you would him surely ween so fresh he seemed and so fierce in sighed like as a snake whom weary winter's teen hath worn to nought now feeling summers might casts off his ragged skin and freshly does him dight all was through virtue of the ring he wore the which not only did not from him let one drop of blood to fallen but did restore his weakened powers and dulled spirits whet through working of the stone therein set else how could one of equal might with most against so many no less mighty met once think to match three such on equal cost three such as able were to match a puissant host yet nought thereof was triamond adread ne desperate of glorious victory but sharply him assailed and soar bestead with heaps of strokes which he at him let fly as thick as hail forth poured from the sky he stroke he soused he foined he hewed he lashed and did his iron brand so fast apply that from the same the fiery sparkles flashed as fast as water-sprinkles gainst a rock are dashed much was cambello daunted with his blows so thick they fell and forcibly were sent that he was forced from danger of the throws back to retire and somewhat to relent till th'heat of his fierce fury he had spent which when for want of breath gan to abate he then afresh with new encouragement did him assail and mightily amate as fast as forward erst now backward to retreat like as the tide that comes from ocean main flows up the shenan with contrary force and overruling him in his own rain drives back the current of his kindly course and makes it seem to have some other source but when the flood is spent then back again his borrowed waters forced to redisbourse he sends the sea his own with double gain and tribute eke withal as to his sovereign thus did the battle vary to and from with diverse fortune doubtful to be deemed now this the better had now had his foe then he half vanquished then the other seemed yet victor's both them selves always esteemed and all the while the disentrailed blood adown their sides like little rivers streamed that with the wasting of his vital flood sir triamond at last full faint and feeble stood but cambell still more strong and greater grew ne felt his blood to wast ne powers emperished through that rings virtue that with vigour new still when as he enfeebled was him cherished and all his wounds and all his bruises guarished like as a withered tree through husbands toil is often seen full freshly to have flourished and fruitful apples to have born awhile as fresh as when it first was planted in the soil through which advantage in his strength he rose and smote the other with so wondrous might that through die seam which did his hauberk close into his throat and life it pierced quite that down he fell as dead in all men's sighed yet dead he was not yet he sure did die as all men do that loose the living spright so did one soul out of his body fly unto her native home from mortal misery but natheless while all the lookers on him dead behight as he to all appeared all unawares he started up anon as one that had out of a dream be reared and fresh assailed his foe who half afeard of uncouth sighed as he some ghost had seen stood still amazed holding his idle sword till having often by him stricken been he forced was to strike and save him self from teen yet from thenceforth more warily he fought as one in fear the stygian gods t'offend ne followed on so fast but rather sought him self to save and danger to defend then life and labour both in vain to spend which triamond perceiving weened sure he gan to faint towards the battles end and that he should not long on foot endure a sign which did to him the victory assure whereof full blithe eftsoons his mighty hand he heaved on high in mind with that same blow to make and end of all that did withstand which cambell seeing come was nothing slow him self to save from that so deadly throw and at that instant reaching forth his sword close underneath his shield that scarce did show stroke him as he his hand to strike upreared in th'arm-pit full that through both sides the wound appeared yet still that direful stroke kept on his way and falling heavy on cambelloes crest struck him so hugely that in swown he lay and in his head and hideous wound impressed and sure had it not happily found rest upon the brim of his broad plated shield it would have cleft his brain down to his breast so both at once fell dead upon the field and each to other seemed the victory to yield which when as all the lookers on beheld they weened sure the war was at and end and judges rose and marshals of the field broke up the lists their arms away to rend and canacee gan wail her dearest friend all suddenly they both upstarted light the one out of the swoon which him did blend the other breathing now another spright and fiercely each assailing gan afresh to fight long while they then continued in that wise as if but then the battle had begun strokes wounds wards weapons all they did despise ne either cared to ward or peril shun desirous both to have the battle done ne either cared life to save or spill ne which of them did win ne which were won so weary both of fighting had their fill that life it self seemed loathsome and long safety ill while thus the case in doubtful balance hung unsure to whither side it would incline and all men's eyes and hearts which there among stood gazing filled were with rueful tine and secret fear to see their fatal fine all suddenly they herd a troublous noise that seemed some perilous tumult to desine confused with women's cries and shouts of boys such as the troubled theaters oftimes annoys thereat the champions both stood still a space to weeten what that sudden clamour meant lo where they spied with speedy whirling pace one in a chariot of strange furniment towards them driving like a storm out sent the chariot decked was in wondrous wise with gold and many a gorgeous ornament after the persian monarchs antique guise such as the maker self could best by art devise and drawn it was that wonder is to tell of two grim lyons taken from the wood in which their pour all others did excel now made forget their former cruel mood obey their riders hest as seemed good and therein sat a lady passing fair and bright that seemed born of angels brood and with her beauty bounty did compare whither of them in her should have the greater share thereto she learned was in magic lere and all the arts that subtle wits discover having therein be trained many a year and well instructed by the faith her mother that in the same she far excelled all other who understanding by her mighty art of evil plighted in which her dearest brother now stood came forth in haste to take his part and pacify the strife which caused so deadly smart and as she passed through unruly press of people thronging thick her to behold her angry term breaking their bonds of peace great heaps of them like sheep in narrow fold for haste did overrun in dust enrolled that through rude confusion of the rout some fearing shrieked some being harmed hold some laughed for sport some did for wonder shout and some that would seem wise their wonder turned to doubt in her right hand a rod of peace she boar about the which two serpents weren wound entrailed mutually in lovely lore and by the tails together firmly bound and both were with one olive garland crowned like to the rod which maias son does wield wherewith the hellishfiends he does confound and in her other hand a cup she held the which was with nepenthe to the brim upfilled nepenthe is a drink of sovereign grace devised by the gods for to assuage hearts grief and bitter gall away to chase which stirs up anguish and contentious rage in stead thereof sweet peace and quiet age it does establish in the troubled mind few men but such as sober are and sage are by the gods to drink thereof assigned but such as drink eternal happiness do find such famous men such worthies of the earth as love will have advanced to the sky and there made gods though born of mortal berth for their high merits and great dignity are wont before they may to heaven fly to drink hereof whereby all cares forepast are washed away quite from their memory so did those old heroes hereof taste before that they in bliss among the gods were placed much more of price and of more gracious pour is this then that same water of ardenne the which rinaldo drunk in happy hour described by that famous tuscan pen with whom he led a long and happy life and cambel took cambina to his fere the which as life were each to other lief so all alike did love and loved were that since their days such lovers were not found elsewhere cant. iiii satyrane makes a tournament for love of florimell britomart wins the prize from all and artegall does quell it often falls as here it erst befell that mortal foes do turn to faithful friends and friends professed are changed to foemen fell the cause of both of both their minds depends and th'end of both likewise of both their ends for enmity that of no ill proceeds but of occasion with occasion ends and friendship which a faint affection breeds without regard of good dies like ill grounded seeds that well me seems appears by that oflate betwixt camhell and sir triamond befell as else by this that now a new debate stirred up betwixt scudamour and paridell the which by course befalls me here to tell who having those two other knights espied marching afore as you remember well sent forth their squire to have them both descried and eke those masked ladies riding them beside who back returning told as he had seen that they were doughty knights of dreaded name and those two ladies their two loves unseen and therefore wished them without blot or blame to let them pass at will for dread of shame but blandamour full of vainglorious spright and rather stirred by his discordful dame upon them gladly would have proved his might but that he yet was soar of his late luckless fight yet nigh approaching he them fowl bespoke disgracing them him self thereby to grace as was his wont so weening way to make to ladies love where so he came in place and with lewd terms their lovers to deface whose sharp provokement them incensed so soar that both were bent avenge his usage base and gan their shields address them selves afore for evil deeds may better then bad words be boar but fair cambina with persuasions mild did mitigate the fierceness of their mode that for the present they were reconciled and gan to treat of deeds of arms abroad and strange adventures all the way they road among the which they told as then befell of that great turney which was blazed broad for that rich girdle of fair florimell the prize of her which did in beauty most excel to which folk-mote they all with one consent sith each of them his lady had him by whose beauty each of them thought excellent agreed to travel and their fortune's try so as they passed forth they did espy one in bright arms with ready spear in rest that towards them his course seemed to apply gainst whom sir paridell himself addressed him weening ere he nigh approached to have repressed which th'other seeing gan his course relent and vaunted spear eftsoons to disadvance as if he nought but peace and pleasure meant now fallen into their fellowship by chance whereat they showed courteous countenance so as he road with them accompanied his roving eye did on the lady glance which blandamour had riding by his side whom sure he weened that he some where tofore had eyed it was to weet that snowy florimell which ferrat late from braggadochio won whom he now seeing her remembered well how having reft her from the witches son he soon her lost wherefore he now begun to challenge her anew as his own prize whom formerly he had in battle won and proffer made by force her to reprise which scornful offer blandamour gan soon despise and said sir knight sith you this lady claim whom he that hath were loath to loose so light for so to loose a lady were great shame ye shall her win as i have done in fight and lo she shall be placed here in sighed together with this hag beside her set that who so wins her may her have by right but he shall have the hag that is bet and with her always ride till he another get that offer pleased all the company so florimell with ate forth was brought at which they all gan laugh full merrily but braggadochio said he never thought for such and hag that seemed worst then nought his person to imperil so in fight but if to match that lady they had sought another like that were like fair and bright his life he then would spend to justify his right at which his vain excuse they all gan smile as scorning his unmanly cowardice and florimell him foully gan revile that for her sake refused to enterprise the battle offered in so knightly wise and ate eke provoked him privily with love of her and shame of such misprize but nought he cared for friend or enemy for in base mind nor friendship dwells nor enmity but cambell thus did shut up all in jest brave knights and ladies certes you do wrong to stir up strife when most us needs rest that we may us reserve both fresh and strong against the tournament which is not long when who so list to fight may fight his fill till then your challenges you may prolong and then it shall be tried if you will whither shall have the hag or hold the lady still they all agreed so turning all to game and pleasant board they passed forth on their way and all that while where so they road or came that masked mock-knight was their sport and play till that at length upon appointed day unto the place of tournament they came where they before them found in fresh array many a brave knight and many a dainty dame assembled for to get the honour of that game there this fair crew arriving did divide them selves asunder blandamour with those of his on th'one the rest on th'other side but boastful braggadocchio rather chosen for glory vain their fellowship to loose that men on him the more might gaze alone the rest them selves in troops did else dispose like as it seemed best to every one the knights in couples marched with ladies linked atone then first of all forth came sir satyrane bearing that precious relic in and ark of gold that bad eyes might it not profane which drawing softly forth out of the dark he open showed that all men it mote mark a gorgeous girdle curiously embossed with pearl & precious stone worth many a mark yet did the workmanship far pass the cost it was the same which lately florimel had lost that same aloft he hung in open view to be the prize of beauty and of might the which eftsoons discovered to it drew the eyes of all allured with close delight and hearts quite robbed with so glorious sighed that all men threw out vows and wishes vain thrice happy lady and thrice happy knight them seemed that could so goodly riches gain so worthy of the peril worthy of the pain then took the bold sir satyrane in hand and huge great spear such as he wont to wield and vancing forth from all the other band of knights addressed his maiden-headed shield showing him self all ready for the field gainst whom there singled from the other side a paynim knight that well in arms was skilled and had in many a battle oft be tried hight bruncheual the bold who fiercely forth did ride so furiously they both together met that neither could the others force sustain as two fierce bulls that strive the rule to get of all the herd meet with so hideous main that both rebutted tumble on the plain so these two champions to the ground were felled where in a maze they both did long remain and in their hands their idle truncheons held which neither able were to wag or once to wielded which when the noble ferramont espied he pricked forth in aid of satyran and him against sir blandamour did ride with all the strength and stiffness that he can but the more strong and stiffly that he ran so much more sorely to the ground he fell that on and heap were tumbled horse and man unto whose rescue forth road paridell but him likewise with that same spear he eke did quell which braggadocchio seeing had no will to hasten greatly to his parties aid albe his turn were next but stood there still as one that seemed doubtful or dismayed but triamond half wroth to see him stayed sternly stepped forth and reached away his spear with which so soar he ferramont assayed that horse and man to ground he quite did bear that neither could in hast themselves again uprear which to avenge sir deuon him did dight but with no better fortune then the rest for him likewise he quickly down did smite and after him sir douglas him addressed and after him sir faliumord forth pressed but none of them against his strokes could stand but all the more the more his praise increased for either they were left upon the land or went away soar wounded of his hapless hand and now by this sir satyrane abraid out of the swown in which too long he lay and looking round about like one dismayed when as he saw the merciless affray which doughty triamond had wrought that day unto the noble knights of maidenhead his mighty heart did almost rend in tway for very gall that rather wholly dead himself he wished have been then in so bad a stead eftsoones he gan to gather up around his weapons which lay scattered all abroad and as it fell his steed he ready found on whom remounting fiercely forth he road like spark of fire that from the anvil glowed there where he saw the valiant triamond chasing and laying on them heavy load that none his force were able to withstand so dreadful were his strokes so deadly was his hound with that at him his brauelike spear he aimed and thereto all his power and might applied the wicked steel for mischief first ordained and having now misfortune god for guide stayed not till it arrived in his side and therein made a very grisly wound that streams of blood his armour all bedyed much was he daunted with that direful stound that scarce he him upheld from falling in a found yet as he might himself he soft withdrew out of the field that none perceived it plain then gan the part of challengers anew to range the field and victorlike to rain that none against them battle durst maintain by that the gloomy evening on them fell that forced them from fighting to refrain and trumpets found to cease did them compel so satyrane that day was judged to bear the bell the morrow next the turney gan anew and with the first the hardy satyrane appeared in place with all his noble crew on th'other side full many a warlike swain assembled were that glorious prize to gain but amongst them all was not sir triamond unable he new battle to deraign through grievance of his late received wound that doubly did him grieve when so himself he found which cambell seeing though he could not salve ne done undo yet for to salve his name and purchase honour in his friends behalf this goodly counterfeisance he did frame the shield and arms well known to be the same which triamond had worn unwares to wight and to his friend unwist for doubt of blame if he misdid he on himself did dight that none could him discern and so went forth to fight there satyrane lord of the field he found triumphing in great joy and jollity gainst whom none able was to stand on ground that much he gan his glory to envy and cast avenge his friends indignity a mighty spear eftsoons at him he bent who seeing him come on so furiously met him midway with equal hardiment that forcibly to ground they both together went they up again them selves can lightly rear and to their tried swords them selves betake with which they wrought such wondrous marvels there that all the rest it did amazed make ne any dared their peril to partake now cuffling close now chasing to and from now hurtling round advantage for to take as two wild boars together grappling go chafing and foaming choler each against his foe so as they coursed and tourneyed here and there it chanced sir satyrane his steed at last whither through foundering or through sudden fear to stumble that his rider nigh he cast which vantage cambell did pursue so fast that ere him self he had recovered well so soar he soused him on the compassed crest that forced him to leave his lofty fell and rudely tumbling down under his horse feet fell lightly cambello leapt down from his steed for to have rend his shield and arms away that whilom wont to be the victor's meed when all unwares he felt and hideous sway of many swords that load on him did lay and hundred knights had him enclosed round to rescue satyrane out of his prey all which at once huge strokes on him did pound in hope to take him prisoner where he stood on ground he with their multitude was nought dismayed but with stout courage turned upon them all and with his brandiron round about him laid of which he dealt large alms as did befall like as a lion that by chance does fallen into the hunter's toil does rage and roar in royal heart disdaining to be thrall but all in vain for what might one do more they have him taken captive though it grieve him soar whereof when news to triamond was brought there as he lay his wound he soon forgotten and starting up straight for his armour sought in vain he sought for there he found it not cambello it away before had god cambelloes arms therefore he on him threw and lightly issued forth to take his lot there he in troop found all that warlike crew leading his friend away full sorry to his view into the thickest of that knightly press he thrust and smote down all that was between carried with fervent zeal ne did he cease till that he came where he had cambell seen like captive thrall two other knights atween there he among them cruel havoc makes that they which led him soon inforced been to let him lose to save their proper stakes who being freed from one a weapon fiercely takes with that he drives at them with dreadful might both in remembrance of his friends late harm and in revengement of his own despite so both together give a new alarm as if but now the battle waxed warm as when two greedy wolves do break by force into and herd far from the husband farm they spoil and ravine without all remorse so did these two through all the field their foes enforce fiercely they followed on their bold emprise till trumpets found did warn them all to rest then all with one consent did yield the prize to triamond and cambell as the best but triamond to cambell it released and cambell it to triamond transferred each labouring advance the others gest and make his praise before his own preferred so that the doom was to another day differed the last day came when all those knights again assembled were their deeds of arms to show full many deeds that day were showed plain but satyrane above all the other crew his wondrous worth declared in all men's view for from the first he to the last endured and though some while fortune from him withdrew yet evermore his honour he recured and with unwearied pour his party still assured ne was there knight that ever thought of arms but that his utmost prowess there made known that by their many wounds and careless harms by shivered spears and swords all under strewn by scattered shields was easy to be shown there might you see lose steeds at random run whose luckless riders late were overthrown and squires make haste to help their lords fordone but still the knights of maidenhead the better won till that there entered on the other side a stranger knight from whence no man could reed in quyent disguise full hard to be descried for all his armour was like salvage weed with woody moss bedight and all his steed with oaken leaves attrapped that seemed fit for salvage wight and thereto well agreed his word which on his ragged shield was writ saluagesse sans finesse showing secret wit he at his first incoming charged his spear at him that first appeared in his sighed that was to weet the stout sir sangliere who well was known to be a valiant knight approved oft in many a perilous fight him at the first encounter down he smote and overbore beyond his crouper quite and after him another knight that hight sir brianor so soar that none him life behight then ere his hand he reared he overthrew seuen knights one after other as they came and when his spear was burst his sword he drew the instrument of wrath and with the same fared like a lion in his bloody game hewing and slashing shields and helmets bright and beating down what ever nigh him came that every one gan shun his dreadful sighed no less then death it self in dangerous affright much wondered all men what or whence he came that did among the troops so tyrannise and each of other gan inquire his name but when they could not learn it by no wise most answerable to his wild disguise it seemed him to term the salvage knight but certes his right name was otherwise though known to few that arthegall he hight the doughtiest knight that lived that day and most of might thus was sir satyrane with all his band by his sole manhood and achievement stout dismayed that none of them in field durst stand but beaten were and chased all about so he continued all that day throughout till evening that the sun gan downward bend then rushed forth out of the thickest rout a stranger knight that did his glory shend so nought maybe esteemed happy till the end he at his entrance charged his powerful spear at artegall in midst of his pride and therewith smote him on his umbriere so soar that tumbling back he down did slide over his horses tail above a stride whence little lust he had to rise again which cambell seeing much the same envied and ran at him with all his might and main but shortly was likewise seen lying on the plain whereat full inly wroth was triamond and cast t'euenge the shame done to his friend but by his friend himself eke soon he found in no less need of help then him he weened all which when blandamour from end to end beheld he wox therewith displeased soar and thought in mind it shortly to amend his spear he fewtered and at him it boar but with no better fortune then the rest afore full many others at him likewise ran but all of them likewise dismounted were ne certes wonder for no pour of man could bide the force of that enchanted spear the which this famous britomart did bear with which she wondrous deeds of arms achieved and overthrew what ever came her near that all those stranger knights full soar aggrieved and that late weaker band of challengers relieved like as in summers day when raging heat does burn the earth and boiled rivers dry that all brutus beasts forced to refrain from meat do hunt for shade where shrouded they may lie and missing it feign from themselves to fly all travellers tormented are with pain a watery cloud does overcast the sky and pours forth a sudden shower of rain that all the wretched world recomforts again so did the warlike britomart restore the prize to knights of maidenhead that day which else was like to have be lost and boar the praise of prowess from them all away then shrilling trumpets loudly gan to bray and bade them leave their labours and long toil to joyous feast and other gentle play where beauty's prize should win that precious spoil where i with found of trump will also rest a while cant. v. the ladies for the girdle siriue of famous florimell scudumour coming to cares house does sleep from him expel it hath be through all ages ever seen that with the praise of arms and chivalry the prize of beauty still hath joined been and that for reasons special privity for either does on other much rely for he me seems most fit the fair to serve that can her best defend from villainy and she most fit his service does deserve that fairest is and from her faith will never swerve so fitly now here comes next in place after the proof of prowess ended well the controverse of beauty's sovereign grace in which to her that does the most excel shall fallen the girdle of fair florimell that many wish to win for glory vain and not for virtuous use which some do tell that glorious belt did in it self contain which ladies ought to love and seek for to obtain that girdle gave the virtue of chaste love and wifehood true to all that did it bear but whosoever contrary does prove might not the same about her middle wear but it would lose or else a sunder tear whilom it was as fairies wont report dame venus girdle by her esteemed deer what time she used to live in wifely sort but laid aside when so she used her looser sport her husband vulcan whilom for her sake when first he loved her with heart entire this precious ornament they say did make and wrought in lemno with unquenched fire and afterwards did for her loves first hire give it to her for ever to remain therewith to bind lascivious desire and lose affections streightly to restrain which virtue it for ever after did retain the same one day when she her self disposed to visit her beloved paramour the god of war she from her middle loosed and left behind her in her secret bower on aridalian mount where many and hour she with the pleasant graces wont to play there florimell in her first ages flower was fostered by those graces as they say and brought with her from thence that goodly belt away that goodly belt was cestas hight by name and as her life by her esteemed deer no wonder then if that to win the same so many ladies sought as shall appear for peerless she was thought that did it bear and now by this their feast all being ended the judges which thereto selected were into the martian field adown descended to deem this doubtful case for which they all contended but first was question made which of those knights that lately tourneyed had the wager won there was it judged by those worthy wights that satyrane the first day best had done for he last ended having first begun the second was to triamond behight for that he saved the victor from fordone for cambell victor was in all men's sighed till by mishap he in his foemans' hand did light the third days prize unto that stranger knight whom all men termed knight of the ebony spear to britomart was given by good right for that with puissant stroke she down did bear the salvage knight that victor was whilere and all the rest which had the best afore and to the last unconquered did appear for last is deemed best to her therefore the fairest lady was adjudged for paramore but thereat greatly grudged arthegall and much repined that both of victor's meed and eke of honour she did him forestall yet mote he not withstand what was decreed but inly thought of that despiteful deed fit time await avenged for to be this being ended thus and all agreed then next ensued the paragon to see of beauty's praise and yield the fairest her due fee then first cambello brought unto their view his fair cambina covered with a veil which being once withdrawn most perfect hew and passing beauty did eftsoons reveal that able was weak hearts away to steal next did sir triamond unto their sighed the face of his deer canacee unheal whose beauty's beam eftsoons did shine so bright that dazed the eyes of all as with exceeding light and after her did paridell produce his false duessa that she might be seen who with her forged beauty did seduce the hearts of some that fairest her did ween as diverse wits affected diverse been then did sir ferramont unto them show his lucida that was full fair and sheen and after these and hundred ladies more appeared in place the which each other did outgo all which who so dare think for to enchase him needs sure a golden pen i ween to tell the feature of each goodly face for since the day that they created been so many heavenly faces were not seen assembled in one place ne he that thought for chian folk to portrait beauty's queen by view of all the fairest to him brought so many fair did see as here he might have sought at last the most redoubted britonesse her lovely amoret did open show whose face discovered plainly did express the heavenly portrait of bright angels hew well weened all which her that time did view that she should surely bear the bell away till blandamour who thought he had the true and very florimell did her display the sighed of whom once seen did all the rest dismay for all afore that seemed fair and bright now base and contemptible did appear compared to her that shone as phebes light among the lesser stars in evening clear all that her saw with wonder ravished wear and weened no mortal creature she should be but some celestial shape that flesh did bear yet all were glad there florimell to see yet thought that florimell was not so fair as she as guileful goldsmith that by secret skill with golden foil does finely over spread some baser metal which commend he will unto the vulgar for good gold instead he much more goodly gloss thereon does shed to hide his falsehood then if it were true so hard this idol was to be aread that florimell her self in all men's view she seemed to pass so forged things do fairest show then was that golden belt by doom of all granted to her as to the fairest dame which being brought about her middle small they thought to gird as best it her became but by no means they could it thereto frame for ever as they fastened it it loosed and fell away as feeling secret blame full oft about her waste she it enclosed and it as oft was from about her waste disclosed that all men wondered at the uncouth sighed and each one thought as to their fancies came but she her self did think it done for spite and touched was with secret wrath and shame therewith as thing devise her to defame then many other ladies likewise tried about their tender loins to knit the same but it would not on none of them abide but when they thought it fast eftsoons it was untied which when that scornful squire of dams did view he loudly gan to laugh and thus to jest alas for pity that so fair a crew as like can not be seen from east to west cannot find one this girdle to invest fie on the man that did it first invent to shame us all with this ungirded unblest let never lady to his love assent that hath this day so many so unmanly shent thereat all knights gan laugh and ladies lower till that at last the gentle amoret likewise assayed to prove that girdles pour and having it about her middle set did find it fit withouten breach or let whereat the rest gan greatly to envy but florimell exceedingly did fret and snatching from her hand half angrily the belt again about her body gan it tie yet nathemore would it her body fit yet natheless to her as her due right it yielded was by them that judged it and she her self adjudged to the knight that boar the ebony spear as won in fight but britomart would not thereto assent ne her own amoret forgo so light for that strange dame whose beauty's wonderment she less esteemed then th'others virtuous government whom when the rest did see her to refuse they were full glad in hope themselves to get her yet at her choice they all did greatly muse but after that the judges did arrest her unto the second best that loved her better that was the salvage knight but he was gone in great displeasure that he could not get her then was she judged triamond his one but triamond loved canacee and other none tho unto satyran she was adjudged who was right glad to gain so goodly meed but blandamour thereat full greatly grudged and little praised his labours evil speed that for to win the saddle lost the steed ne less thereat did paridell complain and thought appeal from that which was decreed to single combat with sir satyrane thereto him ate stirred new discord to maintain and eke with these full many other knights she through her wicked working did incense her to demand and challenge as their rights deserved for their perils recompense among the rest with boastful vain pretense stepped braggadochio forth and as his thrall her claimed by him in battle won long since whereto her self he did to witness call who being asked accordingly confessed all thereat exceeding wroth was satyran and wroth with satyran was blandamour and wroth with blandamour was eriuan and at them both sir paridell did lour so all together stirred up strifeful stour and ready were new battle to deraign each one professed to be her paramour and vowed with spear and shield it to maintain ne judges pour ne reasons rule mote them restrain which troublous stir when satyrane advised he gan to cast how to appease the same and to accord them all this means devise first in the midst to set that fairest dame to whom each once his challenge should disclaim and he himself his right would eke release then look to whom she voluntary came he should without disturbance her possess sweet is the love that comes alone with willingness they all agreed and then that snowy maid was in the midst placed among them all all on her gazing wished and vowed and prayed and to the queen of beauty close did call that she unto their portion might befall then when she long had looked upon each one as though she wished to have pleased them all at last to braggadochio self alone she came of her accord in spite of all his foes which when they all beheld they chafed and raged and wox nigh mad for very hearts despite that from revenge their wills they scarce assuaged some thought from him her to have reft by might some proffer made with him for her to fight but he nought cared for all that they could say for he their words as wind esteemed light yet not fit place he thought it there to stay but secretly from thence that night her boar away they which remained so soon as they perceived that she was gone departed thence with speed and followed them in mind her to have reaved from wight unworthy of so noble meed in which pursuit how each one did succeed shall else be told in order as it fell but now of britomart it here does need the hard adventures and strange haps to tell since with the rest she went not after florimell for soon as she them saw to discord set her list no longer in that place abide but taking with her lovely amoret upon her first adventure forth did ride to seek her loved making blind love her guide unlucky maid to seek her enemy unlucky maid to seek him far and wide whom when he was unto her self most nigh she through his late disguisement could him not descry so much the more her grief the more her toil yet neither toil nor grief she once did spare in seeking him that should her pain assoil whereto great comfort in her sad misfare was amoret companion of her care who likewise sought her lover long miswent the gentle scudamour whose heart whilere that strifeful hag with jealous discontent had filled that he to fell revenge was fully bent bent to revenge on blameless britomart the crime which cursed ate kindled erst the which like thorns did prick her jealous heart and through his soul like poisoned arrow pierced that by no reason it might be reversed for ought that glauce could or do or say for aye the more that she the same rehearsed the more it galled and grieved him night and day that nought but dire revenge his anger mote defray so as they traveled the drooping night covered with cloudy storm and bitter shower that dreadful seemed to every living wight upon them fell before her timely hour that forced them to seek some covert bower where they might hide their heads in quiet rest and shroud their persons from that stormy stour not far away not meet for any guest they spied a little cottage like some poor men nest under a steep hills side it placed was there where the mouldered earth had caved the bank and fast beside a little brook did pass of muddy water that like puddle stank by which few crooked sallows grew in rank whereto approaching nigh they herd the found of many iron hammers beating rank and answering their weary turns around that seemed some blacksmith dwelled in that desert ground there entering in they found the goodman self full busily unto his work bend who was to weet a wretched wearish self with hollow eyes and rawbone cheeks forspent as if he had in prison long be penned full black and grisly did his face appear besmeared with smoke that nigh his eyesight blended with rugged beard and hoary shagged hear the which he never wont to comb or comely shear rude was his garment and to rags all rend ne better had he ne for better cared with blistered hands amongst the cinders brent and fingers filthy with long nails unpared right fit to rend the food on which he fared his name was care a blacksmith by his trade that neither day nor night from working spared but to small purpose iron wedges made those be unquiet thoughts that careful minds invade in which his work he had sixe servants pressed about the anvil standing evermore with huge great hammers that did never rest from heaping strokes which thereon soused soar all sixe strong grooms but one then other more for by degrees they all were disagreed so likewise did the hammers which they boar like bells in greatness orderly succeed that he which was the last the first did far exceed he like a monstrous giant seemed in sighed far passing bronteus or pynacmon great the which in lipari do day and night frame thunderbolts for ioues avengeful threat so dreadfully he did the anvil beatrice that seemed to dust he shortly would it driven so huge his ham mere and so fierce his heat that seemed a rock of diamond it could rive and rend a sunder quite if he thereto list strive sit scudamour there entering much admired the manner of their work and weary pain and having long beheld at last inquired the cause and end thereof but all in vain for they for nought would from their work refrain ne let his speeches come unto their ear and eke the breathful bellows blew amain like to the northern wind that none could hear those pensiveness did move & sighs the bellows wear which when that warrior saw he said no more but in his armour laid him down to rest to rest he laid him down upon the flore whilom for venturous knights the bedding best and thought his weary limbs to have redressed and that old aged dame his faithful squire her feeble joints laid eke a down to rest that needed much her weak age to desire after so long a travel which them both did tire there lay sir scudamour long while expecting when gentle sleep his heavy eyes would close oft changing sides and oft new place electing where better seemed he mote himself repose and oft in wrath he thence again uprose and oft in wrath he laid him down again but wheresoever he did himself dispose he by no means could wished ease obtain so every place seemed painful and each changing vain and evermore when he to sleep did think the hammers found his senses did molest and evermore when he began to wink the bellows noise disturbed his quiet rest ne suffered sleep to settle in his breast and all the night the dogs did bark and howl about the house at sent of stranger guest and now the crowing cock and now the owl loud shrieking him afflicted to the very soul and if by fortune any little nap upon his heavy eyelids chanced to fallen eftsoons one of those villains him did rap upon his headpiece with his iron mall that he was soon awaked therewithal and lightly started up as one afraid or as if one him suddenly did call so oftentimes he out of sleep abraid and then lay musing long on that him ill payed so long he mused and so long he lay that at the last his weary sprite oppressed with fleshly weakness which no creature may long time resist gave place to kindly rest that all his senses did full soon arrest yet in his soundest sleep his daily fear his idle brain gan busily molest and made him dream those two disloyal were the things that day most minds at night do most appear with that the wicked carl the master smith a pair of redhot iron tongue's did take out of the burning cinders and therewith under his side him nipped that forced to wake he felt his heart for very pain to quake and started up avenged for to be on him the which his quiet slumber brake yet looking round about him none could see yet did the smart remain though he himself did flee in such disquiet and heartfretting pain he all that night that too long night did pass and now the day out of the ocean main began to peep above this earthly mass with pearly due sprinkling the morning grass then up he rose like heavy lump of led that in his face as in a looking glass the signs of anguish one mote plainly read and guess the man to be dismayed with jealous dread unto his lofty steed he climbed anon and forth upon his former voyage fared and with him eke that aged squire atone who whatsoever peril was prepared both equal pains and equal peril shared the end whereof and dangerous event shall for another canticle be spared but here my weary teem nigh over spent shall breath it self awhile after so long a went cant. vi both scadamour and arthegall do fight with britomart he sees her face does fallen in love and soon from her depart what equal torment to the grief of mind and pining anguish hid in gentle heart that inly feeds it self with thoughts unkind and nourishes her own consuming smart what medicine can any leeches art yield such a soar that does her grievance hide and will to none her malady impart such was the wound that scudamour did gride for which dan phebus self cannot a salve provide who having left that restless house of care the next day as he on his way did ride full of melancholy and sad misfare through misconceit all unawares espied and armed knight under a forest side sitting in shade beside his grazing steed who soon as them approaching he descried gan towards them to prick with eager speed that seemed he was full bent to some mischievous deed which scudamour perceiving forth issued to have rencountered him in equal raze but soon as th'other nigh approaching viewed the arms he boar his spear he gan abase and void his course at which so sudden case he wondered much but th'other thus can say ah gentle scudamour unto your grace i me submit and you of pardon pray that almost had against you trespassed this day whereto thus scudamour small harm it were for any knight upon a venturous knight without displeasance for to prove his spear but read you sir sith you my name have hight what is your own that i mote you requite certes said he you mote as now excuse me from discovering you my name aright for time yet serves that i the same refuse but call you me the salvage knight as others use then this sir salvage knight quoth he aread or do you here within this forest won that seems well to answer to your weed or have you it for some occasion done that rather seems sith known arms you shun this other day said he a stranger knight shame and dishonour hath unto me done on whom i wait to wreak that foul despite when ever he this way shall pass by day or night shame be his meed quoth he that means shame but what is he by whom you shamed were a stranger knight said he unknown by name but known by fame and by and ebony spear with which he all that met him down did bear he in and open turney lately held from me the honour of that game did rear and having me all weary erst down felled the fairest lady reft and ever since withheld when scudamour herd mention of that spear he wist right well that it was britomart the which from him his fairest love did bear tho gan he swell in every inner part for fell despite and gnaw his jealous heart that thus he sharply said now by my head yet is not this the first unknightly part which that same knight whom by his lance i read hath done to noble knights that many makes him dread for lately he my love hath from me rest and eke defiled with foul villainy the sacred pledge which in his faith was left in shame of knighthood and fidelity the which ere long full deer he shall aby and if to that avenge by you decreed this hand may help or succour ought supply it shall not fail when so you shall it need so both to wreak their wraths on britomart agreed while thus they communed lo far away a knight soft riding towards them they spied attired in foreign arms and strange array whom when they nigh approached they plain descried to be the same for whom they did abide said then sir scudamour sir salvage knight let me this crave sith first i was defied that first i may that wrong to him requite and if i hap to fail you shall recure my right which being yielded he his threatfully spear gan fewter and against her fiercely ran who soon as she him saw approaching near with so fell rage her self she lightly gan to dight to welcome him well as she can but entertained him in so rude a wise that to the ground she smote both horse and man whence neither greatly hasted to arise but on their common harms together did devise but artegall beholding his mischance new matter added to his former fire and eft adventuring his steelheaded lance against her road full of despiteous ire that nought but spoil and vengeance did require but to himself his felonous intent returning disappointed his desire while unawares his saddle he forwent and found himself on ground in great amazement lightly he started up out of that stound and snatching forth his direful deadly blade did leap to her as does and eager hound thrust to and hind within some covert glade whom without peril he cannot invade with such fell greediness he her assailed that though she mounted were yet he her made to give him ground so much his force prevailed and shun his mighty strokes gainst which no arms availed so as they coursed here and there it chanced that in her wheeling round behind her crest so sorely he her struck that thence it glanced adown her back the which it fairly blessed from foul mischance ne did it ever rest till on her horses hinder parts it fell where biting deep so deadly it impressed that quite it chined his back behind the fell and to alight on foot her algates did compel like as the lightning brand from riven sky thrown out by angry ioue in his vengeance with dreadful force falls on some steeple high which battering down it on the church does glance and tears it all with terrible mischance yet she no whit dismayed her steed forsook and casting from her that enchanted lance unto her sword and shield her soon betook and therewithal at him right furiously she struck so furiously she struck in her first heat while with long fight on foot he breathless was that she him forced backward to retreat and yield unto her weapon way to pass whose raging rigour neither steel nor brass could stay but to the tender flesh it went and poured the purple blood forth on the grass that all his mail rived and plataeae rent showed all his body bore unto the cruel dent at length when as he saw her hasty heat abate and panting breath begin to fail he through long sufferance growing now more great rose in his strength and gan her fresh assail heaping huge strokes as thick as shower of hail and lashing dreadfully at every part as if he thought her soul to disentrail ah cruel hand and thrice more cruel heart that workest such wreck on her to whom thou dearest art what iron courage ever could endure to work such outrage on so fair a creature and in his madness think with hands impure to spoil so goodly workmanship of nature the maker self resembling in her feature certes some hellish fury or some fiend this mischief framed for their first loves defeature to both their hands in blood of dearest friend thereby to make their loves beginning their lines end thus long they traced and traversed to and from sometime pursuing and sometime pursued still as advantage they espied thereto but towards th'end sir arthegall renewed his strength still more but she still more decrewed at last his luckless hand he heaved on high having his forces all in one accrued and therewith stroke at her so hideously that seemed nought but death mote be her destiny the wicked stroke upon her helmet chanced and with the force which in it self it boar her ventail shared away and thence forth glanced a down in vain ne harmed her any more with that her angels face unseen afore like to the ruddy morn appeared in sighed dewed with silver drops through sweating soar but somewhat redder then beseemed aright through toilsome heat and labour of her weary fight and round about the same her yellow hear having through stirring loosed their wonted band like to a golden border did appear framed in goldsmith's forge with cunning hand yet goldsmith's cunning could not understand to frame such subtle wire so shiny clear for it did glister like the golden sand the which pactolus with his waters shear throws forth upon the rivage round about him never and as his hand he up again did rear thinking to work on her his utmost wrack his powerless arm benumbed with secret fear from his revengeful purpose shrunk aback and cruel sword out of his fingers slack fell down to ground as if the steel had sense and felt some ruth or sense his hand did lack or both of them did think obedience to do to so divine a beauty's excellence and he himself long gazing thereupon at last fell humbly down upon his knee and of his wonder made religion weening some heavenly goddess he did see or else unweeting what it else might be and pardon her besought his error frail that had done outrage in so high degree whilst trembling horror did his sense assail and made each member quake and manly heart to quail natheless she full of wrath for that late stroke all that long while upheld her wrathful hand with fell intent on him to be wreaked and looking stern still over him did stand threatening to strike unless he would withstand and bade him rise or surely he should die but die or live for nought he would upstand but her of pardon prayed more earnestly or wreak on him her will for so great injury which when as scudamour who now abraid beheld whereas he stood not far aside he was therewith right wondrously dismayed and drawing nigh when as he plain descried that peerless pattern of dame nature's pride and heavenly image of perfection he blessed himself as one soar terrified and turning his fear to faint devotion did worship her as some celestial vision but glauce seeing all that chanced there well weeting how their error to assoil full glad of so good end to them drew never and her saluted with seemly belaccoyle joyous to see her safe after long toil then her besought as she to her was deer to grant unto those warriors truce a while which yielded they their beavers up did rear and showed themselves to her such as indeed they were when britomart with sharp adviceful eye beheld the lovely face of artegall tempered with sternness and stout majesty she gan eftsoons it to her mind to call to be the same which in her father's hall long since in that enchanted glass she saw therewith her wrathful courage gan appall and haughty spirits meekly to adaw that her enhanced hand she down can soft withdraw yet she it forced to have again upheld as feigning choler which was turned to cold but ever when his visage she beheld her hand fell down and would no longer hold the wrathful weapon gainst his countenance bold but when in vain to fight she oft assayed she armed her tongue and thought at him to scold natheless her tongue not to her will obeyed but brought forth speeches mild when she would have missaid but scudamour now waxed inly glad that all his jealous fear he false had found and how that hag his love abused had with breach of faith and loyalty unsound the which long time his grieved heart did wound her thus bespoke certes sir artegall i joy to see you lout so low on ground and now become to live a ladies thrall that whilom in your mind wont to despise them all soon as she herd the name of artegall her heart did leap and all her heartstrings tremble for sudden joy and secret fear withal and all her vital powers with motion nimble to succour it themselves gan there assemble that by the swift recourse of flushing blood right plain appeared though she it would dissemble and feigned still her former angry mood thinking to hide the depth by troubling of the flood when glauce thus gan wisely all upknit you gentle knights whom fortune here hath brought to be spectators of this uncouth fit which secret fate hath in this lady wrought against the course of kind ne marvel nought ne thenceforth fear the thing that hitherto hath troubled both your minds with idle thought fearing lest she your loves away should woo feared in vain sith means you see there wants thereto and you sir artegall the salvage knight henceforth may not disdain that woman's hand hath conquered you anew in second fight for whilom they have conquered sea and land and heaven it self that nought may them withstand ne henceforth be rebellious unto love that is the crown of knighthood and the band of noble minds derived from above which being knit with virtue never will remove and you fair lady knight my dearest dame relent the rigour of your wrathful will whose fire were better turned to other flame and wiping out remembrance of all ill grant him your grace but so that he fulfil the penance which you shall to him impart for lovers heaven must pass by sorrows hell thereat full inly blushed britomart but artegall close smiling joyed in secret heart yet durst he not make love so suddenly ne think affection of her heart to draw from one to other so quite contrary beside her modest countenance he saw so goodly graven and full of princely awe that it his ranging fancy did refrain and looser thoughts to lawful bounds withdraw whereby the passion grew more fierce and feign like to a stubborn steed whom strong hand would restrain but scudamour whose heart betwixt doubtful fear and feeble hope hung all this while suspense desiring of his amoret to hear some gladful news and sure intelligence her thus bespoke but sir without offence mote i request you tidings of my love my amoret sith you her freed from thence where she captived long great woes did prove that where you left i may her seek as does behoove to whom thus britomart certes sir knight what is of her become or whither rest i can not unto you aread a right for from that time i from enchanters theft her freed in which you her all hopeless left i her preserved from peril and from fear and evermore from villainy her kept ne ever was there wight to me more deer then she ne unto whom i more true love did bear till on a day as through a desert wild we traveled both weary of the way we did alight and sat in shadow mild where fearless i to sleep me down did lay but when as i did out of sleep abray i found her not where i her left whilere but thought she wandered was or gone astray i called her loud i so ught her far and near but no where could her find nor tidings of her hear when scudamour those heavy tidings herd his heart was thrilled with point of deadly fear ne in his face or blood or life appeared but senseless stood like to a mazed steer that yet of mortal stroke the stound does bear till glauce thus fair sir be nought dismayed with needless dread till certainty you hear for yet she may be safe though somewhat strayed its best to hope the best though of the worst afraid natheless he hardly of her cheerful speech did comfort take or in his troubled sighed showed change of better cheer so soar a breach that sudden news had made into his spright till britomart him fairly thus behight great cause of sorrow certes sir you have but comfort take for by this heavens light i vow you dead or living not to leave till i her find and wreak on him that her did reave therewith he rested and well pleased was so peace being confirmed among them all they took their steeds and forward thence did pass unto some resting place which mote befall all being guided by sir artegall where goodly solace was unto them made and daily feasting both in bower and hall until that they their wounds well healed had and weary limbs recured after late usage bad in all which time sir artegall made way unto the love of noble britomart and with meek service and much suit did lay continual siege unto her gentle heart which being whilom launched with lovely dart more eath was new impression to receive how ever she her pained with womanish art to hide her wound that none might it pereciue vain is the art that seeks it self for to deceive so well he wooed her and so well he wrought her with fair entreaty and sweet blandishment that at the length unto a bay he brought her so as she to his speeches was content to lend and ear and softly to relent at last through many vows which forth he poured and many oaths she yielded her consent to be his love and take him for her lord till they with marriage meet might finish that accord tho when they had long time there taken rest sir artegall who all this while was bound upon and hard adventure yet in quest fit time for him thence to depart it found to follow that which he did long propound and unto her his congee came to take but her therewith full soar displeased he found and loath to leave her late betrothed make her dearest love full loath so shortly to forsake yet he with strong persuasions her assuaged and won her will to suffer him depart for which his faith with her he fast engaged and thousand vows from bottom of his heart that all so soon as he by wit or art could that achieve whereto he did aspire he unto her would speedily revert no longer space thereto he did desire but till the horned moon three courses did expire with which she for the present was appeased and yielded leave how ever malcontent she inly were and in her mind displeased so early in the morrow next he went forth on his way to which he was bend ne wight him to attend or way to guide as whilom was the custom ancient amongst knights when on adventures they did ride save that she algates him a while accompanied and by the way she sundry purpose found of this or that the time for to delay and of the perils whereto he was bound the fear whereof seemed much her to affray but all she did was but to wear out day full oftentimes she leave of him did take and eft again devise some what to say which she forgotten whereby excuse to make so loath she was his company for to forsake at last when all her speeches she had spent and new occasion failed her more to find she left him to his fortune's government and back returned with right heavy mind to scudamour who she had left behind with whom she went to seek fair amoret her second care though in another kind for virtues only sake which does beget true love and faithful friendship she by her did set back to that desert forest they retired where sorry britomart had lost her late there they her sought and every where inquired where they might tidings get of her estate yet found they none but by what hapless fate or hard misfortune she was thence conveyed and stolen away from her beloved mate were long to tell therefore i here will stay until another tied that i it finish may cant. vii amoret rapt by greedy lust belphebe saves from dread the squire her loves and being blamed his days in dole does led great god of love that with thy cruel dart dost conquer greatest conquerors on ground and settest thy kingdom in the captive hearts of kings and keasars to thy service bound what glory or what guerdon hast thou found in feeble ladies tyranning so soar and adding anguish to the bitter wound with which their lives thou launchedest long afore by heaping storms of trouble on them daily more so whilom didst thou to fair florimell and so and so to noble britomart so dost thou now to her of whom i tell the lovely amoret whose gentle heart thou martyrest with sorrow and with smart in salvage forests and in deserts wide with bears and tigers taking heavy part withouten comfort and withouten guide that pity is to hear the perils which she tried so soon as she with that brave britonesse had left that tournament for beauty's prize they traveled long that now for weariness both of the way and warlike exercise both through a forest riding did devise t'alight and rest their weary limbs awhile there heavy sleep the eyelids did surprise of britomart after long tedious toil that did her passed pains in quiet rest assoil the while fair amoret of nought afeard walked through the wood for pleasure or for need when suddenly behind her back she herd one rushing forth out of the thickest weed that ere she back could turn to taken heed had unawares her snatched up from ground feebly she shrieked but so feebly indeed that britomart herd not the shrilling found there where through weary travel she lay sleeping found it was to weet a wild and salvage man yet was no man but only like in shape and eke in stature higher by a span all over grown with hair that could awhape and hardy heart and his wide mouth did gape with huge great teeth like to a boar for he lived all on ravine and on rape of men and beasts and fed on fleshly gore the sign whereof yet stained his bloody lips afore his nether lip was not like man nor beast but like a wide deep poke down hanging low in which he wont the relics of his feast and cruel spoil which he had spared to stow and over it his huge great nose did grow full dreadfully empurpled all with blood and down both sides two wide long ears did glow and reached down to his waste when up he stood more great then ears of elephants by indus flood his waste was with a wreathe of ivy green engirded about ne other garment wore for all his hair was like a garment seen and in his hand a tall young oak he boar whose knotty snags were sharpened all afore and bathed in fire for steel to be in stead but whence he was or of what womb borne of beasts or of the earth i have not read but certes was with milk of wolves and tigers fed this ugly creature in his arms her snatched and through the forest boar her quite away with briers and bushes all to rend and scratched ne care he had ne pity of the prey which many a knight had sought so many a day he stayed not but in his arms her bearing ran till he came to th'end of all his way unto his cave far from all peoples hearing and there he threw her in nought feeling ne nought fearing for she deer lady all the way was dead whilst he in arms her boar but when she felt her self down soused she waked out of dread straight into grief that her deer heart nigh swelled and eft gan into tender tears to melt then when she looked about and nothing found but darkness and dread horror where she dwelled she almost fell again into a swoon ne wist whither above she were or under ground with that she herd some one close by her side sighing and sobbing soar as if the pain her tender heart in pieces would divide which she long listening softly asked again what mister wight it was that so did plain to whom thus answered was ah wretched wight that seeks to know another's grief in vain unweeting of thine own like hapless plighted self to forget to mind another is oversight aye me said she where am i or with whom among the living or among the dead what shall of me unhappy maid become shall death be th'end or ought else worse aread unhappy maid then answered she whose dread untried is less then when thou shalt it try death is to him that wretched life does led both grace and gain but he in hell does lie that lives a loathed life and wishing cannot die this dismal day hath thee a caitiff made and vassal to the vilest wretch alive whose cursed usage and ungodly trade the heavens abhor and into darkness driven for on the spoil of women he does live whose bodies chaste when ever in his pour he may them catch unable to gainstrive he with his shameful lust does first deflower and afterwards themselves does cruelly devour now twenty days by which the sons of men divide their works have passed through heaven sheen since i was brought into this doleful den during which space these sorry eyes have seen seauen women by him slain and eaten clean and now no more for him but i alone and this old woman here remaining been till thou camest hither to augment our moan and of us three to morrow he will sure eat one ah dreadful tidings which thou dost declare quoth she of all that ever hath be known full many great calamities and rare this feeble breast endured hath but none equal to this where ever i have gone but what are you whom like unlucky lot hath linked with me in the same chain atone to tell quoth she that which you see needs not a woeful wretched maid of god and man forgotten but what i was it irks me to rehearse daughter unto a lord of high degree that joyed in happy peace till fates perverse with guileful love did secretly agree to overthrow my state and dignity it was my lot to love a gentle swain yet was he but a squire of low degree yet was he meet unless mine eye did feign by any ladies side for leman to have lain but for his meanness and disparagement my sire who me too dearly well did love unto my choice by no means would assent but often did my folly fowl reprove yet nothing could my fixed mind remove but whither willed or nilled friend or foe i me resolved the utmost end to prove and rather then my love abandon so both sire and friends and all for ever to forgo thenceforth i sought by secret means to work time to my will and from his wrathful sighed to hide intent which in my heart did lurk till i thereto had all things ready dight so on a day unweeting unto wight i with that squire agreed away to flit and in a privy place betwixt us hight within a grove appointed him to meet to which i boldly came upon my feeble feet but ah unhappy hour me thither brought for in that place where i him thought to find there was i found contrary to my thought of this accursed carl of hellish kind the shame of men and plague of womankind who trussing me as eagle does his prey me hither brought with him as swift as wind where yet untouched till this present day i rest his wretched thrall the sad aemylia ah sad aemylia then said amoret thy rueful plighted i pity as mine own but read to me by what devise or wit hast thou in all this time from him unknown thine honour saved though into thraldom thrown through help quoth she of this old woman here i have so done as she to me hath shown for ever when he burned in lustful fire she in my stead supplied his bestial desire thus of their evils as they did discourse and each did other much bewail and moan lo where the villain self their sorrows source came to the cave and rolling thence the stone which wont to stop the mouth thereof that none might issue forth came rudely rushing in and spreading over all the flore alone gan dight him self unto his wonted sin which ended then his bloody banquet should begin which when as fearful amoret perceived she stayed not the utmost end thereof to try but like a ghastly gelded whose wits are reaved ran forth in haste with hideous outcry for horror of his shameful villainy but after her full lightly he uprose and her pursued as fast as she did fly full fast she flies and far afore him goes ne feels the thorns and thickets prick her tender toes nor hedge nor ditch nor hill nor dale she stays but overleaps them all like roebuck light and through the thickest makes her nighest ways and evermore when with regardful sighed she looking back espies that grisly wight approaching nigh she begins to mend her pace and makes her fear a spur to hast her flight more swift then myrrh ' or daphne in her raze or any of the thracian nymph's in salvage chase long so she fled and so he followed long ne living aid for her on earth appears but if the heavens help to redress her wrong moved with pity of her plenteous tears it fortuned belphebe with her pears the woody nymph's and with that lovely boy was hunting then the libbards and the bears in these wild woods as was her wonted joy to banish sloth that oft does noble minds annoy it so befell as oft it falls in chase that each of them from other sundered were and that same gentle squire arrived in place where this same cursed caitiff did appear pursuing that fair lady full of fear and now he her quite overtaken had and now he her away with him did bear under his arm as seeming wondrous glad that by his grinning laughter mote far off be read with dreary sighed the gentle squire espying does hast to cross him by the nearest way led with that woeful ladies piteous crying and him assails with all the might he may yet will not he the lovely spoil down lay but with his craggy club in his right hand defends him self and saves his got prey yet had it be right hard him to withstand but that he was full light and nimble on the land thereto the villain used craft in fight for ever when the squire his javelin shook he held the lady forth before him right and with her body as a buckler broke the puissance of his intended stroke and if it chanced as needs it must in fight whilst he on him was greedy to be wreaked that any little blow on her did light then would he laugh aloud and gather great delight which subtle sleight did him encumber much and made him oft when he would strike forbear for hardly could he come the carl to touch but that he her must hurt or hazard near yet he his hand so carefully did bear that at the last he did himself attain and therein left the pike head of his spear a stream of coalblack blood thence gushed amain that all her silken garments did with blood bestain with that he threw her rudely on the flore and laying both his hands upon his glaive with dreadful strokes let driven at him so soar that forced him fly aback himself to save yet he therewith so felly still did rave that scarce the squire his hand could once uprear but for advantage ground unto him gave tracing and traversing now here now there for bootless thing it was to think such blows to bear whilst thus in battle they embusied were belphebe ranging in that forest wide the hideous noise of their huge strokes did hear and drew thereto making her ear her guide whom when that thief approaching nigh espied with bow in hand and arrows ready bent he by his former combat would not bide but fled away with ghastly dreariment well knowing her to be his death's sole instrument whom seeing fly she speedily pursued with winged feet as nimble as the wind and ever in her bow she ready showed the arrow to his deadly mark designed as when latonaes daughter cruel kind in vengement of her mother's great disgrace with fell despite her cruel arrows tined gainst woeful niobes unhappy raze that all the gods did moan her miserable case so well she sped her and so far she ventured that ere unto his hellish den he reached even as he ready was there to have entered she sent and arrow forth with mighty draught that in the very door him overcaught and in his nape arriving through it thrilled his greedy throat therewith in two distracted that all his vital spirits thereby spilled and all his hairy breast with gory blood was filled whom when on ground she groveling saw to roll she ran in haste his life to have bereft but ere she could him reach the sinful soul having his carrion corpse quite senseless left was fled to hell surcharged with spoil and theft yet over him she there long gazing stood and oft admired his monstrous shape and oft his mighty limbs whilst all with filthy blood the place there overflown seemed like a sudden flood thenceforth she passed into his dreadful den where nought but darksome dreariness she found ne creature saw but hearkened now and then some little whispering and soft groaning found with that she asked what ghosts there under ground lay hid in horror of eternal night and bade them if so be they were not bound to come and show themselves before the light now freed from fear and danger of that dismal wight then forth the said aemylia issued yet trembling every joint through former fear and after her the hag there with her mewed a foul and loathsome creature did appear a leman fit for such a lover deer that moved belphebe her no less to hate then for to rue the others heavy cheer of whom she gan inquire of her estate who all to her at large as happened did relate thence she them brought towards the place where late she left the gentle squire with amoret there she him found by that new lovely mate who lay the while in swoon full sadly set from her fair eyes wiping the dewy wet which softly styled and kissing them atween and handling soft the hurts which she did get for of that carl she sorely bruised had been also of his own rash hand one wound was to be seen which when she saw with sudden glancing eye her noble heart with sighed thereof was filled with deep disdain and great indignity that in her wrath she thought them both have thrilled with that self arrow which the carl had killed yet held her wrathful hand from vengeance soar but drawing nigh ere he her well beheld is this the faith she said and said no more but turned her face and fled away for evermore he seeing her depart arose up light right soar aggrieved at her sharp reproof and followed fast but when he came in sighed he durst not nigh approach but kept aloof for dread of her displeasures utmost proof and evermore when he did grace entreat and framed speeches fit for his behoof her mortal arrows she at him did threat and forced him back with fowl dishonour to retreat at last when long he followed had in vain yet found no ease of grief nor hope of grace unto those woods he turned back again full of sad anguish and in heavy case and finding there fit solitary place for woeful wight chosen out a gloomy glade where hardly eye mote see bright heavens face for mossy trees which covered all with shade and sad melancholy there he his cabin made his wonted warlike weapons all he broke and threw away with vow to use no more ne thenceforth ever strike in battle stroke ne ever word to speak to woman more but in that wilderness of men forlore and of the wicked world forgotten quite his hard mishap in dolour to deplore and wast his wretched days in woeful plighted so on him self to wreak his follies own despite and eke his garment to be thereto meet he wilfully did cut and shape anew and his fair locks that wont with ointment sweet to be embalmed and sweat out dainty due he let to grow and grisly to concrue uncombed uncurled and carelessly unshed that in short time his face they overgrew and over all his shoulders did dispread that who he whilom was uneath was to be read there he continued in this careful plighted wretchedly wearing out his youthly years through wilful penury consumed quite that like a pined ghost he soon appears for other food then that wild forest bears ne other drink there did he ever taste then running water tempered with his tears the more his weakened body so to wast that out of all men's knowledge he was worn at last for on a day by fortune as it fell his own deer lord prince arthure came that way seeking adventures where he mote hear tell and as he through the wandering wood did stray having espied this cabin far away he to it drew to weet who there did won weening therein some holy hermit lay that did resort of sinful people shun or else some woodman shrouded there from scorching sun arriving there he found this wretched man spending his days in dolour and despair and through long fasting waxed pale and wan all overgrown with rude and rugged hair that albeit his own deer squire he were yet he him knew not ne advised at all but like strange wight whom he had seen no where saluting him gan into speech to fallen and pity much his plighted that lived like outcast thrall but to his speech he answered no whit but stood still mute as if he had been dum ne sign of sense did show ne common wit as one with grief and anguish overcome and unto every thing did answer mum and ever when the prince unto him spoke he louted lowly as did him become and humble homage did unto him make midst sorrow showing joyous semblance for his sake at which his uncouth guise and usage quaint the prince did wonder much yet could not guess the cause of that his sorrowful constraint yet weened by secret signs of manliness which close appeared in that rude brutishness that he whilom some gentle swain had been trained up in feats of arms and knightliness which he observed by that he him had seen to wielded his naked sword and try the edges keen and eke by that he saw on every tree how he the name of one engraved had which likely was his liefest love to be for whom he now so sorely was bestead which was by him belphebe rightly read yet who was that belphebe he ne wist yet saw he often how he waxed glad when he it herd and how the ground he kissed wherein it written was and how himself he blessed though when he long had marked his demeanour and saw that all he said and did was vain ne ought mote make him change his wonted tenor ne ought mote ease or mitigate his pain he left him there in languor to remain till time for him should remedy provide and him restore to former grace again which for it is too long here to abide i will defer the end until another tide cant. viii the gentle squire recovers grace slander her guests does stain corflambo chases placidas and is by arthure slain well said the wiseman now proved true by this which to this gentle squire did happen late that the displeasure of the mighty is then death it self more dread and desperate fornaught the same may calm ne mitigate till time the tempest do thereof delay with sufferance soft which rigour can abate and have the stern remembrance wiped away of bitter thoughts which deep therein infixed lay like as it fell to this unhappy boy whose tender heart the fair belphebe had with one stern look so daunted that no joy in all his life which afterwards he led he ever tasted but with penance sad and pensive sorrow pined and wore away ne ever laughed ne once showed countenance glad but always wept and wailed night and day as blasted bloom through heat does languish & decay till on a day as in his wonted wise his dole he made there chanced a turtle dove to come where he his dolors did devise that likewise late had lost her dearest love which loss her made like passion also prove who seeing his sad plighted her tender heart with deer compassion deeply did emmove that she gan moan his undeserved smart and with her doleful accent bear with him a part shee sitting by him as on ground he lay her mournful notes full piteously did frame and thereof made a lamentable lay so sensibly compiled that in the same him seemed oft he herd his own right name with that he forth would pour so plenteous tears and beatrice his breast unworthy of such blame and knock his head and rend his rugged hears that could have pierced the hearts of tigers & of bears thus long this gentle bird to him did use withouten dread of peril to repair unto his won and with her mournful muse him to recomfort in his greatest care that much did ease his mourning and misfare and every day for guerdon of her song he part of his small feast to her would share that at the last of all his woe and wrong companion she became and so continued long upon a day as she him sat beside by chance he certain miniments forth drew which yet with him as relics did abide of all the bounty which belphebe threw on him while goodly grace she did him show among the rest a jewel rich he found that was a ruby of right perfect hew shaped like a heart yet bleeding of the wound and with a little golden chain about it bound the same he took and with a ribbon new in which his ladies colours were did bind about the turtles neck that with the view did greatly solace his engrieved mind all unawares the bird when she did find her self so decked hernimble wings displayed and flew away as lightly as the wind which sudden accident him much dismayed and looking after long did mark which way she strayed but when as long he looked had in vain yet saw her forward still to make her flight his weary eye returned to him again full of discomfort and disquiet plighted that both his jewel he had lost so light and eke his deer companion of his care but that sweet bird departing flew forth right through the wideregion of the wasteful air until she came where woned his belphebe fair there found she her as then it did betide sitting in covert shade of arbours sweet after late weary toil which she had tried in salvage chase to rest as seemed her meet there she alighting fell before her feet and gan to her her mournful plaint to make as was herwont thinking to let her weet the great tormenting grief that for her sake her gentle squire through her displeasure did partake she her beholding with attentive eye at length did mark about her purple breast that precious jewel which she formerly had known right well with coloured ribbons dressed therewith she rose in haste and her addressed with ready hand it to have rest away but the swift bird obeyed not her behest but swerved aside and there again did stay she followed her and thought again it to assay and ever when she nigh approached the dove would flit a little forward and then stay till she drew near and then again remove so tempting her still to pursue the prey and still from her escaping soft away till that at length into that forest wide she drew her far and led with slow delay in th'end she her unto that place did guide whereas that woeful man in languor did abide eftsoones she flew unto his fearless hand and there a piteous ditty new devise as if she would have made him understand his sorrows cause to be of her despised whom when she saw in wretched weeds disguised with hairy glib deformed and meager face like ghost late risen from his graven agrized she knew him not but pitied much his case and wished it were in her to do him any grace he her beholding at her feet down fell and kissed the ground on which her sole did tread and washed the same with water which did well from his moist eyes and like two streams proceed yet spoke no word whereby she might aread what mister wight he was or what he meant but as one daunted with her presence dread only few rueful looks unto her sent as messengers of his true meaning and intent yet nathemore his meaning she aread but wondered much at his so selcouth case and by his persons secret seemlihead well weened that he had been some man of place before misfortune did his hew deface that being moved with ruth she thus bespoke ah woeful man what heavens hard disgrace or wrath of cruel wight on thee wreak or self disliked life does thee thus wretched make if heaven then none may it redress or blame sith to his pour we all are subject born if wrathful wight then fowl rebuke and shame be theirs that have so cruel thee forlorn but if through inward grief or wilful scorn of life it be then better do advise for he whose days in wilful woe are worn the grace of his creator does despise that will not use his gifts for thankless niggardise when so he herd her say eftsoons he brake his sudden silence which he long had penned and sighing inly deep her thus bespoke then have they all themselves against me bent for heaven first author of my languishment envying my too great felicity did closely with a cruel one consent to cloud my days in doleful misery and make me loath this life still longing for to die ne any but your self o dearest dreaded hath done this wrong to wreak on worthless wight your high displeasure through misdeeming bred that when your pleasure is to deem aright you may redress and me restore to light which sorry words her mighty heart did mate with mild regard to see his rueful plighted that her inburning wrath she gan abate and him received again to former favours state in which he long time afterwards did led and happy life with grace and good accord fearless of fortune's change or envies dread and eke all mindless of his own deer lord the noble prince who never herd one word of tidings what did unto him betide or what good fortune did to him afford but through the endless world did wander wide him seeking evermore yet no where him descried till on a day as through that wood he road he chanced to come where those two ladies late aemylia and amoret abided both in full sad and sorrowful estate the one right feeble through the evil rate of food which in her duress she had found the other almost dead and desperate through her late hurts and through that hapless wound with which the squire in her defence her soar astounded whom when the prince beheld he gan to rew the evil case in which those ladies lay but most was moved at the piteous view of amoret so near unto decay that her great danger did him much dismay eftsoones that precious liquour forth he drew which he in store about him kept always and with few drops thereof did softly due her wounds that unto strength restored her soon anew tho when they both recovered were right well he gan of them inquire what evil guide them thither brought and how their harms befell to whom they told all that did them betide and how from thraldom vile they were untied of that same wicked carl by virgins hound whose bloody corpse they showed him there beside and eke his cave in which they both were bound at which he wondered much when all those signs he found and evermore he greatly did desire to know what virgin did them thence unbind and oft of them did earnestly inquire where was her wone and how he mote her find but when as nought according to his mind he could outlearn he them from ground did rear no service loathsome to a gentle kind and on his warlike beast them both did bear himself by them on foot to succour them from fear so when that forest they had passed well a little cottage far away they spied to which they drew ere night upon them fell and entering in found none therein abide but one old woman sitting there beside upon the ground in ragged rude attire with filthy locks about her scattered wide gnawing her nails for fellness and for ire and there out sucking venom to her parts entire a foul and loathly creature sure in sighed and in conditions to be loathed no less for she was stuffed with rancour and despite up to the throat that oft with bitterness it forth would break and gush in great excess pouring out streams of poison and of gall gainst all that truth or virtue do profess whom she with leasings lewdly did miscall and wickedly backbite her name men slander call her nature is all goodness to abuse and causeless crimes continually to frame with which she guiltless persons may accuse and steal away the crown of their goodname ne ever knight so bold ne ever dame so chaste and loyal lived but she would strive with forged cause them falsely to defame ne ever thing so well was done alive but she with blame would blot & of due praise deprive her words were not as common words are meant express the meaning of the inward mind but noisome breath and poisonous spirit sent from inward parts with cankered malice lined and breathed forth with blast of bitter wind which passing through the ears would pierce the heart and wound the soul it self with grief unkind for like the stings of asps that kill with smart her spiteful words did prick & wound the inner part such was that hag unmeet to host such guests whom greatest princes court would welcome fain but need that answers not to all requests bade them not look for better entertain and eke that age despised niceness vain enured to hardness and to homely fare which them to warlike discipline did train and manly limbs endured with little care against all hard mishaps and fortuneless misfare then all that evening welcomed with cold and cheerless hunger they together spent yet found no fault but that the hag did scold and rail at them with grudgeful discontent for lodging there without her own consent yet they endured all with patience mild and unto rest themselves all only lent regardless of that quean so base and vild to be unjustly blamed and bitterly reviled here well i ween when as these rhymes be read with misregard that some rash witted wight whose looser thought will lightly be misled these gentle ladies will misdeem too light for thus conversing with this noble knight sith now of days such temperance is rare and hard to find that heat of youthful spright for ought will from his greedy pleasure spare more hard for hungry steed abstain from pleasant lare but antique age yet in the infancy of time did live then like and innocent in simple truth and blameless chastity ne them of guile had made experiment but void of vile and treacherous intent held virtue for it self in sovereign awe then loyal love had royal regiment and each unto his lust did make a law from all forbidden things his liking to withdraw the lion there did with the lamb consort and eke the dove sat by the falcons side ne each of other feared fraud or tort but did in safe security abide withouten peril of the stronger pride but when the world wox old it wox war old whereof it hight and having shortly tried the trains of wit in wickedness wox bold and dared of all sins the secrets to unfold then beauty which was made to represent the great creators own resemblance bright unto abuse of lawless lust was lent and made the bait of bestial delight then fair grew foul and foul grew fair in sighed and that which wont to vanquish god and man was made the vassal of the victor's might then did her glorious flower wex dead and wan despised and trodden down of all that overran and now it is so utterly decayed that any bud thereof does scarce remain but if few plants preserved through heavenly aid in princes court do hap to sprout again dewed with her drops of bounty sovereign which from that goodly glorious flower proceed sprung of the ancient stock of princes strain now only remnant of that royal breed whose noble kind at first was sure of heavenly seed tho soon as day discovered heavens face to sinful men with darkness overdight this gentle crew gan from their eyelids chase the drowzy humour of the dampish night and did themselves unto their journey dight so forth they yode and forward softly paced that them to view had be and uncouth sighed how all the way the prince on footpace traced the ladies both on horse together fast embraced soon as they thence departed were afore that shameful hag the slander of her sex them followed fast and them reviled soar him calling these them whores that much did vex his noble heart thereto she did annex false crimes and facts such as they never meant that those two ladies much ashamed did wax the more did she pursue her lewd intent and railed and raged till she had all her poison spent at last when they were passed out of sighed yet she did not her spiteful speech forbear but after them did bark and still backbite though there were none her hateful words to hear like as a cur does felly bite and tear the stone which passed stranger at him threw so she them seeing passed the reach of ear against the stones and trees did rail anew till she had dulled the sting which in her tongue's end grew they passing forth kept on their ready way with easy steps so soft as foot could stride both for great feeblesse which did oft assay fair amoret that scarcely she could ride and eke through heavy arms which soar annoyed the prince on foot not wonted so to fare whose steady hand was feign his steed to guide and all the way from trotting hard to spare so was his toil the more the more that was his care at length they spied where towards them with speed a squire came galloping as he would fly bearing a little dwarf before his steed that all the way full loud for aid did cry that seemed his shrieks would rend the brazen sky whom after did a mighty man pursue riding upon a dromedar on high of stature huge and horrible of hew that would have mazed a man his dreadful face to view for from his fearful eyes two fiery beams more sharp then points of needles did proceed shooting forth far away two flaming streams full of sad pour that poisonous bale did breed to all that on him looked without good heed and secretly his enemies did slay like as the basilisk of serpents seed from powerful eyes close venom does convey into the lookers heart and kills far away he all the way did rage at that same squire and after him full many threatenings threw with curses vain in his avengeful ire but none of them so fast away he flew him overtook before he came in view where when he saw the prince in armour bright he called to him aloud his case to rew and rescue him through succour of his might from that his cruel foe that him pursued in sighed eftsoones the prince took down those ladies twaine from lofty steed and mounting in their stead came to that squire yet trembling every vain of whom he gan inquire his cause of dread who as he gan the same to him aread lo hard behind his back his foe was pressed with dreadful weapon aimed at his head that unto death had done him unredressed had not the noble prince his ready stroke repressed who thrusting boldly betwixt him and the blow the burden of the deadly brunt did bear upon his shield which lightly he did throw over his head before the harm came near natheless it fell with so despiteous drear and heavy sway that hard unto his crown the shield it drove and did the covering rear therewith both squire and dwarf did tumble down unto the earth and lay long while in senseless swown whereat the prince full wrath his strong right hand in full avengement heaved up on high and stroke the pagan with his steely brand so soar that to his saddle bow thereby he bowed low and so a while did lie and sure had not his massy iron mace betwixt him and his hurt be happily it would have cleft him to the girding place yet as it was it did astonish him long space but when he to himself returned again all full of rage he gan to curse and swear and vow by mahoune that he should be slain with that his murderous mace he up did rear that seemed nought the souse thereof could bear and therewith smote at him with all his might but ere that it to him approached near the royal child with ready quick foresight did shun the proof thereof and it avoided light but ere his hand he could recure again to ward his body from the baleful stound he smote at him with all his might and main so furiously that ere he wist he found his head before him tumbling on the ground the while his babbling tongue did yet blaspheme and curse his god that did him so confound the while his life ran forth in bloody stream his soul descended down into the stygian ream which when that squire beheld he wox full glad to see his foe breath out his spright in vain but that same dwarf right sorry seemed and sad and howled aloud to see his lord there slain and rend his hair and scratched his face for pain then gan the prince at leisure to inquire of all the accident there happened plain and what he was whose eyes did flame with fire all which was thus to him declared by that squire this mighty man quoth he whom you have slain of and huge giantess whilom was bred and by his strength rule to himself did gain of many nations into thraldom led and mighty kingdoms of his force dreaded whom yet he conquered not by bloody fight ne hosts of men with banners broad dispread but by the pour of his infectious sighed with which he killed all that came within his might ne was he ever vanquished afore but ever vanquished all with whom he fought ne was there man so strong but he down boar ne woman yet so fair but he her brought unto his bay and captived her thought for most of strength and beauty his desire was spoil to make and wast them unto nought by casting secret flakes of lustful fire from his false eyes into their hearts and parts entire therefore corflambo was he called aright though nameless there his body now does lie yet hath he left one daughter that is hight the fair poeana who seems outwardly so fair as ever yet saw living eye and were her virtue like her beauty bright she were as fair as any under sky but ah she given is to vain delight and eke too lose of life and eke of love too light so as it fell there was a gentle squire that loved a lady of high parentage but for his mean degree might not aspire to match so high her friends with counsel sage dissuaded her from such a disparage but she whose heart to love was wholly lent out of his hands could not redeem her gage but firmly following her first intent resolved with him to weened gainst all her friends consent so betwixt themselves they pointed time and place to which when he according did repair and hard mishap and disadventurous case him chanced in stead of his aemylia fair this giants son that lies there on the lair and headless heap him unawares there caught and all dismayed through merciless despair him wretched thrall unto his dungeon brought where he remains of all unsuccoured and unsought this giants daughter came upon a day unto the prison in her joyous glee to view the thralls which there in bondage lay among the rest she chanced there to see this lovely swain the squire of low degree to whom she did her liking lightly cast and wooed him her paramour to be from day to day she wooed and prayed him fast and for his love him promised liberty at last he though affied unto a former love to whom his faith he firmly meant to hold yet seeing not how thence he mote remove but by that means which fortune did unfold her granted love but with affection cold to win her grace his liberty to get yet she him still detains in captive hold fearing lest if she should him freely set he would her shortly leave and former love forget yet so much favour she to him hath hight above the rest that he sometime may space and walk about her gardens of delight having a keeper still with him in place which keeper is this dwarf her darling base to whom the keys of every prison door by her committed be of special grace and at his will may whom he list restore and whom he list reserve to be afflicted more whereof when tidings came unto mine ear full inly sorry for the fervent zeal which i to him as to my soul did bear i thither went where i did long conceal my self till that the dwarf did me reveal and told his dame her squire of low degree did secretly out of her prison steal for me he did mistake that squire to be for never two so like did living creature see then was i taken and before her brought who through the likeness of my outward hew being likewise beguiled in her thought gan blame me much for being so untrue to seek by flight her fellowship t'eschew that loved me deer as dearest thing alive thence she commanded me to prison new whereof i glad did not gainsay nor strive but suffered that same dwarf me to her dungeon driven there did i find mine only faithful friend in heavy plighted and sad perplexity whereof i sorry yet my self did bend him to recomfort with my company but him the more aggrieved i found thereby for all his joy he said in that distress was mine and his aemylias liberty aemylia well he loved as i mote guess yet greater love to me then her he did profess but i with better reason him advised and showed him how through error and misthought of our like persons eath to be disguised or his exchange or freedom might be wrought whereto full loath was he ne would for ought consent that i who stood all fearless free should wilfully be into thraldom brought till fortune did perforce it so decree yet overruled at last he did to me agree the morrow next about the wonted hour the dwarf called at the door of amyas to come forthwith unto his ladies bower in steed of whom forth came i placidas and undiscerned forth with him did pass there with great joyance and with gladsome glee of fair poeana i received was and oft embraced as if that i were he and with kind words accoyed vowing great love to me which i that was not bent to former love as was my friend that had her long refused did well accept as well it did behoove and to the present need it wisely used my former hardness first i fair excused and after promised large amends to make with such smooth terms her error i abused to my friends good more then for mine own sake for whose sole liberty i love and life did stake thenceforth i found more favour at her hand that to her dwarf which had me in his charge she bade to lighten my too heavy band and grant more scope to me to walk at large so on a day as by the flowery marge of a fresh stream i with that elf did play finding no means how i might us enlarge but if that dwarf i could with me convey i lightly snatched him up and with me boar away thereat he shrieked aloud that with his cry the tyrant self came forth with yelling bray and me pursued but nathemore would i forgo the purchase of my got prey but have perforce him hither brought away thus as they talked lo where nigh at hand those ladies two yet doubtful through dismay in presence came desirous understand tidings of all which there had happened on the land where soon as sad aemylia did espy her captive lovers friend young placidas all mindless of her wonted modesty she to him ran and him with straight embrace enfolding said and lives yet amyas he lives quoth he and his aemylia loves then less said she by all the woe i pass with which my weaker patience fortune proves but what mishap thus long him from my self removes then gan he all this story to renew and tell the course of his captivity that her deer heart full deeply made to rew and sighs full soar to hear the misery in which so long he merciless did lie then after many tears and sorrows spent she deer besought the prince of remedy who thereto did with ready will consent and well performed as shall appear by his event cant. ix the squire of low degree released poeana takes to wife britomart fights with many knights prince arthur stints their strife hard is the doubt and difficult to deem when all three kinds of love together meet and do dispart the heart with pour extreme whither shall weigh the balance down to weet the deer affection unto kindred sweet or raging fire of love to woman kind or zeal of friends combined with virtues meet but of them all the band of virtues mind me seems the gentle heart should most assured bind for natural affection soon does cease and quenched is with cupids greater flame but faithful friendship does them both suppress and them with mastering discipline does tame through thoughts aspiring to eternal fame for as the soul does rule the earthly mass and all the service of the body frame so love of soul does love of body pass no less then perfect gold surmounts the meanest brass all which who list by trial to assay shall in this story find approved plain in which these squires true friendship more did sway then either care of parents could refrain or love of fairest lady could constrain for though poeana were as fair as morn yet did this trusty squire with proud disdain for his friends sake her offered favours scorn and she her self her sire of whom she was born now after that prince arthur granted had to yield strong succour to that gentle swain who now long time had lyen in prison sad he gan advise how best he mote deraign that enterprise for greatest glories gain that headless tyrants trunk he reared from ground and having imped the head to it again upon his usual beast it firmly bound and made it so to ride as it alive was found then did he take that chased squire and laid before the rider as he captive were and made his dwarf though with unwilling aid to guide the beast that did his master bear till to his castle they approached near whom when the watch that kept continual ward saw coming home all void of doubtful fear he running down the gate to him unbarred whom straight the prince ensuing in together fared there he did find in her delicious bower the fair poeana playing on a rote complaining of her cruel paramour and singing all her sorrow to the note as she had learned readily by rote that with the sweetness of her rare delight the prince half rapt began on her to dote till better him bethinking of the right he her unwares attached and captive held by might whence being forth produced when she perceived her own deer sire she called to him for aid but when of him no answer she received but saw him senseless by the squire upstaid she weened well that then she was betrayed then gan she loudly cry and weep and wail and that same squire of treason to upbraid but all in vain her plaints might not prevail ne none there was to rescue her ne none to bail then took he that same dwarf and him compelled to open unto him the prison door and forth to bring those thralls which there he held thence forth were brought to him above a score of knights and squires to him unknown afore all which he did from bitter bondage free and unto former liberty restore among the rest that squire of low degree came forth full weak and wan not like him self to be whom soon as fair aemylia beheld and placidas they both unto him ran and him embracing fast betwixt them held striving to comfort him all that they can and kissing oft his visage pale and wan that fair paeana them beholding both gan both envy and bitterly to ban through jealous passion weeping inly wroth to see the sighed perforce that both her eyes were loath but when a while they had together been and diversely conferred of their case she though full oft she both of them had seen asunder yet not ever in one place began to doubt when she them saw embrace which was the captive squire she loved so deer deceived through great likeness of their face for they so like in person did appear that she uneath discerned whither whither wear and eke the prince when as he them advised their like resemblance much admired there and mazed how nature had so well disguised her work and counterfeit her self so never as if that by one pattern seen somewhere she had them made a paragon to be or whither it through skill or error were thus gazing long at them much wondered he so did the other knights and squires which him did see then gan they ransack that same castle strong in which he found great store of hoarded treasure the which that tyrant gathered had by wrong and tortious pour without respect or measure upon all which the briton prince made seizure and afterwards continued there a while to rest him self and solace in soft pleasure those weaker ladies after weary toil to whom he did divide part of his purchased spoil and for more joy that captive lady fair the fair paeana he enlarged free and by the rest did set in sumptuous chair to feastand frolic nathemore would she show gladsome countenance nor pleasant glee but grieved was for loss both of her sire and eke of lordship with both land and fee but most she touched was with grief entire for loss of her new love the hope of her desire but her the prince through his well wonted grace to better terms of mildness did entreat from that fowl rudeness which did her deface and that same bitter corrosive which did eat her tender heart and made refrain from meat he with good thews and speeches well applied did mollify and calm her raging heat for though she were most fair and goodly died yet she it all did mar with cruelty and pride and for to shut up all in friendly love sith love was first the ground of all her grief that trusty squire he wisely well did move not to despise that dame which loved him lief till he had made of her some better proof but to accept her to his wedded wife thereto he offered for to make him chief of all her land and lordship during life he yielded and her took so stinted all their strife from that day forth in peace and joyous bliss they lived together long without debate ne private jar ne spite of enemies could shake the safe assurance of their state and she whom nature did so fair create that she mote match the fairest of her days yet with lewd loves and lust intemperate had it defaced thenceforth reformed her ways that all men much admired her change and spoke her praise thus when the prince had perfectly compiled these pairs of friends in peace and settled rest him self whose mind did travel as with child of his old love conceived in secret breast resolved to pursue his former guest and taking leave of all with him did bear fair amoret whom fortune by bequest had left in his protection whilere exchanged out of one into and other fear fear of her safety did her not constrain for well she wist now in a mighty hound her person late in peril did remain who able was all dangers to withstand but now in fear of shame she more did stand seeing her self all solely succourless left in the victor's pour like vassal bound whose will her weakness could no way repress in case his burning lust should break into excess but cause of fear sure had she none at all of him who goodly learned had of yore the course of lose affection to forestall and lawless lust to rule with reasons lore that all the while he by his side her boar she was as safe as in a sanctuary thus many miles they two together wore to seek their loves dispersed diversely yet neither showed to other their hearts privity at length they came whereas a troop of knights they saw together skirmishing as seemed sixe they were all all full offell despite but foure of them the battle best beseemed that which of them was best mote not be deemed those foure were they from whom false florimell by braggadochio lately was redeemed to weet stern druon and lewd claribell love-lavish blandamour and lustful paridell druons delight was all in single life and unto ladies love would lend no leisure the more was claribell enraged rise with fervent flames and loved out of measure so eke loved blandamour but yet at pleasure would change his liking and new leman's prove but paridell of love did make no treasure but lusted after all that him did move so diversely these foure disposed were to love but those two other which beside them stood were britomart and gentle scudamour who all the while beheld their wrathful mood and wondered at their impacable stour whose like they never saw till that same hour so dreadful strokes each did at other driven and laid on load with all their might and pour as if that every dint the ghost would rive out of their wretched corpses and their lives deprive as when dan aeolus in great displeasure for loss of his deer love by neptune hent sends forth the winds out of his hidden treasure upon the sea to wreak his fell intent they breaking forth with rude unruliment from all foure parts of heaven do rage full soar and toss the deeps and tear the firmament and all the world confound with wide uproar as if in stead thereof they chaos would restore cause of their discord and so fell debate was for the love of that same snowy maid whom they had lost in tournament of late and seeking long to weet which way she strayed met here together where through lewd upbraid of ate and duessa they fell out and each one taking part in others aid this cruel conflict raised thereabouts whose dangerous success depended yet in doubt for sometime paridell and blandamour the better had and bet the others back eftsoons the others did the field recover and on their foes did work full cruel wrack yet neither would their fiendlike fury slack but evermore their malice did augment till that uneath they forced were for lack of breath their raging rigour to relent and rest themselves for to recover spirits spent their gan they change their sides and new parts take for paridell did take to druons side for old despite which now forth newly brake gainst blandamour whom always he envied and blandamour to claribell relied so all afresh gan former fight renew as when two barks this carried with the tide that with the wind contrary courses sew if wind and tide do change their courses change anew thenceforth they much more furiously gan fare as if but then the battle had begun ne helmets bright ne hauberks strong did spare that through the cliffs the vermeil blood out spun and all adown their riven sides did run such mortal malice wonder was to see in friends professed and so great outrage done but sooth is said and tried in each degree faint friends when they fallen out most cruel foemen be thus they long while continued in fight till scudamour and that same briton maid by fortune in that place did chance to light whom soon as they with wrathful eye bewrayed they gan remember of the fowl upbraid the which that britonesse had to them done in that late turney for the snowy maid where she had them both shamefully fordone and eke the famous prize of beauty from them won eftsoones all burning with a fresh desire of fell revenge in their malicious mood they from them selves gan turn their furious ire and cruel blades yet steeming with hot blood against those two let driven as they were wood who wondering much at that so sudden fit yet nought dismayed them stoutly well withstood ne yielded foot ne once aback did flit but being doubly smitten likewise doubly smit the warlike dame was on her part assayed of claribell and blandamour atone and paridell and druon fiercely laid at scudamour both his professed foes foure charged two and two surcharged one yet did those two them selves so bravely bear that the other little gained by the lone but with their own repaired duly wear and usury withal such gain was got deer full oftentimes did britomart assay to speak to them and some emparlance move but they for nought their cruel hands would stay ne lend and ear to ought that might behoove as when and eager mastiff once does prove the taste of blood of some engored beast no words may rate nor rigour him remove from greedy hold of that his bloody feast so little did they harken to her sweet behest whom when the briton prince a far beheld with ods of so unequal match oppressed his mighty heart with indignation fweld and inward grudge filled his heroic breast eftsoons him self he to their aid addressed and thrusting fierce into the thickest press divided them how ever loath to rest and would them feign from battle to surcease with gentle words persuading them to friendly peace but they so far from peace or patience were that all at once at him gan fiercely fly and lay on load as they him down would bear like to astorme which hovers under sky long here and there and round about does sty at length breaks down in rain and hail and sleet first from one coast till nought thereof be dry and then another till that likewise fleet and so from side to side till all the world it weet but now their forces greatly were decayed the prince yet being fresh untouched afore who them with speeches mild gan first dissuade from such foul outrage and them long forbore till seeing them through sufferance heartened more him self he bent their furies to abate and laid at them so sharply and so soar that shortly them compelled to retreat and being brought in danger to relent too late but now his courage being thoroughly fired he meant to make them know their follies prize had not those two him instantly desired assuage his wrath and pardon their misprise at whose request he gan him self advise to stay his hand and of a truce to treat in milder terms as list them to devise amongst which the cause of their so cruel heat he did them ask who all that passed gan repeat and told at large how that same errant knight to weet fair britomart them late had foiled in open turney and by wrongful fight both of their public praise had them despoiled and also of their private loves beguiled of two full hard to read the harder theft but she that wrongful challenge soon assoiled and showed that she had not that lady reft as they supposed but her had to her liking left to whom the prince thus goodly well replied certes sir knight you seem much to blame to rip up wrong that battle once hath tried wherein the honour both of arms you shame and eke the love of ladies foul defame to whom the world this franchise ever yielded that of their loves choice they might freedom claim and in that right should by all knights be shielded gainst which me seems this war you wrongfully have wielded and yet quoth she a greater wrong remains for i thereby my former love have lost whom seeking ever since with endless pains hath me much sorrow and much travel cost aye me to see that gentle maid so tossed but scudamour then sighing deep thus said certes her loss ought me to sorrow most whose right she is where ever she be strayed through many perils won and many fortune's weighed for from the first that i her love professed unto this hour this present luckless hour i never joyed happiness nor rest but thus turmoiled from one to other stour i wast my life and do my days devour in wretched anguish and incessant woe passing the measure of my feeble pour that living thus a wretch i and loving so i neither can my love ne yet my life forgo then good sir claribell him thus bespoke now were it not sir scudamour to you dislikeful pain so sad a task to take mote we entreat you sith this gentle crew is now so well accorded all anew that as we ride together on our way you will recount to us in order due all that adventure which you did assay for that fair ladies love past perils well apay so gan the rest him likewise to require but britomart did him importune hard to take on him that pain whose great desire he glad to satisfy him self prepared to tell through what misfortune he had fared in that achievement as to him befell and all those dangers unto them declared which sith they cannot in this canto well comprised be i will them in another tell cant. x. scudamour does his conqust tell of virtuous amoret great venus temple is described and lovers life forth set true he it said what ever man it said that love with gall and honey does abound but if the one be with the other weighed for every dram of honey therein found a pound of gall does over it redound that i too true by trial have approved for since the day that first with deadly wound my heart was launched and learned to have loved i never joyed hour but still with care was moved and yet such grace is given them from above that all the cares and evil which they meet may nought at all their settled minds remove but seem gainst common sense to them most sweet as boasting in their martyrdom unmeet so all that ever yet i have endured i count as nought and tread down under feet since of my love at length i rest assured that to disloyalty she will not be allured long were to tell the travel and long toil through which this shield of love i late have won and purchased this peerless beauty's spoil that harder may be ended then begun but since you so desire your will be done then hark you gentle knights and ladies free my hard mishaps that you may learn to shun for though sweet love to conquer glorious bee yet is the pain thereof much greater then the fee what time the fame of this renowned prize flew first abroad and all men's ears possessed i having arms then taken gan avise to win me honour by some noble gest and purchase me some place among the best i boldly thought so young men's thoughts are bold that this same brave emprise for me did rest and that both shield and she whom i behold might be my lucky lot sith all by lot we hold so on that hard adventure forth i went and to the place of peril shortly came that was a temple fair and ancient which of great mother venus bore the name and far renowned through exceeding fame much more then that which was in paphos built or that in cyprus both long since this same though all the pillars of the one were gilded and all the others pavement were with ivory spilled and it was seated in and island strong abounding all with delices most rare and walled by nature gainst invaders wrong that none mote have access nor inward fare but by one way that passage did prepare it was a bridge built in goodly wise with curious corbes and pendants graven fair and arched all with porches did arise on stately pillars framed after the doric guise and for defence thereof on th'other end there reared was a castle fair and strong that warded all which in or out did weened and flanked both the bridges sides along gainst all that would it feign to force or wrong and therein woned twenty valiant knights all twenty tried in wars experience long whose office was against all nanner wights by all means to maintain that castles ancients rights before that castle was and open plain and in the midst thereof a pillar placed on which this shield of many sought in vain the shield of love whose guerdon me hath graced was hanged on high with golden ribbons laced and in the marble stone was written this with golden letters goodly well enchased blessed the man that well can use his bliss whose ever be the shield fair amoret be his which when i read my heart did inly earn and pant with hope of that adventures hap ne stayed further news thereof to learn but with my spear upon the shield did rap that all the castle ringed with the clap straight forth issued a knight all armed to proof and bravely mounted to his most mishap who staying nought to question from aloof ran fierce at me that fire glanced from his horses hoof whom boldly i encountered as i could and by good fortune shortly him unseated eftsoones out sprung two more of equal mould but i them both with equal hap defeated so all the twenty i likewise entreated and left them groaning there upon the plain then pressing to the pillar i repeated the read thereof for guerdon of my pain and taking down the shield with me did it retain so forth without impediment i passed till to the bridges utter gate i came the which i found sure locked and chained fast i knocked but no man answered me by name i called but no man answered to my claim yet i persevered still to knock and call till at the last i spied within the same where one stood peeping through a crevice small to whom i called aloud half angry therewithal that was to weet the porter of the place unto whose trust the charge thereof was lent his name was doubt that had a double face th'one forward looking th'other backward bent therein resembling ianus ancient which hath in charge the ingate of the year and evermore his eyes about him went as if some proved peril he did fear or did misdoubt some ill whose cause did not appear on th'one side he on th'other sat delay behind the gate that none her might espy whose manner was all passengers to stay and entertain with her occasions sly through which some lost great hope unheedily which never they recover might again and others quite excluded forth did lie long languishing there in unpitied pain and seeking often entrance afterwards in vain me when as he had privily espied bearing the shield which i had conquered late he kenned it straight and to me opened wide so in i passed and straight he closed the gate but being in delay in close await caught hold on me and thought my steps to stay feigning full many a found excuse to prate and time to steal the treasure of men day whose smallest minute lost no riches render may but by no means my way i would forslow for ought that ever she could do or say but from my lofty steed dismounting low passed forth on foot beholding all the way the goodly works and stones of rich assay cast into sundry shapes by wondrous skill that like on earth no where i reckon may and underneath the river rolling still with murmur soft that seemed to serve the workman's will thence forth i passed to the second gate the gate of good desert whose goodly pride and costly frame were long here to relate the same to all stood always open wide but in the porch did evermore abide and hideous giant dreadful to behold that stopped the entrance with his spacious stride and with the terror of his countenance bold full many did affray that else feign enter would his name was danger dreaded over all who day and night did watch and duly ward from fearful cowards entrance to forestall and faint-heart-fools whom show of peril hard could terrify from fortune's fair adward for oftentimes faint hearts at first espial of his grim face were from approaching scared unworthy they of grace whom one denial excludes from fairest hope withouten further trial yet many doughty warriors often tried in greater perils to bestout and bold durst not the sternness of his look abide but soon as they his countenance did behold began to faint and feel their courage cold again some other that in hard assays were cowards known and little count did hold either through gifts or guile or such like ways crept in by stooping low or stealing of the keys but i though nearest man of many more yet much disdaining unto him to lout or creep between his legs so in to go resolved him to assault with manhood stout and either beatrice him in or driven him out eftsoones advancing that enchanted shield with all my might i gan to lay about which when he saw the glaive which he did wield he gan forthwith avail and way unto me yield so as i entered i did backward look for fear of harm that might lie hidden there and lo his hindparts whereof heed i took much more deformed fearful ugly were then all his former parts did erst appear for hatred murder treason and despite with many more lay in ambushment there awaiting to entrap the wareless wight which did not them prevent with vigilant foresight thus having passed all peril i was come within the compass of that islands space the which did seem unto my simple doom the only pleasant and delightful place that ever trodden was of footing's trace for all that nature by her mother wit could frame in earth and form of substance base was there and all that nature did omit art playing second nature's part supplied it no tree that is of count in green-wood grows from lowest juniper to cedar tall no flower in field that dainty odour throws and decks his branch with blossoms over all but there was planted or grew natural nor sense of man so coy and curious nice but there mote find to please it self withal nor heart could wish for any quaint device but there it present was and did frail sense entice in such luxurious plenty of all pleasure it seemed a second paradise to be so lavishly enriched with nature's treasure that if the happy souls which do possess elysian fields and live in lasting bless should happen this with living eye to see they soon would loath their lesser happiness and wish to life returned again to guess that in this joyous place they mote have joyance free fresh shadows fit to shroud from sunny ray fair lands to take the sun in season due sweet springs in which a thousand nymphs did play soft rambling brooks that gentle slumber drew high reared mounts the lands about to view low looking dales disloigned from common gaze delightful bowers to solace lovers true false labyrinths found runners eyes to daze all which by nature made did nature self amaze and all without were walks and all eyes dight with diverse trees enranged in even ranks and here and there were pleasant arbours pight and shady seats and sundry flowering banks to fit and rest the walker's weary shanks and therein thousand pairs of lovers walked praising their god and yielding him great thanks ne ever ought but of their true loves talked ne ever for rebuke or blame of any balked all these together by themselves did sport their spotless pleasures and sweet loves content but far away from these another sort of lovers linked in true hearts consent which loved not as these for like intent but on chaste virtue grounded their desire far from all fraud or feigned blandishment which in their spirits kindling zealous fire brave thoughts and noble deeds did evermore aspire such were great hercules and hyllus deer true ionathan and dauid trusty tried stout theseus and pirithous his fear pylades and orestes by his side mild titus and gesippus without pride damon and pythias whom death could not sever all these and all that ever had be tied in bans of friendship there did live for ever whose lives although decayed yet loves decayed never which when as i that never tasted bliss nor happy hour beheld with gazeful eye i thought there was none other heaven then this and gan their endless happiness envy that being free from fear and jealousy might frankly there their loves desire possess whilst i through pains and perilous jeopardy was forced to seek my life's deer patroness much dearer be the things which come through hard distress yet all those sights and all that else i saw might not my steps withhold but that forthright unto that purposed place i did me draw where as my love was lodged day and night the temple of great venus that is hight the queen of beauty and of love the mother there worshipped of every living wight whose goodly workmanship far passed all other that ever were on earth all were they set together not that same famous temple of diane whose hight all ephesus did oversee and which all asia sought with vows profane one of the world's seuen wonders said to be might match with this by many a degree nor that which that wise king of jury framed with endless cost to be th'almighties see nor all that else through all the world is nam to all the heathen gods might like to this be claimed i much admiring that so goodly frame unto the porch approached which open stood but therein sat and amiable dame that seemed to be of very sober mood and in her semblant showed great womanhood strange was her tyre for on her head a crown she wore much like unto a danish hood powdered with pearl and stone and all her gown enwoven was with gold that taught full low a down on either side of her two young men stood both strongly armed as fearing one another yet were they brothers both of half the blood begotten by two father's of one mother though of contrary nature's each to other the one of them hight love the other hate hate was the elder love the younger brother yet was the younger stronger in his state then elder and him mastered still in all debate natheless that dame so well them tempted both that she them forced hand to join in hand albe that hatred was thereto full loath and turned his face away as he did stand unwilling to behold that lovely band yet she was of such grace and virtuous might that her commandment he could notwithstand but bit his lip for felonous despite and gnashed his iron tusks at that displeasing sighed concord she cleped was in common reed mother of blessed peace and friendship true they both her twins both born of heavenly seed and she her self likewise divinely grew the which right well her works divine did snowed for strength and wealth and happiness she lends and strife and war and anger does subdue of little much of foes she makes friends and to afflicted minds sweet rest and quiet sends by her the heaven is in his course contained and all the world in state unmoved stands as their almighty maker first ordained and bound them with inviolable bans else would the waters overflow the lands and fire devour the air and hell them quite but that she holds them with her blessed hands she is the nurse of pleasure and delight and unto venus grace the gate does open right by her i entering half dismayed was but she in gentle wise me entertained and betwixt her self and love did let me pass but hatred would my entrance have restrained and with his club me threatened to have brained had not the lady with her powerful speech him from his wicked will uneath refrained and th'other eke his malice did impeach till i was thoroughly passed the peril of his reach into the inmost temple thus i came which fuming all with frankincense i found and odours rising from the altars flame upon and hundred marble pillars round the roose up high was reared from the ground all decked with crowns & chains and garlands gay and thousand precious gifts worth many a pound the which sad lovers for their vows did pay and all the ground was strowed with flowers as fresh as may and hundred altars round about were set all flaming with their sacrifices fire that with the steam thereof die temple sweated which rolled in clouds to heaven did aspire and in them boar true lovers vows entire and eke and hundred brazen cauldrons bright to both in joy and amorous desire every of which was to a damosel hight for all the priests were damsels in soft linen dight right in the midst the goddess self did stand upon and altar of some costly mass whose substance was uneath to understand for neither precious stone nor dureful brass nor shining gold nor mouldering clay it was but much more rare and precious to esteem pure in aspect and like to crystal glass yet glass was not if one did rightly deem but being fair and brickle likest glass did seem but it in shape and beauty did excel all other idols which the heathen adore far passing that which by surpassing skill phidias did make in paphos isle of yore with which that wretched greek that life forlore did fallen in love yet this much fairer shined but covered with a slender veil afore and both her feet and legs together twined were with a snake whose head & tail were fast combined the cause why she was covered with a veil was hard to know for that her priests the same from peoples knowledge laboured to conceal but sooth it was not sure for womanish shame nor any blemish which the work mote blame but for they say she hath both kinds in one both male and female both under one name she sire and mother is her self alone begets and eke conceives ne needs other none and all about her neck and shoulders flew a flock of little loves and sports and joys with nimble wings of gold and purple hew whose shapes seemed not like to terrestrial boys but like to angels playing heavenly toys the whilst their eldest brother was away cupid their eldest brother he enjoys the wide kingdom of love with lordly sway and to his law compels all creatures to obey and all about her altar scattered lay great sorts of lovers piteously complaining some of their loss some of their loves delay some of their pride some paragons disdaining some fearing fraud some fraudulently feigning as every one had cause of good or ill among the rest some one through loves constraining tormented soar could not contain it still but thus brake forth that all the temple it did fill great venus queen of beauty and of grace the joy of gods and men that under sky dost fairest shine and most adorn thy place that with thy smiling look dost pacify the raging seas and makest the storms to fly thee goddess thee the winds the clouds do fear and when thou spreadest thy mantle forth on high the waters play and pleasant lands appear and heavens laugh & all the world shows joyous cheer then does the daedale earth throw forth to thee out of her fruitful lap abundant flowers and then all living wights soon as they see the spring break forth out of his lusty bowers they all do learn to play the paramours first do the merry birds thy pretty pages privily pricked with thy lustful powers chirp loud to thee out of their leafy cages and thee their mother call to cool their kindly rages then do the salvage beasts begin to play their pleasant frisk's and loath their wanted food the lyons roar the tigers loudly bray the raging bulls rebellow through the wood and breaking forth dare tempt the deepest flood to come where thou dost draw them with desire so all things else that nourish vital blood soon as with fury thou dost them inspire in generation seek to quench their inward fire so all the world by thee at first was made and daily yet thou dost the same repair ne ought on earth that merry is and glad ne ought on earth that lovely is and fair but thou the same for pleasure didst prepare thou art the root of all that joyous is great god of men and women queen of the mother of laughter and wellspring of bliss oh grant that of my love at last i may not miss so did he say but i with murmur soft that none might hear the sorrow of my heart yet inly groaning deep and sighing oft besought her to grant ease unto my smart and to my wound her gracious help impart whilst thus i spoke behold with happy eye i spied where at the idols feet apart a bevy of fair damsels close did lie waiting when as the anthem should be sung on high the first of them did seem of riper years and graver countenance then all the rest yet all the rest were eke her equal pears yet unto her obeyed all the best her name was vvomanhood that she expressed by her sad semblant and demeanour wise for steadfast still her eyes did fixed rest ne roved at random after gazers guise whose luring baits oftimes do heedless hearts entice and next to her sat goodly shamefastness ne ever durst her eyes from ground uprear ne ever once did look up from her desk as if some blame of evil she did fear that in her cheeks made roses oft appear and her against sweet cheerfulness was placed whose eyes like twinkling stars in evening clear were decked with smiles that all sad humours chased and darted forth delights the which her goodly graced and next to her sat sober modesty holding her hand upon her gentle heart and her against sat comely courtesy that unto every person knew her part and her before was seated overthwart soft silence and submiss obedience both linked together never to dispart both gifts of god not got but from thence both girlands of his saints against their foes offence thus sat they all a round in seemly rate and in the midst of them a goodly maid even in the lap of vvomanhood there sat the which was all in lily white arrayed with silver streams among the linen strayed like to the morn when first her shining face hath to the gloomy world it self bewrayed that same was fairest amoret in place shining with beauty's light and heavenly virtues grace whom soon as i beheld my heart gan throb and wade in doubt what best were to be done for sacrilege me seemed the church to rob and folly seemed to leave the thing undone which with so strong attempt i had begun tho shaking off all doubt and shamefast fear which ladies love i herd had never won monest men of worth i to her stepped near and by the lily hand her laboured up to rear thereat that foremost matron me did blame and sharp rebuke for being over bold saying it was to knight unseemly shame upon a recluse virgin to lay hold that unto venus services was sold to whom i thus nay but it fits best for cupids man with venus maid to hold for ill your goddess services are dressed by virgins and her sacrifices let to rest with that my shield i forth to her did show which all that while i closely had concealed on which when cupid with his killing bow and cruel shafts emblazoned she beheld at sighed thereof she was with terror quelled and said no more but i which all that while the pledge of faith her hand engaged held like wary hind within the weedy soil for no intreaty would forgo so glorious spoil and evermore upon the goddess face mine eye was fixed for fear of her offence whom when i saw with amiable grace to laugh at me and favour my pretence i was emboldened with more confidence and nought for niceness nor for envy sparing in presence of them all forth led her thence all looking on and like astonished staring yet to lay hand on her not one of all them daring she often prayed and often me besought sometime with tender tears to let her go sometime with witching smiles but yet for nought that ever she to me could say or do could she her wished freedom from me woo but forth i led her through the temple gate by which i hardly past with much ado but that same lady which me friended late in entrance did me also friend in my retreat no less did danger threaten me with dread when as he saw me maugre all his pour that glorious spoil of beauty with me led then cerberus when orpheus did recover his leman from the stygian princes bower but evermore my shield did me defend against the storm of every dreadful stour thus safely with my love i thence did weened so ended he his tale where i this canto end cant. xi marinells former wound is healed he comes to proteus hall where thames does the medway wed and feasts the seagods all but ah for pity that i have thus long left a fair lady languishing in pain now well away that i have done such wrong to let fair florimell in bans remain in bans of love and in sad thraldom's chain from which unless some heavenly pour her free by miracle not yet appearing plain she longer yet is like captived to be that even to think thereof it inly pities me here need you to remember how erewhile unlovely proteus missing to his mind that virgins love to win by wit or wile her threw into a dungeon deep and blind and there in chains her cruelly did bind in hope thereby her to his bent to draw for when as neither gifts nor graces kind her constant mind could move at all he saw he thought her to compel by cruelty and awe deep in the bottom of and huge great rock the dungeon was in which her bound he left that neither iron bars nor brazen lock did need to guard from force or secret theft of all her lovers which would her have rest for walled it was with waves which raged and roared as they the cliff in pieces would have cleft beside ten thousand monsters foul abhorred did wait about it gaping grisly all begored and in the midst thereof did horror dwell and darkness dreaded that never viewed day like to the baleful house of lowest hell in which old styx her aged bones always old styx the gramdame of the gods does lay there did this luckless maid three months abide ne ever evening saw ne morning's ray ne ever from the day the night descried but thought it all one night that did no hours divide and all this was for love of marinell who her despised ah who would her despise and women's love did from his heart expel and all those joys that weak mankind entice natheless his pride full dearly he did prise for of a woman's hand it was wreaked that of the wound he yet in languor lies ne can be cured of that cruel stroke which britomart him gave when he did her provoke yet far and near the nymph his mother sought and many salves did to his soar apply and many herbs did use but when as nought she saw could ease his rankling malady at last to tryphon she for help did high this tryphon is the seagods' surgeon hight whom she besought to find some remedy and for his pains a whistle him behight that of a fish shell was wrought with rare delight so well that leach did hark to her request and did so well employ his careful pain that in short space his hurts he had redressed and him restored to healthful state again in which he long time after did remain there with the nymph his mother like her thrall who soar against his will did him retain for fear of peril which to him mote fallen through his too venturous prowess proved over all it fortuned then a solemn feast was there to all the seagods and their fruitful seed in honour of the spousals which then were betwixt the medway and the thames agreed long had the thames as we in records reed before that day her wooed to his bed but the proud nymph would for no worldly meed nor no entreaty to his love be led till now at last relenting she to him was wed so both agreed that this their bridal feast should for the gods in proteus house be made to which they all repaired both most and least aswell which in the mighty ocean trade as that in rivers swim or brooks do wade all which not if and hundred tongues to tell and hundred mouths and voice of brass i had and endless memory that mote excel in order as they came could i recount them well help therefore oh thou sacred imp of ioue the nursling of dame

which then assembled were to that great banquet of the watery gods and all their sundry kinds and all their hid abodes first came great neptune with his threeforked mace that rules the seas and makes them rise or fallen his dewy locks did drop with brine apace under his diadem imperial and by his side his queen with coronal fair amphitrite most divinely fair whose ivory shoulders weren covered all as with a robe with her own silver hair and decked with pearls which th'indian seas for her prepare these marched far afore the other crew and all the way before them as they went triton his trumpet shrill before them blew for goodly triumph and great jolliment that made the rocks to roar as they were rend and after them the royal issue came which of them sprung by lineal descent first the seagods which to themselves do claim the pour to rule the billows and the waves to tame phorcys the father of that fatal brood by whom those old heroes won such fame and glaucus that wise soothsays understood and tragic inoes son the which became a god of seas through his mad mother's blame now hight palemon and is sailors friend great brontes and astraeus that did shame himself with incest of

the rest phoenix and aon and pelasgus old great belus phoeax and agenor best and mighty albion father of the bold and warlike people which the britaine islands hold for albion the son of neptune was who for the proof of his great puissance out of his albion did on dryfoot pass into old gall that now is cleped france to fight with hercules that did advance to vanquish all the world with matchless might and there his mortal part by great mischance was slain but that which is th'immortall spright lives still and to this feast with neptunes seed was dight but what do i their names seek to rehearse which all the world have with their issue filled how can they all in this so narrow verse contained be and in small compass held let them record them that are better skilled and know the monuments of passed times only what needs shall be here fulfilled express some part of that great equipage which from great neptune do derive their parentage next came the aged ocean and his dame old tethys oldest two of all the rest for all the rest of those two parents came which afterwards both sea and land possessed of all which nereus eldest and the best did first proceed then which none more upright ne more sincere in word and deed professed most void of guile most free from fowl despite doing him self and teaching others to do right thereto he was expert in prophecies and could the leaden of the gods unfold through which when paris brought his famous prize the fair tindarid lass he him foretold that her all greece with many a champion bold should fetch again and finally destroy proud priams town so wise is nereus old and so well skilled natheless he takes great joy ofttimes amongst the wanton nymphs to sport and toy and after him the famous rivers came which do the earth enrich and beautify the fertile nile which creatures new does frame long rhodanus whose source springs from the sky fair ister flowing from the mountains high divine seaman der purpled yet with blood of greeks and trojans which therein did die pactolus glistering with his golden flood and tygris fierce whose streams of none may be withstood great ganges and immortal euphrates deep indus and

the which for sparing little cost or pains lose so immortal glory and so endless gains then was there herd a most celestial found of dainty music which did next ensue before the spouse that was arion crowned who playing on his harp unto him drew the ears and hearts of all that goodly crew that even yet the dolphin which him boar through the agaean seas from pirates view stood still by him astonished at his lore and all the raging seas for joy forgotten to roar so went he playing on the watery plain soon after whom the lovely bridegroom came the noble thamis with all his goodly train but him before there went as best became his ancient parents namely ancient thame but much more aged was his wife then he the ouze whom men do isis rightly name full weak and crooked creature seemed she and almost blind through eld that scarce her way could see therefore on either side she was sustained of two small grooms which by their names were hight the churne and charwell two small streams

all hoary and his beard all grey dewed with silver drops that trickled down always and eke he somewhat seemed to stoop afore with bowed back by reason of the load and ancient heavy burden which he

were that few could weenen whither they were false or true and on his head like to a coronet he wore that seemed strange to common view in which were many towers and castles set than it encompassed round as with a golden fret like as the mother of the gods they say in her great iron chariot wonts to ride when to loves palace she does take her way old cybele arrayed with pompous pride wearing a diadem embattled wide with hundred turrets like a turribant with such and one was thamis beautified that was to weet the famous troynouant in which her kingdoms throne is chiefly resiant and round about him many a pretty page attended duly ready to obey all little rivers which owe vassalage to him as to their lord and tribute pay the chalky kenet and the thetis grey the moorish coal and the soft sliding breane the wanton lee that oft does lose his way and the still darent in whose waters clean ten thousand fish play and deck his pleasant stream then came his neighbour floods which nigh

grudged at all ne storming humber though he looked stout but both him honoured as their principal and let their swelling waters low before him fallen there was the speedy tamar which divides the cornish and the devonish confines through both whose borders swiftly down it glides and meeting plim to plimmouth thence declines and dart nigh choked with sands of tinny mines but auon marched in more stately path proud of his adamants with which he shines and glisters wide as also of wondrous bath and bristow fair which on his waves he built hath and there came stour with terrible aspect bearing his sixe deformed heads on high that does his course through blandford plains direct and washes winborne meads in season dry next him went wylibourne with passage sly that of his wiliness his name does take and of him self does name the shire thereby and mole that like a nuzzling mole does make his way still under ground till thamis he overtake then came the rother decked all with woods

nene down softly slid and bounteous trent that in him self enseams both thirty sorts of fish and thirty sundry streams next these came tyne along whose stony bank that roman monarch built a brazen wall which mote the feebled britons strongly flank against the picts that swarmed over all which yet thereof gualseuer they do call and twede the limit betwixt logris land and albany and eden though but small yet often stained with blood of many a band of scots and english both that tined on his strand then came those sixe sad brothers like forlorn that whilom were as antique father's tell sixe valiant knights of one fair nymph born which did in noble deeds of arms excel and woned there where now yorke people dwell still vre swift werfe and oze the most of might high swale unquiet nide and troublous skell all whom a scythian king that humber hight slew cruelly and in the river drowned quite but past not long ere brutus warlike son locrinus them avenged and the same date which the proud humber unto them had done by equal dome repaid on his own pate for in the self same river where he late had drenched them he drowned him again and named the river of his wretched fate whose bad condition yet it does retain oft tossed with his storms which therein still remain these after came the stony shallow lone that to old loncaster his name does lend and following dee which britons longygone did call divine that does by chester tend and conway which out of his stream does send plenty of pearls to deck his dams withal and lindus that his pikes does most commend of which the ancient lincolne men do call all these together marched towards proteus hall ne thence the irish rivers absent were sith no less famous then the rest they be and join in neighbourhood of kingdom never why should they not likewise in love agree and joy likewise this solemn day to see they saw it all and present were in place though i them all according their degree cannot recount nor tell their hidden raze nor read the salvage countries through which they pace there was the liffy rolling down the lea the sandy slane the stony aubrian the spacious shenan spreading like a sea the pleasant boyne the fishy fruitful ban swift awniduff which of the english man is called black water and the liffar deep sad trowis that once his people overran strong allo tumbling from slewlogher steep and mulla mine whose waves i whilom taught to weep and there the three renowned brothers were which that great giant blomius begotten of the fair nymph rheusa wandering there one day as she to shun the season hot under slewbloome in shady grove was god this giant found her and by force deflowered whereof conceiving she in time forth brought these three fair sons which being thence forth poured in three great rivers ran and many countries scoured the first the gentle shure that making way by sweet clonmell adorns rich waterford the next the stubborn newre whose waters grey by fair kilkenny and rosseponte board the third the goodly barow which does hoard great heaps of salmons in his deep bosom all which long sundered do at last accord to join in one ere to the sea they come so flowing all from one all one at last become there also was the wide embayed mayre the pleasant bandon crowned with many a wood the spreading lee that like and island fair encloses cork with his divided flood and baleful oure late stained with english blood with many more whose names no tongue can tell all which that day in order seemly good did on the thamis attend and waited well to do their dueful service as to them befell then came the bride the lovely medua came clad in a vesture of unknown gear and uncouth fashion yet her well became that seemed like silver sprinkled here and there with glittering spangs that did like stars appear and waved upon like water chamelot to hide the metal which yet every where bewrayed it self to let men plainly wot it was no mortal work that seemed and yet was not her goodly locks adown her back did flow unto her waste with flowers bescattered the which ambrosial odours forth did throw to all about and all her shoulders spread as a new spring and likewise on her head a chapelet of sundry flowers she wore from under which the dewy humour shed did trickle down her hair like to the hoar congealed little drops which do the morn adore on her two pretty handmaidens did attend one called the theise the other called the crane which on her waited things amiss to mend and both behind upheld her spreading train under the which her feet appeared plain her silver feet fair washed against this day and her before there paced pages twaine both clad in colours like and like array the doune & eke the frith both which prepared her way and after these the sea nymphs marched all all goodly damsels decked with long green hair whom of their sire nereids men call all which the ocean's daughter to him bore the grey eyed doris all which fifty are all which she there on her attending had swift proto mild eucrate thetis fair soft spio sweet endore sao sad light doto wanton glauce and galene glad white hand eunica proud dynamene joyous thalia goodly amphitrite

seas when they do sorest rage cymodoce and stout autonoe and neso and eione well in age and seeming still to smile glauconome and she that hight of many hests polynome fresh alimeda decked with garland green hyponeo with salt bedewed wrists laomedia like the crystal sheen liagore much praised for wise behests and psamathe for her broad snowy breasts cymo eupompe and themiste just and she that virtue loves and vice detests euarna and menippe true in trust and nemertea learned well to rule her lust all these the daughters of old nereus were which have the sea in charge to them assigned to rule his tides and surges to uprear to bring forth storms or fast them to upbind and sailors save from wrecks of wrathful wind and yet beside three thousand more there were of oceans seed but ioues and phoebus kind the which in floods and fountains do appear and all mankind do nourish with their waters clear the which more eath it were for mortal wight to tell the sands or count the stars on high or ought more hard then think to reckon right but well i wot that these which i descry were present at this great solemnity and there among the rest the mother was of luckless marinell cymodoce which for my muse her self now tired has unto and other canto i will overpass cant. xii marin for love of florimell in languor wastes his life the nymph his mother gets her and gives to him for wife o what and endless work have i in hand to count the seas abundant progeny whose fruitful seed far passes those in land and also those which won in azure sky for much more eath to tell the stars on high albe they endless seem in estimation then to recount the seas posterity so fertile be the floods in generation so huge their numbers and so numberless their nation therefore the antique wizards well invented that venus of the foamy sea was bred for that the seas by her are most augmented witness th'exceeding fry which there are fed and wondrous shoal which may of none be read then blame me not if i have erred in count of gods of nymphs of rivers yet unread for though their numbers do much more surmount yet all those same were there which erst i did recount all those were there and many other more whose names and nations were too long to tell that proteus house they filled even to the door yet were they all in order as befell according their degrees disposed well among the rest was fair cymodoce the mother of unlucky marinell who thither with her came to learn and see the manner of the gods when they at banquet be but for he was half mortal being bred of mortal sire though of immortal womb he might not with immortal food be fed ne with th'eternall gods to banquet come but walked abroad and round about did room to view the building of that uncouth place that seemed unlike unto his earthly home where as he to and from by chance did trace there unto him betid a disadventurous case under the hanging of and hideous cliff he herd the lamentable voice of one that piteously complained her careful grief which never she before disclosed to none but to her self her sorrow did bemoan so feelingly her case she did complain that ruth it moved in the rocky stone and made it seem to feel her grievous pain and oft to groan with billows beating from the main though vain i see my sorrows to unfold and count my cares when none is nigh to hear yet hoping grief may lessen being told i will them tell though unto no man near for heaven that unto all lends equal ear is far from hearing of my heavy plighted and lowest hell to which i lie most near cares not what evils hap to wretched wight and greedy seas do in the spoil of life delight yet lo the seas i see by often beating do pierce the rocks and hardest marble wears but his hard rocky heart for no entreating will yield but when my piteous plaints he hears is hardened more with my abundant tears yet though he never list to me relent but let me waste in woe my wretched years yet will i never of my love repent but joy that for his sake i suffer prisonment and when my weary ghost with grief outworn by timely death shall win her wished rest let then this plaint unto his ears be born that blame it is to him that arms professed to let her die whom he might have redressed there did she pause enforced to give place unto the passion that her heart oppressed and after she had wept and wailed a space she gan afresh thus to renew her wretched case the gods of seas if any gods at all have care of right or ruth of wretches wrong by one or other way me woeful thrall deliver hence out of this dungeon strong in which i daily dying am too long and if you deem me death for loving one that loves not me then do it not prolong but let me die and end my days atone and let him live unloved or love him self alone but if that life you unto me decree then let me live as lovers ought to do and of my life's deer love beloved be and if he shall through pride your doom undo do you by duress him compel thereto and in this prison put him here with me one prison fittest is to hold us two so had i rather to be thrall then free such thraldom or such freedom let it surely be but o vain judgement and conditions vain the which the prisoner points unto the free the while i him condemn and deem his pain he where he list goes lose and laughs at me so ever lose so ever happy be but where so lose or happy that thou art know marinell that all this is for thee with that she wept and wailed as if her heart would quite have burst through great abundance of her smart all which complaint when marinell had herd and understood the cause of all her care to come of him for using her so hard his stubborn heart that never felt misfare was touched with soft remorse and pity rare that even for grief of mind he oft did groan and inly wish that in his pour it wear her to redress but since he means found none he could no more but her great misery bemoan thus while his stony heart with tender ruth was touched and mighty courage mollified dame venus son that tames stubborn youth with iron bit and makes him abide till like a victor on his back he ride into his mouth his mastering bridle threw that made him stoop till he did him bestride then gan he make him tread his steps anew and learn to love by learning lovers pains to rew now gan he in his grieved mind devise how from that dungeon he might her enlarge some while he thought by fair and humble wise to proteus self to sue for her discharge but then he feared his mother's former charge gainst women's love long given him in vain then gan he think perforce with sword and targe her forth to fetch and proteus to constrain but soon he gan such folly to forthink again then did he cast to steal her thence away and with him bear where none of her might know but all in vain for why he found no way to enter in or issue forth below for all about that rock the sea did flow and though unto his will she given were yet without ship or boat her thence to row he wist not how her thence away to bear and danger well he wist long to continue there at last when as no means he could invent back to him self he gan return the blame that was the author of her punishment and with vile curses and reproachful shame to damn him self by every evil name and deem unworthy or of love or life that had despised so chaste and fair a dame which him had sought through trouble & long strife yet had refused a god that her had sought to wife in this sad plighted he walked here and there and roamed round about the rock in vain as he had lost him self he wist not where oft listening if he mote her hear again and still bemoaning her unworthy pain like as and hind whose calf is fallen unwares into some pit where she him hears complain and hundred times about the pit side fares right sorrowfully mourning her bereaved cares and now by this the feast was thoroughly ended and every one gan homeward to resort which seeing marinell was soar offended that his departure thence should be so short and leave his love in that sea-walled fort yet durst he not his mother disobey but her attending in full seemly sort did march among the many all the way and all the way did inly mourn like one astray being returned to his mother's bower in solitary silence far from wight he gan record the lamentable stour in which his wretched love lay day and night for his deer sake that ill deserved that plighted the thought whereof empierced his heart so deep that of no worldly thing he took delight ne daily food did take ne nightly sleep but pined & mourned & languished and alone did weep that in short space his wonted cheerful hew gan fade and lively spirits deadened quite his cheek bones raw and eyepits hollow grew and brawny arms had lost their known might that nothing like himself he seemed in sighed ere long so weak of limb and sick of love he wox that longer he note stand upright but to his bed was brought and laid above like rueful ghost unable once to stir or move which when his mother saw she in her mind was troubled soar ne wist well what to ween ne could by search nor any means out find the secret cause and nature of his teen whereby she might apply some medicine but weeping day and night did him attend and mourned to see her loss before her eyes which grieved her more that she it could not mend to see and helpless evil double grief does lend nought could she read the root of his disease ne ween what mister malady it is whereby to seek some means it to appease most did she think but most she thought amiss that that same former fatal wound of his whilere by tryphon was not thoroughly healed but closely rankled under th'orifis lest did she think that which he most concealed that love it was which in his heart lay unrevealed therefore to tryphon she again does hast and him does chide as false and fraudulent that failed the trust which she in him had placed to cure her son as he his faith had lent who now was fallen into new languishment of his old hurt which was not thoroughly cured so back he came unto her patient where searching every part her well assured that it was no old soar which his new pain procured but that it was some other malady or grief unknown which he could not discern so left he her withouten remedy then gan her heart to faint and quake and earn and inly troubled was the truth to learn unto himself she came and him besought now with fair speeches now with threatenings stern if ought lay hidden in his grieved thought it to reveal who still her answered there was nought natheless she rested not so satisfied but leaving watery gods as booting nought unto the shiny heaven in haste she hide and thence apollo king of leaches brought apollo came who soon as he had sought through his disease did by and by out find that he did languish of some inward thought the which afflicted his engrieved mind which love he read to be that leads each living kind which when he had unto his mother told she gan thereat to fret and greatly grieve and coming to her son gan first to scold and chide at him that made her misbelieve but afterwards she gan him soft to shrieve and woo with fair intreaty to disclose which of the nymphs his heart so soar did move for sure she weened it was some one of those which he had lately seen that for his love he chosen now less she feared that same fatal read that warned him of women's love beware which being meant of mortal creatures seed for love of nymphs she thought she need not care but promised him what ever wight she wear that she her love to him would shortly gain so he her told but soon as she did hear that florimell it was which wrought his pain she gan a fresh to chafe and grieve in every vain yet since she saw the straight extremity in which his life unluckily was laid it was no time to scan the prophecy whither old proteus true or false had said that his decay should happen by a maid it's late in death of danger to advise or love forbid him that is life denied but rather gan in troubled mind devise how she that ladies liberty might enterprise to proteus self to sew she thought it vain who was the root and worker of her woe nor unto any meaner to complain but unto great king neptune self did go and on her knee before him falling low made humble suit unto his majesty to grant to her her sons life which his foe a cruel tyrant had presumptuously by wicked doom condemned a wretched death to die to whom god neptune softly smiling thus daughter me seems of double wrong you plain gainst one that hath both wronged you and us for death t'adward i weened did appertain to none but to the seas sole sovereign read therefore who it is which this hath wrought and for what cause the truth discover plain for never wight so evil did or thought but would some rightful cause pretend though rightly nought to whom she answered then it is by name proteus that hath ordained my son to die for that a waist the which by fortune came upon your seas he claimed as property and yet nor his nor his in equity but yours the waift by high prerogative therefore i humbly crave your majesty it to replevy and my son reprieve so shall you by one gift save all us three alive he granted it and straight his warrant made under the seagods seal authentical commanding proteus straight t'enlarge the maid which wandering on his seas imperial he lately took and since kept as thrall which she receiving with meet thankfulness departed straight to proteus therewithal who reading it with inward loathfulness was grieved to restore the pledge he did possess yet durst he not the warrant to withstand but unto her delivered florimell whom she receiving by the lily hand admired her beauty much as she mote well for she all living creatures did excel and was right joyous that she got had so fair a wife for her son marinell so home with her she straight the virgin lad and showed her to him then being soar bestead who soon as he beheld that angels face adorned with all divine perfection his cheered heart eftsoons away gan chase sad death revived with her sweet inspection and feeble spirit inly felt refection as withered weed through cruel winter's tine that feels the warmth of sunny beams reflection lifts up his head that did before decline and begins to spread his leaf before the fair sunshine right so himself did marinell uprear when he in place his dearest love did spy and though his limbs could not his body bear ne former strength return so suddenly yet cheerful signs he showed outwardly ne less was she in secret heart affected but that she masked it with modesty for fear she should of lightness be detected which to another place i leave to be perfected the fifth booke of the faerie qveene containing the legend of artegall or of ivstice so oft as i with state of present time the image of the antique world compare when as men age was in his freshest prime and the first blossom of fair virtue bore such odds i find betwixt those and these which are as that through long continuance of his course me seems die world is run quite out of square from the first point of his appointed source and being once amiss grows daily worser and worser for from the golden age that first was nam it's now at erst become a stony one and men themselves the which at first were framed of earthly mould and formed of flesh and bone are now transformed into hardest stone such as behind their backs so backward bred were thrown by pyrrha and deucalione and if then those may any worse be read they into that ere long will be degendered let none then blame me if in discipline of virtue and of civil uses lore i do not form them to the common line of present days which are corrupted soar but to the antique use which was of yore when good was only for it self desired and all men sought their own and none no more when justice was not for most meed outhired but simple truth did rain and was of all admired for that which all men then did virtue call is now called vice and that which vice was hight is now hight virtue and so used of all right now is wrong and wrong that was is right as all things else in time are changed quite ne wonder for the heavens revolution is wandered far from where it first was pight and so do make contrary constitution of all this lower world towards his dissolution for who so list into the heavens look and search the courses of the rolling spheres shall find that from the point where they first took their setting forth in these few thousand years they all are wandered much that plain appears for that same golden fleecy ram which boar phrixus and helle from their stepdame's fears hath now forgotten where he was placed of yore and shouldered hath the bull which fair europa boar and eke the bull hath with his bow-bent horn so hardly butted those two twins of ioue that they have crushed the crab and quite him born into the great nemoean lions grove so now all range and do at random rove out of their proper places far away and all this world with them amiss do move and all his creatures from their course astray till they arrive at their last ruinous decay ne is that same great glorious lamp of light that does enlumine all these lesser fires in better case ne keeps his course more right but is miscarried with the other spheres for since the term of fourteene hundred years that learned ptolomaee his hight did take he is declined from that mark of theirs nigh thirtie minutes to the southern lake that makes me fear in time he will us quite forsake and if to those egyptian wizards old which in star-read were wont have best insight faith may be given it is by them told that since the time they first took the suns hight foure times his place he shifted hath in sighed and twice hath risen where he now does west and wested twice where he ought rise aright but mostis mars amiss of all the rest and next to him old saturne that was wont be best for during saturnes ancient reign it's said that all the world with goodness did abound all loved virtue no man was afraid of force ne fraud in wight was to be found no war was known no dreadful trumpets found peace universal reigned amongst men and beasts and all things freely grew out of the ground justice sat high adored with solemn feasts and to all people did divide her dreaded behests most sacred virtue she of all the rest resembling god in his imperial might whose sovereign pour is herein most expressed that both to good and bad he deals right and all his works with justice hath bedight that pour he also does to princes lend and makes then like himself in glorious sighed to fit in his own seat his cause to end and rule his people right as he does recommend dread sovereign goddess that dost highest fit in seat of judgement in th'almighties place and with magnific might and wondrous wit dost to thy people righteous doom aread that furthest nations fills with awful dread pardon the boldness of thy basest thrall that dare discourse of so divine a read as thy great justice praised over all the instrument whereof lo here thy artegall cant. i artegall trained in justice lore irenaes quest pursued he doth avenge on sanglier his ladies blood imbrued though virtue then were held in highest price in those old times of which i do entreat yet then likewise the wicked seed of vice began to spring which shortly grew full great and with their boughs the gentle plants did beatrice but evermore some of the virtuous raze rose up inspired with heroic heat that cropped the branches of the sient base and with strong hand their fruitful rankness did deface such first was bacchus that with furious might all east before untamed did overrun and wrong repressed and established right which lawless men had formerly fordone there justice first her princely rule begun next hercules his like ensample showed who all the west with equal conquest won and monstrous tyrants with his club subdued the club of justice dread with kingly pour endued and such was he of whom i have to tell the champion of true justice artegall whom as you lately mote remember well and hard adventure which did then befall into redoubted peril forth did call that was to succour a distressed dame whom a strong tyrant did unjustly thrall and from the heritage which she did claim did with strong hand withhold grantorto was his name wherefore the lady which eirena hight did to the fairy queen her way address to whom complaining her afflicted plighted she her besought of gracious redress that sovereign queen that mighty empress whose glory is to aid all suppliants poor and of weak princes to be patroness chosen artegall to right her to restore for that to her he seemed best skilled in righteous lore for artegall in justice was upbrought even from the cradle of his infancy and all the depth of rightful doom was taught by fair astraea with great industry whilst here on earth the lived mortally for till the world from his perfection fell into all filth and foul iniquity astraea here amongst earthly men did dwell and in the rules of justice them instructed well while through the world she walked in this sort upon a day she found this gentle child among his peers playing his childish sport whom seeing fit and with no crime defiled she did allure with gifts and speeches mild to weened with her so thence him far she brought into a cave from company exiled in which she nursled him till years he reached and all the discipline of justice there him taught there she him taught to weigh both right and wrong in equal balance with due recompense and equity to measure out along according to the line of conscience when so it needs with rigour to dispense of all the which for want there of mankind she caused him to make experience upon wild beasts which she in woods did find with wrongful pour oppressing others of their kind thus she him trained and thus she him taught in all the skill of deeming wrong and right until the ripeness of men years he reached that even wild beasts did fear his awful sighed and men admired his overruling might ne any lived on ground that durst withstand his dreadful hest much less him match in fight or bide the horror of his wreakful hand when so he list in wrath lift up his steely brand which steely brand to make him dreaded more she gave unto him got by her slight and earnest search where it was kept in store in ioues eternal house unwist of wight since he himself it used in that great fight against the titans that whilom rebelled gainst highest heaven chrysaor it was hight chrysaor that all other swords excelled well proved in that same day when ioue those giants quelled for of most perfect metal it was made tempered with adamant among the same and garnished all with gold upon the blade in goodly wise whereof it took his name and was of no less virtue then of fame for there no substance was so firm and hard but it would pierce or cleave where so it came ne any armour could his dint out ward but wheresoever it did light it thoroughly shared now when the world with sin gan to abound astraea loathing longer here to space amongst wicked men in whom no truth she found returned to heaven whence she derived her raze where she hath now and everlasting place amongst those twelue signs which nightly we do see the heavens bright-shining baldric to enchase and is the virgin sixt in her degree and next her self her righteous balance hanging be but when she parted hence she left her groom and iron man which did on her attend always to execute her steadfast doom and willed him with artegall to weened and do what ever thing he did intend his name was talus made of iron mould immovable resistless without end who in his hand and iron flail did hold with which he threshed out falsehood and did truth unfold he now went with him in this new inquest him for to aid if aid he chanced to need against that cruel tyrant which oppressed the fair irena with his foul misdeed and kept the crown in which she should succeed and now together on their way they been when as they saw a squire in squalid weed lamenting soar his sorrowful sad tyne with many bitter tears shed from his blubbered eyes to whom as they approached they espied a sorry sighed as ever seen with eye and headless lady lying him beside in her own blood all wallowed woefully that her gay clothes did in discolour die much was he moved at that rueful sighed and flamed with zeal of vengeance inwardly he asked who had that dame so foully dight or whither his own hand or whither other wight ah woe is me and well away quoth he bursting forth tears like springs out of a bank that ever i this dismal day did see full far was i from thinking such a prank yet little loss it were and much thank if i should grant that i have done the same that i mote drink the cup whereof she drank but that i should die guilty of the blame the which another did who now is fled with shame who was it then said artegall that wrought and why do it declare unto me true a knight said he if knight he may be thought that did his hand in ladies blood embrew and for no cause but as i shall you show this day as i in solace sat hereby with a fair love whose loss i now do rew there came this knight having in company this luckless lady which now here does headless lie he whither mine seemed fairer in his eye or that he waxed weary of his own would change with me but i did it deny so did the ladies both as may be known but he whose spirit was with pride upblown would not so rest contented with his right but having from his courser her down thrown from me rest mine away by lawless might and on his steed her set to bear her out of sighed which when his lady saw she followed fast and on him catching hold gan loud to cry not so to leave her nor away to cast but rather of his hand besought to die with that his sword he drew all wrathfully and at one stroke cropped off her head with scorn in that same place whereas it now does lie so he my love away with him hath born and left me here both his & mine own love to morn aread said he which way then did he make and by what marks may he be known again to hope quoth he him soon to overtake that hence so long departed is but vain but yet he pricked over yonder plain and as i marked boar upon his shield by which it's easy him to know again a broken sword within a bloody field expressing well his nature which the same did wield no sooner said but straight he after sent his iron page who him pursued so light as that it seemed above the ground he went for he was swift as swallow in her flight and strong as eyon in his lordly might it was not long before he overtook sir sanglier so cleped was that knight whom at the first he guessed by his look and by the other marks which of his shield he took he bade him stay and back with him retire who full of scorn to be commanded so the lady to alight did est require whilst he reformed that uncivil so and straight at him with all his force did go who moved no more therewith then when a rock is lightly stricken with some stones throw but to him leaping lent him such a knock that on the ground he laid him like a senseless block but ere he could him self recure again him in his iron paw he seized had that when he waked out of his wareless pain he found him self unwist so ill bestead that limb he could not wag thence he him lad bound like a beast appointed to the stall the sighed whereof the lady soar dreaded and feigned to fly for fear of being thrall but he her quickly stayed and forced to weened withal when to the place they came where artegall by that same careful squire did then abide he gently gan him to demand of all that did betwixt him and that squire betide who with stern countenance and indignant pride did answer that of all he guiltless stood and his accuser thereupon defied for neither he did shed that ladies blood nor took away his love but his own proper good well did the squire perceive him self too weak to answer his defiance in the field and rather chosen his challenge off to break then to approve his right with spear and shield and rather guilty chosen him self to yield but artegall by signs perceiving plain that he it was not which that lady killed but that strange knight the fairer love to gain did cast about by sleight the truth thereout to strain and said now sure this doubtful causes right can hardly but by sacrament be tried or else by ordeal or by bloody fight that ill perhaps mote fallen to either side but if you please that i your cause decide perhaps i may all further quarrel end so you will swear my judgement to abide thereto they both did frankly condescend and to his doom with listful ears did both attend sith then said he you both the dead deny and both the living lady claim your right let both the dead and living equally divided be betwixt you here in sighed and each of either take his share aright but look who does dissent from this my read he for a twelue months day shall in despite bear for his penance that same ladies head to witness to the world that she by him is dead well pleased with that doom was sangliere and offered straight the lady to be slain but that same squire to whom she was more dear when as he saw she should be cut in twaine did yield she rather should with him remain alive then to him self be shared dead and rather then his love should suffer pain he chosen with shame to bear that ladies head true love despises shame when life is called in dread whom when so willing artegall perceived not so thou squire he said but thine i deem the living lady which from thee he reaved for worthy thou of her dost rightly seem and you sir knight that love so light esteem as that you would for little leave the same take here your own that does you best beseem and with it bear the burden of defame your own dead ladies head to tell abroad your shame but sangliere disdained much his doom and sternly gan repine at his behest ne would for ought obey as did become to bear that ladies head before his breast until that talus had his pride repressed and forced him maugre it up to rear who when he saw it bootless to resist he took it up and thence with him did bear as rated spaniel takes his burden up for fear much did that squire sir artegall adore for his great justice held in high regard and as his squire him offered evermore to serve for want of other meet reward and weened with him on his adueuture hard but he thereto would by no means consent but leaving him forth on his journey fared ne wight with him but only talus went they two enough encounter and whole regiment cant. ii artegall hears of florimell does with the pagan fight him slays drowns lady momera does raze her castle quite nought is more honourable to a knight ne better does beseem brave chivalry then to defend the feeble in their right and wrong redress in such as weened awry whilom those great heroes god thereby their greatest glory for their rightful deeds and place deserved with the gods on high herein the noblesse of this knight exceeds who now to perils great for justice sake proceeds to which as he now was upon the way he chanced to meet a dwarf in hasty course whom he required his forward haste to stay till he of tidings mote with him discourse loath was the dwarf yet did he stay perforce and gan of sundry news his store to tell and to his memory they had recourse but chiefly of the fairest florimell how she was found again and spoused to marinell for this was dony florimels own dwarf whom having lost as you have herd whilere and finding in the way the scattered scarf the fortune of her life long time did fear but of her health when artegall did hear and safe return he was full inly glad and asked him where and when her bridal cheer should be solemnized for if time he had he would be there and honour to her spousal and within three days quoth she as i do here it will be at the castle of the strand what time if nought me let i will be there to do her service so as i am bound but in my way a little here beyond a cursed cruel sarazin does won that keeps a bridges passage by strong hound and many errant knights hath there fordone that makes all men for fear that passage for to shun what mister wight quoth he and how far hence is he that does to travellers such harms he is said he a man of great defence expert in battle and in deeds of arms and more emboldened by the wicked charms with which his daughter does him still support having great lordship's god and goodly farms through strong oppression of his pour extort by which he still them holds & keeps with strong effort and daily he his wrongs increases more for never wight he lets to pass that way over his bridge albe he rich or poor but he him makes his passage-penny pay else he does hold him back or beatrice away thereto he hath a groom of evil guise whose scalp is bore that bondage does bewray which polls and pills the poor in piteous wise but he him self upon the rich does tyrannise his name is hight pollente rightly so for that he is so puissant and strong that with his pour he all does overgo and makes them subject to his mighty wrong and some by sleight he eke does underfang for on a bridge he customs to fight which is but narrow but exceeding long and in the same are many trap falls pight through which the rider down does fallen through oversight and underneath the same a river flows that is both swift and dangerous deep withal into the which whom so he overthrows all destitute of help does headlong fallen but he him self through practice usual leaps forth into the flood and there assays his foe confused through his sudden fallen that horse and man he equally dismays and either both them drowns or traitorously slays then does he take the spoil of them at will and to his daughter brings that dwells thereby who all that comes does take and therewith fill the coffers of her wicked treasury which she with wrongs hath heaped up so high that many princes she in wealth exceeds and purchased all the country lying nigh with the revenue of her plenteous meeds her name is munera agreeing with her deeds thereto she is full fair and rich attired with golden hands and silver feet beside that many lords have her to wife desired but she them all despises for great pride now by my life said he and god to guide none other way will i this day betake but by that bridge whereas he does abide therefore me thither led no more he spoke but thitherward forthright his ready way did make unto the place he came within a while where on the bridge he ready armed saw the sarazin awaiting for some spoil who as they to the passage gan to draw a villain to them came with scull all raw that passage money did of them require according to the custom of their law to whom he answered wroth lo there thy hire and with that word him struck that straight he did expire which when the pagan saw he waxed wroth and straight him self unto the fight addressed ne was sir artegall behind so both together ran with ready spears in rest right in the midst whereas they breast to breast should meet a trap was let down to fallen into the flood straight leapt the carl unblest well weening that his foe was fallen withal but he was well aware and leapt before his fallen there being both together in the flood they each at other tyrannousty flew ne ought the water cooled their hot blood but rather in them kindled choler new but there the paynim who that use well knew to fight in water great advantage had that oftentimes him nigh he overthrew and eke the courser whereupon he read could swim like to a fish while he his back bestrode which odds when as sir artegall espied he saw no way but close with him in haste and to him driving strongly down the tide upon his iron collar gripped fast that with the strain his weasand nigh he braced there they together strove and struggled long either the other from his steed to cast ne ever artegall his gripple strong for any thing would slack but still upon him hung as when a dolphin and a sele are met in the wide champion of the ocean plain with cruel chause their courages they whet the masterdom of each by force to gain and dreadful battle betwixt them do deraign they snuff they snort they bounce they rage they roar that all the sea disturbed with their train does fry with some above the surges hoar such was betwixt these two the troublesome uproar so artegall at length him forced forsake his horses back for dread of being drowned and to his handy swimming him betake eftsoones him self he from his hold unbound and then no ods at all in him he found for artegall in swimming skilful was and durst the depth of any water sound so ought each knight that use of peril has in swimming be expert through waters force to pass then very doubtful was the wars event uncertain whither had the better side for both were skildin that experiment and both in arms well trained and thoroughly tried but art equal was better breathed beside and towards th'end grew greater in his might that his faint foe no longer could abide his puissance ne bear him self upright but from the water to the land betook his flight but artegall pursued him still so near with bright chrysaor in his cruel hand that as his head he gan a little rear above the brink to tread upon the land he smote it off that tumbling on the strand it bit the earth for very fell despite and gnashed with his teeth as if he band high god whose goodness he despaired quite or cursed the hand which did that vengeance on him dight his corpse was carried down along the lee whose waters with his filthy blood it stained but his blasphemous head that all might see he pitched upon a pole on high ordained where many years it afterwards remained to be a mirror to all mighty men in whose right hands great power is contained that none of them the feeble overrun but always do their pour within just compass pen that done unto the castle he did weened in which the painims daughter did abide guarded of many which did her defend of whom he entrance sought but was denied and with reproachful blasphemy defied beaten with stones down from the battlement that he was forced to withdraw aside and bade his servant talus to invent which way he enter might without endangerment eftsoones his page drew to the castle gate and with his iron flail at it let fly that all the warders it did soar amate the which erewhile spoke so reproachfully and made them stoop that looked erst so high yet still he bet and bounced upon the door and thundered strokes thereon so hideously that all the piece he shaked from the flore and filled all the house with fear and great uproar with noise whereof the lady forth appeared upon the castle wall and when she saw the dangerous state in which she stood she feared the sad effect of her near overthrow and gan entreat that iron man below to cease his outrage and him fair besought sith neither force of stones which they did throw nor power of charms which she against him wrought might otherwise prevail or make him cease for ought but when as yet she saw him to proceed unmoved with prayers or with piteous thought she meant him to corrupt with goodly meed and caused great sacks with endless riches fraught unto the battlement to be upbrought and poured forth over the castle wall that she might win some time though dearly bought whilst he to gathering of the gold did fallen but he was nothing moved nor tempted therewithal but still continued his assault the more and laid on load with his huge iron flail that at the length he has rent the door and made way for his master to assail who being entered nought did then avail for wight against his pour them selves to rear each one did fly their hearts began to fail and hid them selves in corners here and there and eke their dame half dead did hide her self for fear long they her sought yet no where could they find her that sure they weened she was escaped away but talus that could like a limehound wind her and all things secret wisely could bewray at length found out whereas she hidden lay under and heap of gold thence he her drew by the fair locks and foully did array withouten pity of her goodly hew that artegall him self her seemless plighted did rew yet for no pity would he change the course of justice which in talus hand did lie who rudely hailed her forth without remorse still holding up her suppliant hands on high and kneeling at his feet submissively but he her suppliant hands those hands of gold and eke her feet those feet of silver try which sought unrighteousness and justice sold chopped off and nailed on high that all might them behold her self then took he by the slender waste in vain loud crying and into the flood over the castle wall adown her cast and there her drowned in the dirty mud but the stream washed away her guilty blood thereafter all that mucky pelf he took the spoil of peoples evil got good the which her sire had scraped by hook and crook and burning all to ashes poured it down the brook and lastly all that castle quite he razed even from the sole of his foundation and all the hewn stones thereof defaced that there mote be no hope of reparation nor memory thereof to any nation all which when talus thoroughly had performed sir artegall undid the evil fashion and wicked customs of that bridge reformed which done unto his former journey he returned in which they measured much weary way till that at length nigh to the sea they drew by which as they did travel on a day they saw before them far as they could view full many people gathered in a crew whose great assembly they did much admire for never there the like resort they knew so towards them they coasted to inquire what thing so many nations met did there desire there they beheld a mighty giant stand upon a rock and holding forth on high and huge great pair of balance in his hand with which he boasted in his surquedry that all the world he would weigh equally if ought he had the same to counterpoise for want whereof he weighed vanity and filled his balance full of idle toys yet was admired much of fools women and boys he said that he would all the earth uptake and all the sea divided each from either so would he of the fire one balance make and one of the without or wind or weather then would he balance heaven and hell together and all that did within them all contain of all whose weight he would not miss a feather and look what surplus did of each remain he would to his own part restore the same again for why he said they all unequal were and had encroached upon others share like as the sea which plain he showed there had worn the care so did the fire the air so all the rest did others parts impair and so were realms and nations run awry all which he undertook for to repair in sort as they were formed anciently and all things would reduce unto equality therefore the vulgar did about him flock and cluster thick unto his leasings vain like foolish flies about and honey crock in hope by him great benefit to gain and uncontrolled freedom to obtain all which when artegall did see and hear how he misled the simple peoples train in sdainful wise he drew unto him near and thus unto him spoke without regard or fear thou that presumest to weigh the world anew and all things to and equal to restore in stead of right me seems great wrong dost show and far above thy forces pitch to soar for ere thou limit what is less or more in every thing thou oughtest first to know what was the poise of every part of yore and look then how much it does overflow or fail thereof so much is more then just to trow for at the first they all created were in goodly measure by their makers might and weighed out in balances so never that not a dram was missing of their right the earth was in the middle centre pight in which it does immovable abide hemmed in with waters like a wall in sighed and they with air that not a drop can slide all which the heavens contain & in their courses guide such heavenly justice does among them rain that every one do know their certain bound in which they do these many years remain and amongst them all no change hath yet been found but if thou now shouldst weigh them new in pound we are not sure they would so long remain all change is perilous and all chance unsound therefore leave off to weigh them all again till we may be assured they shall their course retain thou foolish elf said then the giant wroth seest not how badly all things present bee and each estate quite out of order goes the sea it self dost thou not plainly see encroach upon the land there under thee and earth it self how daily its increased by all that dying to it turned be were it not good that wrong were then surceased and from the most that some were given to the least therefore i will throw down these mountains high and make them level with the lowly plain these towering rocks which reach unto the sky i will thrust down into the deepest main and as they were them equalise again tyrants that make men subject to their law i will suppress that they no more may rain and lordings curb that commons overawe and all the wealth of rich men to the poor will draw of things unseen how canst thou deem aright then answered the righteous artegall sith thou misdeemest so much of things in sighed what though the sea with waves continual do eat the earth it is no more at all ne is the earth the less or loses ought for whatsoever from one place does fallen is with the tide unto and other brought for there is nothing lost that may be found if sought likewise the earth is not augmented more by all that dying into it do fade for of the earth they formed were of yore how ever gay their blossom or their blade do flourish now they into dust shall vade what wrong then is it if that when they die they turn to that whereof they first were made all in the pour of their great maker lie all creatures must obey the voice of the most high they live they die like as he does ordain ne ever any asks reason why the hills do not the lowly dales disdain the dales do not the lofty hills envy he makes kings to fit in sovereignty he makes subjects to their pour obey he pulls down he sets up on high he gives to this from that he takes away for all we have is his what he list do he may what ever thing is done by him is done ne any may his mighty will withstand ne any may his sovereign power shun ne lose that he hath bound with steadfast band in vain therefore dost thou now take in hand to call to count or weigh his works anew whose counsels depth thou canst not understand sith of things subject to thy daily view thou dost not know the causes nor their courses due for take thy balance if thou be so wise and weigh the wind that under heaven does blow or weigh the light that in the east does rise or weigh the thought that from men mind does flow but if the weight of these thou canst not show weigh but one word which from thy lips does fallen for how canst thou those greater secrets know that dost not know the least thing of them all ill can he rule the great that cannot reach the small therewith the giant much abashed said that he of little things made reckoning light yet the least word that ever could be laid within his balance he could way aright which is said he more heavy then in weight the right or wrong the false or else the true he answered that he would try it straight so he the words into his balance threw but straight the winged words out of his balance flew wroth waxed he then and said that words were light ne would within his balance well abide but he could justly weigh the wrong or right well then said artegall let it be tried first in one balance set the true aside he did so first and then the false he laid in th'other scale but still it down did slide and by no mean could in the weight be stayed for by no means the false will with the truth be weighed now take the right likewise said artegale and counterpoise the same with so much wrong so first the right he put into one scale and then the giant strove with puissance strong to fill the other scale with so much wrong but all the wrongs that he therein could lay might not it peise yet did he labour long and sweated and chafed and proved every way yet all the wrongs could not a little right down way which when he saw he greatly grew in rage and almost would his balances have broken but artegall him fairly gan assuage and said be not upon thy balance wrought for they do nought but right or wrong betoken but in the mind the doom of right must be and so likewise of words the which be spoken the ear must be the balance to decree and judge whither with truth or falsehood they agree but set the truth and set the right aside for they with wrong or falsehood will not fare and put two wrongs together to be tried or else two falses of each equal share and then together do them both compare for truth is one and right is ever one so did he and then plain it did appear whither of them the greater were atone but right sat in the midst of the beam alone but he the right from thence did thrust away for it was not the right which he did seek but rather strove extremities to way th'one to diminish th'other for to eke for of the mean he greatly did misleek whom when so lewdly minded talus found approaching nigh unto him cheek by cheek he shouldered him from off the higher ground and down the rock him throwing in the sea him drowned like as a ship whom cruel tempest drives upon a rock with horrible dismay her shattered ribs in thousand pieces rives and spoiling all her gears and goodly ray does makes her self misfortunes piteous prey so down the cliff the wretched giant tumbled his battered balances in pieces lay his timbered bones all broken rudely rumbled so was the high aspiring with huge ruin humbled that when the people which had there about long waited saw his sudden desolation they gan to gather in tumultuous rout and mutining to stir up civil faction for certain loss of so great expectation for well they hoped to have god great good and wondrous riches by his innovation therefore resolving to revenge his blood they rose in arms and all in battle order stood which lawless multitude him coming too in warlike wise when artegall did view he much was troubled ne wist what to do for loath he was his noble hands t'embrew in the base blood of such a rascal crew and otherwise if that he should retire he feared least they with shame would him pursue therefore he talus to them sent t'inquire the cause of their array and truce for to desire but soon as they him nigh approaching spied they gan with all their weapons him assay and rudely stroke at him on every side yet nought they could him hurt ne ought dismay but when at them he with his flail gan lay he like a swarm of flies them overthrew ne any of them durst come in his way but here and there before his presence flew and hid themselves in holes and bushes from his view as when a falcon hath with nimble flight flown at a flush of ducks foreby the brook the trembling foul dismayed with dreadful sighed of death the which them almost overtook do hide themselves from her astonying look among the flags and covert round about when talus saw they all the field forsook and none appeared of all that rascal rout to artegall he turned and went with him throughout cant. iii the spousals of fair florimell where turney many knights there braggadochio is uncased in all the ladies sights after long storms and tempests overblown the sun at length his joyous face does clear so when as fortune all her spite hath shown some blissful hours at last must needs appear else should afflicted wights oftimes despair so comes

for so much as to my lot here lights that with this present treatise does agree true virtue to advance shall here recounted be when all men had with full satiety of meats and drinks their appetites sufficed to deeds of arms and proof of chivalry they gan themselves address full rich aguised as each one had his furnitures devise and first of all issued sir marinell and with him sixe knights more which enterprised to challenge all in right of florimell and to maintain that she all others did excel the first of them was hight sir orimont a noble knight and tried in hard assays the second had to name sir bellisont but second unto none in prowess praise the third was brunell famous in his days the fourth ecastor of exceeding might the fift armeddan skilled in lovely lays the sixt was lansack a redoubted knight all sixe well seen in arms and proved in many a fight and them against came all that list to joust from every coast and country under sun none was debarred but all had leave that lust the trumpets found then all together run full many deeds of arms that day were done and many knights unhorsed and many wounded as fortune fell yet little lost or won but all that day the greatest praise redounded to marinell whose name the heralds loud resounded the second day so soon as morrow light appeared in heaven into the field they came and there all day continued cruel fight with diverse fortune fit for such a game in which all strove with peril to win fame yet whither side was victor note be guessed but at the last the trumpets did proclaim that marinell that day deserved best so they disparted were and all men went to rest the third day came that should due trial lend of all the rest and then this warlike crew together met of all to make and end there marinell great deeds of arms did show and through the thickest like a lion flew rashing oft helms and riving plataeae a sunder that every one his danger did eschew so terribly his dreadful strokes did thunder that all men stood amazed & at his might did wonder but what on earth can always happy stand the greater prowess greater perils find so far he passed among his enemies band that they have him enclosed so behind as by no means he can himself outwind and now perforce they have him prisoner taken and now they do with captive bans him bind and now they led him thence of all forsaken unless some succour had in time him overtaken it fortuned whilst they were thus ill beset sir artegall into the tiltyard came with braggadochio whom he lately met upon the way with that his snowy dame where when he understood by common fame what evil hap to marinell betid he much was moved at so unworthy shame and straight that boaster prayed with whom he rid to change his shield with him to be the better hid so forth he went and soon them over hent where they were leading marinell away whom he assailed with dreadless hardiment and forced the burden of their prize to stay they were and hundred knights of that array of which th'one half upon himself did set th'other stayed behind to guard the prey but he ere long the former fiftie bet and from th'other fiftie soon the prisoner fetched so back he brought sir marinell again whom having quickly armed again anew they both together joined might and main to set afresh on all the other crew whom with soar havoc soon they overthrew and chased quite out of the field that none against them durst his head to peril show so were they left lords of the field alone so marinell by him was rescued from his foes which when he had performed then back again to braggadochio did his shield restore who all this while behind him did remain keeping there close with him in precious store that his false lady as you herd afore then did the trumpets found and judges rose and all these knights which that day armour boar came to the open hall to listen whose the honour of the prize should be adjudged by those and thither also came in open sighed fair florimell into the common hall to greet his guerdon unto every knight and best to him to whom the best should fallen then for that stranger knight they loud did call to whom that day they should the garland yield who came not forth but for sir artegall came braggadochio and did show his shield which boar the sun broad blazed in a golden field the sighed whereof did all with gladness fill so unto him they did addeem the prize of all that triumph then the trumpets shrill done braggadochios name resounded thrice so courage lent a cloak to cowardice and then to him came fairest florimell and goodly gan to greet his brave emprise and thousand thanks him yield that had so well approved that day that she all others did excel to whom the boaster that all knights did blot with proud disdain did scornful answer make that what he did that day he did it not for her but for his own deer ladies sake whom on his peril he did undertake both her and eke all others to excel and further did uncomely speeches crake much did his words the gentle lady quell and turned aside for shame to hear what he did tell then forth he brought his snowy florimele whom trompart had in keeping there beside covered from peoples gazement with a veil whom when discovered they had thoroughly eyed with great amazement they were stupefied and said that surely florimell it was or if it were not florimell so tried that florimell her self she then did pass so feeble skill of perfect things the vulgar has which when as marinell beheld likewise he was therewith exceedingly dismayed ne wist he what to think or to devise but like as one whom fiends had made afraid he long astonished stood ne ought he said ne ought he did but with fast fixed eyes he gazed still upon that snowy maid whom ever as he did the more avise the more to be true florimell he did surmise as when two suns appear in the azure sky mounted in phoebus chariot fiery bright both darting forth fair beams to each men eye and both adorned with lamps of flaming light all that behold so strange prodigious sighed not knowing nature's work nor what to ween are rapt with wonder and with rare affright so stood sir marinell when he had seen the semblant of this false by his fair beauty's queen all which when artegall who all this while stood in the press close covered well adviewed and saw that boaster's pride and graceless guile he could no longer bear but forth issued and unto all himself there open showed and to the boaster said thou losel base that hast with borrowed plumes thy self endued and others worth with leasings dost deface when they are all restored thou shalt rest in disgrace that shield which thou dost bear was it indeed which this days honour saved to marinell but not that arm nor thou the man i reed which didst that service unto florimell for proof show forth thy sword and let it tell what strokes what dreadful stour it stirred this day or show the wounds which unto thee befell or show the sweat with which thou didst sway so sharp a battle that so many did dismay but this the sword which wrought those cruel stounds and this the arm the which that shield did bear and these the signs so showed forth his wounds by which that glory got does appear as for this lady which he shows here is not i wager florimell at all but some fair franion fit for such a fere that by misfortune in his hand did fallen for proof whereof he bade them florimell forth call so forth the noble lady was brought adorned with honour and all comely grace whereto her bashful shamefastness wrought a great increase in her fair blushing face as roses did with lilies interlace for of those words the which that boaster threw she inly yet conceived great disgrace whom when as all the people such did view they shouted loud and signs of gladness all did show then did he set her by that snowy one like the true saint beside the image set of both their beauty's to make paragon and trial whither should the honour get straight way so soon as both together met enchanted damosel vanished into nought her snowy substance melted as with heat ne of that goodly hew remained ought but empty girdle which about her waste was wrought as when the daughter of thaumantes fair hath in a watery cloud displayed wide her goodly bow which paints the liquid air that all men wonder at her colours pride all suddenly ere one can look aside the glorious picture vanishes away ne any token does thereof abide so did this ladies goodly form decay and into nothing go ere one could it bewray which when as all that present were beheld they stricken were with great astonishment and their faint hearts with senseless horror quelled to see the thing that seemed so excellent so stolen from their fancies wonderment that what of it became none understood and braggadochio self with dreariment so daunted was in his despairing mood that like a lifeless corpse immovable he stood but artegall that golden belt uptook the which of all her spoil was only left which was not hers as many it mistook but florimells own girdle from her reft while she was flying like a weary wove from that foul monster which did her compel to perils great which he unbuckling eft presented to the fairest florimell who round about her tender waste it fitted well full many ladies often had assayed about their middles that fair belt to knit and many a one supposed to be a maid yet it to none of all their loins would fit till florimell about her fastened it such power it had that to no woman's waste by any skill or labour it would fit unless that she were continent and chaste but it would loose or break that many had disgraced whilst thus they busied were bout florimell and boastful braggadochio to defame sir guyon as by fortune then befell forth from the thickest press of people came his own good steed which he had stolen to claim and th'one hand seizing on his golden bit with th'other drew his sword for with the same he meant the thief there deadly to have smit and had he not be held he nought had failed of it thereof great hurly burly moved was throughout the hall for that same warlike horse for braggadochio would not let him pass and guyon would him algates have perforce or it approve upon his carrion corpse which troublous stir when artegall perceived he nigh them drew to stay avengers force and gan inquire how was that steed bereaved whither by might extort or else by slight deceived who all that piteous story which befell about that woeful couple which were slain and their young bloody babe to him gan tell with whom while he did in the wood remain his horse purloined was by subtle train for which he challenged the thief to fight but he for nought could him thereto constrain for as the death he hated such despite and rather had to loose then try in arms his right which artegall well hearing though no more by law of arms there need ones right to try as was the wont of warlike knights of yore then that his foe should him the field deny yet further right by tokens to descry he asked what privy tokens he did bear if that said guyon may you satisfy within his mouth a black spot does appear shaped like a horses shoe who list to seek it there whereof to make due trial one did take the horse in hand within his mouth to look but with his heals so sorely he him strake that all his ribs he quite in pieces broke that never word from that day forth he spoke another that would seem to have more wit him by the bright embroidered headstall took but by the shoulder him so soar he bit that he him maimed quite and all his shoulder split ne he his mouth would open unto wight until that guyon self unto him spoke and called brigadore so was he hight whose voice so soon as he did undertake eftsoons he stood as still as any stake and suffered all his secret mark to see and when as he him named for joy he brake his bans and followed him with gladful glee and frisked and flung aloft and louted low on knee thereby sir artegall did plain aread that unto him the horse belonged and said lo there sir guyon take to you the steed as he with golden saddle is arrayed and let that losel plainly now displayed hence fare on foot till he and horse have gained but the proud boaster gan his doom upbraid and him reviled and rated and disdained that judgement so unjust against him had ordained much was the knight incensed with his lewd word to have revenged that his villainy and thrice did lay his hand upon his sword to have him slain or dearly done aby but guyon did his choler pacify saying sir knight it would dishonour be to you that are our judge of equity to wreak your wrath on such a carl as he it's punishment enough that all his shame do see so did he mitigate sir artegall but talus by the back the boaster hent and drawing him out of the open hall upon him did inflict this punishment first he his beard did shave and foully shent then from him reft his shield and it reversed and blotted out his arms with falsehood blended and himself baffled and his arms unhearsed and broke his sword in twaine and all his armour dispersed the while his guileful groom was fled away but vain it was to think from him to fly who overtaking him did disarray and all his face deformed with infamy and out of court him scourged openly so ought all faitors that true knighthood shame and arms dishonour with base villainy from all brave knights be banished with defame for oft their lewdness blots good deserts with blame now when these counterfeits were thus uncased out of the foreside of their forgery and in the sighed of all men clean disgraced all gan to jest and gibe full merrily at the remembrance of their knavery ladies can laugh at ladies knights at knights to think with how great vaunt of bravery he them abused through his subtle slights and what a glorious show he made in all their sights there leave we them in pleasure and repast spending their joyous days and gladful nights and taking usury of time forepast with all deer delices and rare delights fit for such ladies and such lovely knights and turn were here to this fair furrows end our weary yokes to gather fresher sprights that when as time to artegall shall tend we on his first adventure may him forward send cant. iiii artegall deals right betwixt two brothers that do strive saves terpine from the gallow tree and does from death reprine who so upon him self will take the skill true justice unto people to divide had need have mighty hands for to fulfil that which he does with righteous doom decide and for to master wrong and puissant pride for vain it is to deem of things aright and makes wrong doers justice to deride unless it be performed with dreadless might for pour is the right hand of justice truly hight therefore whilom to knights of great emprise the charge of justice given was in trust that they might execute her judgements wise and with their might beatrice down licentious lust which proudly did impugn her sentence just whereof no braver president this day remains on earth preserved from iron rust of rude oblivion and long times decay then this of artegall which here we have to say who having lately left that lovely pair enlinked fast in wedlock's loyal bound bold marinell with florimell the fair with whom great feast and goodly glee he found departed from the castle of the strand to follow his adventures first intent which long ago he taken had in hound ne wight with him for his assistance went but that great iron groom his guard and government with whom as he did pass by the sea shore he chanced to come whereas two comely squires both brothers whom one womb together boar but stirred up with different desires together strove and kindled wrathful fires and them beside two seemly damsels stood by all means seeking to assuage their ires now with fair words but words did little good now with sharp threats but threats the more increased their mood and there before them stood a coffer strong fast bound on every side with iron bans but seeming to have suffered much wrong either by being wrecked upon the sands or being carried far from foreign lands seemed that for it these squires at ods did fallen and bent against them selves their cruel hands but evermore those damsels did forestall their furious encounter and their fierceness pall but firmly fixed they were with dint of sword and battles doubtful proof their rights to try ne other end their fury would afford but what to them fortune would justify so stood they both in readiness thereby to join the combat with cruel intent when artegall arriving happily did stay a while their greedy bickerment till he had questioned the cause of their dissent to whom the elder did this answer frame then weet you sir that we two brothers be to whom oursire milesio by name did equally bequeathe his lands in fee two lands which you there before you see not far in sea of which the one appears but like a little mount of small degree yet was as great and wide ere many years as that same other isle that greater breadth now bears but tract of time that all things does decay and this devouring sea that nought does spare the most part of my land hath washed away and thrown it up unto my brother's share so his increased but mine did impair before which time i loved as was my lot that further maid hight philtera the fair with whom a goodly dour i should have god and should have joined be to her in wedlock's knot then did my younger brother amidas love that same other damosel lucy bright to whom but little dowry allotted was her virtue was the dowry that did delight what better dowry can to a dame be hight but now when philtra saw my lands decay and former livelihood fail she left me quite and to my brother did elope straight way who taking her from me his own love left astray she seeing then her self forsaken so through dolorous despair which she conceived into the sea her self did headlong throw thinking to have her grief by death bereaved but see how much her purpose was deccaued whilst thus amid the billows beating of her betwixt life and death long to and from she weaved she chanced unwares to light upon this coffer which to her in that danger hope of life did offer the wretched maid that erst desired to die when as the pain of death she tasted had and but half seen his ugly visnomy gan to repent that she had been so mad for any death to change life though most bad and catching hold of this sea-beaten chest the lucky pilot of her passage sad after long tossing in the seas distressed her weary bark at last upon mine isle did rest where i by chance then wandering on the shore did her espy and through my good endeavour from dreadful mouth of death which threatened soar her to have swallowed up did help to save her she then in recompense of that great favour which i on her bestowed bestowed on me the portion of that good which fortune gave her together with her self in dowry free both goodly portions but of both the better she yet in this coffer which she with her brought great treasure since we did find contained which as our own we took and so it thought but this same other damosel since hath feigned that to her self that treasure appertained and that she did transport the same by sea to bring it to her husband new ordained but suffered cruel shipwreck by the way but whither it be so or no i can not say but whither it indeed be so or no this do i say that what so good or ill or god or fortune unto me did throw not wronging any other by my will i hold mine own and so will hold it still and though my land he first did win away and then my love though now it little skill yet my good luck he shall not likewise pray but i will it defend while ever that i may so having said the younger did ensue full true it is what so about our land my brother here declared hath to you but not for it this ods betwixt us does stand but for this treasure thrown upon his strand which well i prove as shall appear by trial to be this maids with whom i fastened hand known by good marks and perfect good espial therefore it ought be rendered her without denial when they thus ended had the knight began certes your strife were easy to accord would you remit it to some righteous man unto your self said they we give our word to bide what judgement you shall us afford then for assurance to my doom to stand under my foot let each lay down his sword and then you shall my sentence understand so each of them laid down his sword out of his hand then artegall thus to the younger said now tell me amidas if that you may your brother's land the which the sea hath laid unto your part and plucked from his away by what good right do you withhold this day what other right quoth he should you esteem but that the sea it to my share did lay your right is good said he and so i deem that what the sea unto you sent your own should seem then turning to the elder thus he said now bracidas let this likewise be shown your brother's treasure which from him is strayed being the dowry of his wife well known by what right do you claim to beyour own what other right quoth he should you esteem but that the sea hath it unto me thrown your right is good said he and so i deem that what the sea unto you sent your own should seem for equal right in equal things does stand for what the mighty sea hath once possessed and plucked quite from all possessors' hand whither by rage of waves that never rest or else by wrack that wretches hath distressed he may dispose by his imperial might as thing at random left to whom he list so amidas the land was yours first hight and so the treasure yours is bracidas by right when he his sentence thus pronounced had both amidas and philtra were displeased but bracidas and lucy were right glad and on the treasure by that judgement seized so was their discord by this doom appeased and each one had his right then artegall when as their sharp contention he had ceased departed on his way as did befall to follow his old quest the which him forth did call so as he traveled upon the way he chanced to come where happily he spied a rout of many people far away to whom his course he hastily applied to weet the cause of their assemblance wide to whom when he approached near in sighed and uncouth sighed he plainly then descried to be a troop of women warlike dight with weapons in their hands as ready for to fight and in the midst of them he saw a knight with both his hands behind him pinnowed hard and round about his neck and halter tied as ready for the gallow tree prepared his face was covered and his head was bared that who he was uneath was to descry and with full heavy heart with them he fared grieved to the soul and groaning inwardly that he of women's hands so base a death should die but they like tyrants merciless the more rejoiced at his miserable case and him reviled and reproached soar with bitter taunts and terms of vile disgrace now when as artegall arrived in place did ask what cause brought that man to decay they round about him gan to swarm apace meaning on him their cruel hands to lay and to have wrought unwares some villainous assay but he was soon aware of their ill mind and drawing back deceived their intent yet though him self did shame on womankind his mighty hand to shend he talus sent to wreck on them their follies hardiment who with few souses of his iron flail dispersed all their troop incontinent and sent them home to tell a piteous tale of their vain prowess turned to their proper bale but that same wretched man ordained to die they left behind them glad to be so quit him talus took out of perplexity and horror of fowl death for knight unfit who more then loss of life dreaded it and him restoring unto living light so brought unto his lord where he did fit beholding all that womanish weak fight whom soon as he beheld he knew and thus behight sir turpine hapless man what make you here or have you lost your self and your discretion that ever in this wretched case you were or have you yielded you to proud oppression of women's pour that boast of men's subjection or else what other deadly dismal day is fallen on you by heavens hard direction that you were run so fondly far astray as for to led your self unto your own decay much was the man confounded in his mind partly with shame and partly with dismay that all astonished he him self did find and little had for his excuse to say but only thus most hapless well you may me justly term that to this shame am brought and made the scorn of knighthood this same day but who can escape what his own fate hath wrought the work of heavens will surpasses human thought right true but faulty men use oftentimes to attribute their folly unto fate and lay on heaven the guilt of their own crimes but tell sir terpin ne let you amate your misery how fell you in this state then sith you needs quoth he will know my shame and all the ill which chanced to me of late i shortly will to you rehearse the same in hope you will not turn misfortune to my blame being desirous as all knights are wont through hard adventures deeds of arms to try and after fame and honour for to hunt i herd report that far abroad did fly that a proud amazon did late defy all the brave knights that hold of maidenhead and unto them wrought all the villainy that she could forge in her malicious head which some hath put to shame and many done be dead the cause they say of this her cruel hate is for the sake of bellodant the bold to whom she boar most fervent love of late and wooed him by all the ways she could but when she saw at last that he ne would for ought or nought be won unto her will she turned her love to hatred manifold and for his sake vowed to do all the ill which she could do to knights which now she does fulfil for all those knights the which by force or guile she does subdue she foully does entreat first she does them of warlike arms despoil and cloth in women's weeds and then with threat does them compel to work to earn their meat to spin to carded to sew to wash to wring ne does she give them other thing to eat but bred and water or like feeble thing them to disable from revenge adventuring but if through stout disdain of manly mind any her proud observance will withstand upon that gibbet which is there behind she causeth them be hanged up out of hand in which condition i right now did stand for being overcome by her in fight and put to that base service of her band i rather chosen to die in lines despite then led that shameful life unworthy of a knight how hight that amazon said artegall and where and how far hence does she abide her name quoth he they radigund do call a princess of great pour and greater pride and queen of amazons in arms well tried and sundry battles which she hath achieved with great success that her hath glorified and made her famous more then is believed ne would i it have weened had i not late it proved now sure said he and by the faith that i to maidenhead and noble knighthood owe i will not rest till i her might do try and venge the shame that she to knights does show therefore sir terpin from you lightly throw this squalid weed the pattern of despair and weened with me that you may see and know how fortune will your ruined name repair and knights of maidenhead whose praise she would impair with that like one that hopeless was reprieved from deaths door at which he lately lay those iron fetters wherewith he was gyved the badges ofreproch he threw away and nimbly did him dight to guide the way unto the dwelling of that amazone which was from thence not passed a mile or tway a goodly city and a mighty one the which of her own name she called radegone where they arriving by the watchmen were descried straight who all the city warned how that three warlike persons did appear of which the one him seemed a knight all armed and th'other two well likely to have harmed eftsoon the people all to harness ran and like a sort of bees in clusters swarmed ere long their queen her self half like a man came forth into the rout and them array began and now the knights being arrived near did beatrice upon the gates to enter in and at the porter scorning them so few threw many threats if they the town did win to tear his flesh in pieces for his since which when as radigund there coming herd her heart for rage did grate and teeth did grin she bade that straight the gates should be unbarred and to them way to make with weapons well prepared soon as the gates were open to them set they pressed forward entrance to have made but in the middle way they were met with a sharp shower of arrows which them stayed and better bad advise ere they assayed unknown peril of bold women's pride then all that rout upon them rudely laid and heaped strokes so fast on every side and arrows hailed so thick that they could not abide but radigund her self when she espied sir terpin from her direful doom acquit so cruel doile among her maids david avenge that shame they did on him commit all suddenly inflamed with furious fit like a fell lioness at him she flew and on his headpiece him so fiercely smit that to the ground him quite she overthrew dismayed so with the stroke that he no colours knew soon as she saw him on the ground to grovel she lightly to him leapt and in his neck her proud foot setting at his head did level weening at once her wrath on him to wreak and his contempt that did her judgement break as when a bear hath seized her cruel claws upon the carcase of some beast too weak proudly stands over and a while does pause to hear the piteous beast pleading her plaintiff cause whom when as artegall in that distress by chance beheld he left the bloody slaughter in which he swam and ran to his redress there her assailing fiercely fresh he reached her such and huge stroke that it of sense distracted her and had she not it warded warily it had deprived her mother of a daughter natheless for all the pour she did apply it made her stagger oft and stare with ghastly eye like to and eagle in his kingly pride soaring through his wide empire of the air to weather his broad sails by chance hath spied a goshawk which hath seized for her share upon some fowl that should her feast prepare with dreadful force he flies at her belive that with his souse which none enduren dare her from the quarry he away does driven and from her gripping pounce the greedy prey does rive but soon as she her sense recovered had she fiercely towards him her self gan dight through vengeful wrath & sdainful pride half mad for never had she suffered such despite but ere she could join hand with him to fight her warlike maids about her flocked so fast that they disparted them maugre their might and with their troops did far a sunder cast but amongst the rest the fight did until evening last and every while that mighty iron man with his strange weapon never wont in war them sorely vexed and coursed and overran and broke their bows and did their shooting mar that none of all the many once did dare him to assault nor once approach him nigh but like a sort of sheep dispersed far for dread of their devouring enemy through all the fields and valleys did before him fly but when as days fair shiny-beam clouded with fearful shadows of deformed night warned man and beast in quiet rest be shrouded bold radigund with found of trump on hight caused all her people to surcease from fight and gathering them unto her cities gate made them all enter in before her sighed and all the wounded and the weak in state to be conveyed in ere she would once retreat when thus the field was voided all away and all things quieted the elfin knight weary of toil and travel of that day caused his pavilion to be richly pight before the city gate in open sighed where he him self did rest in safety together with sir terpin all that night but talus used in times of jeopardy to keep a nightly watch for dread of treachery but radigund full of heart-gnawing grief for the rebuke which she sustained that day could take no rest ne would receive relief but tossed in her troublous mind what way she mote revenge that blot which on her lay there she resolved her self in single fight to try her fortune and his force assay rather then see her people spoiled quite as she had seen that day a disadventurous sighed she called forth to her a trusty maid whom she thought fittest for that business her name was clarin and thus to her said go damosel quickly do thy self address to do the message which i shall express go thou unto that stranger fairy knight who yester day drove us to such distress tell that to morrow i with him will fight and try in equal field whither hath greater might but these conditions do to him propound that if i vanquish him he shall obey my law and ever to my lore be bound and so will i if me he vanquish may what ever he shall like to do or say go straight and take with thee to witness it sixe of thy fellows of the best array and bear with you both wine and juncates fit and bid him eat henceforth he oft shall hungry fit the damosel straight obeyed and putting all in readiness forth to the towngate went where sounding loud a trumpet from the wall unto those warlike knights she warning sent then talus forth issuing from the tent unto the wall his way did fearless take to weeten what that trumpets sounding meant where that same damosel loudly him bespoke and showed that with his lord she would emparlance make so he them straight conducted to his lord who as he could them goodly well did greet till they had told their message word by word which he accepting well as he could weet them fairly entertained with curtsies meet and gave them gifts and things of deer delight so back again they homeward turned their feet but artegall him self to rest did dight that he mote fresher be against the next days fight cant. v. artegall fights with radigund and is subdued by guile he is by her imprisoned but wrought by clarins wile so soon as day forth dawning from the east nights humid curtain from the heavens withdrew and early calling forth both man and beast commanded them their daily works renew these noble warriors mindful to pursue the last days purpose of their vowed fight them selves thereto prepared in order due the knight as best was seeming for a knight and th'amazon as best it liked her self to dight all in a camis light of purple silk woven upon with silver subtly wrought and quilted upon satin white as milk trailed with ribbons diversely distracted like as the workman had their courses taught which was short tucked for light motion up to her ham but when she list it reached down to her lowest heel and thereupon she wore for her defence a mailed habergeon and on her legs she painted buskin's wore basted with bends of gold on every side and mails between and laced close afore upon her thigh her scimitar was tide with and embroidered belt of mickle pride and on her shoulder hung her shield bedecked upon the boss with stones that shined wide as the fair moon in her most full aspect that to the moon it mote be like in each respect so forth she came out of the city gate with stately port and proud magnificence guarded with many damsels that did wait upon her person for her sure defence playing on shawms and trumpets that from hence their found did reach unto the heavens hight so forth into the field she marched thence where was a rich pavilion ready pight her to receive till time they should begin the fight then forth came artegall out of his tent all armed to point and first the lists did enter soon after eke came she with fell intent and countenance fierce as having fully bent her that battles utmost trial to adventer the lists were closed fast to bar the rout from rudely pressing to the middle centre which in great heaps them circled all about waiting how fortune would resolve that dangerous doubt the trumpets sounded and the field began with bitter strokes it both began and ended she at the first encounter on him ran with furious rage as if she had intended out of his breast the very heart have rended but he that had like tempests often tried from that first flaw him self right well defended the more she raged the more he did abide she hewed she foined she lashed she laid on every side yet still her blows he boar and her forbore weening at last to win advantage new yet still her cruelty increased more and though pour failed her courage did accrue which failing he gan fiercely her pursue like as a smith that to his cunning feat the stubborn mettle seeks to subdue soon as he feels it mollified with heat with his great iron sledge does strongly on it beatrice so did sir artegall upon her lay as if she had and iron anvil been that flakes of fire bright as the sunny ray out of her steely arms were flashing seen that all on fire you would her surely ween but with her shield so well her self she warded from the dread danger of his weapon keen that all that while her life she safely guarded but he that help from her against her will discarded for with his trenchant blade at the next blow half of her shield he shared quite away that half her side it self did naked show and thenceforth unto danger opened way much was she moved with the mighty sway of that sad stroke that half enraged she grew and like a greedy bear unto her prey with her sharp scimitar at him she flew that glancing down his thigh the purple blood forth drew thereat she gan to triumph with great boast and to upbraid that chance which him misfell as if the prize she got had almost with spiteful speeches fitting with her well that his great heart gan inwardly to swell with indignation at her vaunting vain and at her struck with puissance fearful fell yet with her shield she warded it again that shattered all to pieces round about the plain having her thus disarmed of her shield upon her helmet he again her struck that down she fell upon the grassy field in senseless swoon as if her life forsook and pangs of death her spirit overtook whom when he saw before his foot prostrated he to her leapt with deadly dreadful look and her sunshiny helmet soon unlaced thinking at once both head and helmet to have razed but when as he discovered had her face he saw his senses strange astonishment a miracle of nature's goodly grace in her fair visage void of ornament but bathed in blood and sweat together meant which in the rudeness of that evil plighted bewrayed the signs of feature excellent like as the moon in foggy winter's night does seem to be her self though darkened be her light at sighed thereof his cruel minded heart empierced was with pitiful regard that his sharp sword he threw from him apart cursing his hand that had that visage marred no hand so cruel nor no heart so hard but ruth of beauty will it mollify by this upstarting from her swoon she stared a while about her with confused eye like one that from his dream is waked suddenly soon as the knight she there by her did spy standing with empty hands all weaponless with fresh assault upon him she did fly and gan renew her former cruelness and though he still retyted yet natheless with huge redoubled strokes she on him laid and more increased her outrage merciless the more that he with meek intreaty prayed her wrathful hand from greedy vengeance to have stayed like as a puttock having spied in sighed a gentle falcon sitting on and hill whose other wing now made unmeet for flight was lately broken by some fortune ill the foolish kite led with licentious will does beatrice upon the gentle bird in vain with many idle stoups her troubling still even so did radigund with bootless pain annoy this noble knight and sorely him constrain nought could he do but shun the dreaded despite of her fierce wrath and backward still retire and with his single shield well as he might bear off the burden of her raging ire and evermore he gently did desire to stay her strokes and he himself would yield yet nould she hark ne let him once respire till he to her delivered had his shield and to her mercy him submitted in plain field so was he overcome not overcome but to her yielded of his own accord yet was he justly damned by the doom of his own mouth that spoke so wareless word to be her thrall and service her afford for though that he first victory obtained yet after by abandoning his sword he wilful lost that he before attained no fairer conquest then that with goodwill is gained tho with her sword on him she flatling struck in sign of true subjection to her pour and as her vassal him to thraldom took but terpine born to more unhappy hour as he on whom the luckless stars did lower she caused to be attached and forthwith led unto the crook abide the baleful stour from which he lately had through rescue fled where he full shamefully was hanged by the head but when they thought on talus hands to lay he with his iron flail among them thundered that they were fain to let him escape away glad from his company to be so sundered whose presence all their troops so much encumbered that heaps of those which he did wound and slay beside the rest dismayed might not be numbered yet all that while he would not once assay to rescue his own lord but thought it just obey then took the amazon this noble knight left to her will by his own wilful blame and caused him to be disarmed quite of all the ornaments of knightly name with which whilom he got had great fame in stead whereof she made him to be dight in woman's weeds that is to manhood shame and put before his lap a apron white in stead of curiets and bases fit for fight so being clad she brought him from the field in which he had be trained many a day into a long large chamber which was sealed with monuments of many knights decay by her subdued in victorious fray among the which she caused his warlike arms be hanged on high that mote his shame bewray and broke his sword or fear of further harms with which he wont to stir up battailous alarms there entered in he round about him saw many brave knights whose names right well he knew there bound obey that amazons proud law spinning and carding all in comely rew that his big heart loathed so uncomely view but they were forced through penury and pine to do those works to them appointed due for nought was given them to sup or dine but what their hands could earn by twisting linen twine among them all she placed him most low and in his hand a distaff to him gave that he thereon should spin both flax and tow a sordid office for a mind so brave so hard it is to be a woman's slave yet he it took in his own selves despite and thereto did himself right well behave her to obey sith he his faith had plighted her vassal to become if she him won in fight who had him seen imagine mote thereby that whilom hath of hercules be told how for iolas sake he did apply his mighty hands the distaff vile to hold for his huge club which had subdued of old so many monsters which the world annoyed his lyons skin changed to a pall of gold in which forgetting wars he only joyed in combats of sweet love and with his mistress toyed such is the cruelty of women kind when they have shaken off the shamefast band with which wise nature did them strongly bind tobay the hests of men well ruling hand that then all rule and reason they withstand to purchase a licentious liberty but virtuous women wisely understand that they were born to base humility unless the heavens them lift to lawful sovereignty thus there long while continued artegall serving proud radigund with true subjection how ever it his noble heart did gall tobay a woman's tyrannous direction that might have had of life or death election but having chosen now he might not change during which time the warlike amazon whose wandering fancy after lust did range gan cast a secret liking to this captive strange which long concealing in her covert breast she chawed the cud of lovers careful plighted yet could it not so thoroughly digest being fast fixed in her wounded spright but it tormented her both day and night yet would she not thereto yield free accord to serve the lowly vassal of her might and of her servant make her sovereign lord so great her pride that she such baseness much abhorred so much the greater still her anguish grew through stubborn handling of her lovesick heart and still the more she strove it to subdue the more she still augmented her own smart and wider made the wound of hidden dart at last when long she struggled had in vain she gan to stoop and her proud mind convert to meek obeisance of loves mighty rain and him entreat for grace that had procured her pain unto her self in secret she did call her nearest handmaid whom she most did trust and to her said clarinda whom of all i trust a live sith i thee fostered first now is the time that i untimely must thereof make trial in my greatest need it is so happened that the heavens unjust spighting my happy freedom have agreed to thrall my looser life or my last bale to breed with that she turned her head as half abashed to hide the blush which in her visage rose and through her eyes like sudden lightning flashed decking her cheek with a vermilion rose but soon she did her countenance compose and to her turning thus began again this griefs deep wound i would to thee disclose thereto compelled through heart-murdering pain but dread of shame my doubtful lips does still restrain ah my deer dread said then the faithful maid can dread of ought your dreadless heart withhold that many hath with dread of death dismayed and dare even deaths most dreadful face behold say on my sovereign lady and be bold does not your handmaids' life at your foot lie therewith much comforted she gan unfold the cause of her conceived malady as one that would confess yet feign would it deny clarin said she thou seest yond fairy knight whom not my valour but his own brave mind subjected hath to my unequal might what right is it that he should thraldom find for lending life to me a wretch unkind that for such good him recompense with ill therefore i cast how i may him unbind and by his freedom get his free goodwill yet so as bound to me he may continue still bound unto me but not with such hard bans of strong compulsion and straight violence as now in miserable state he stands but with sweet love and sure benevolence void of malicious mind or foul offence to which if thou canst win him any way without discovery of my thoughts pretence both goodly meed of him it purchase may and eke with grateful service me right well apay which that thou mayest the better bring to pass lo here this ring which shall thy warrant be and token true to old eumenias from time to time when thou it best shalt see that in and out thou mayest have passage free go now clarinda well thy wits advise and all thy forces gather unto thee armies of lovely looks and speeches wise with which thou canst even ioue himself to love entice the trusty maid conceiving her intent did with sure promise of her good endeavour give her great comfort and some hearts content so from her parting she thenceforth did labour by all the means she might to curry favour with th'elfin knight her ladies best beloved with daily show of courteous kind behaviour even at the markwhite of his heart she roved and with wide glancing words one day she thus him proved unhappy knight upon whose hopeless state fortune envying good hath felly frowned and cruel heavens have heaped and heavy fate i rew that thus thy better days are drowned in sad despair and all thy senses swooned in stupid sorrow sith thy juster merit might else have with felicity be crowned look up at last and wake thy dulled spirit to think how this long death thou mightest disinherit much did he marvel at her uncouth speech whose hidden drift he could not well perceive and gan to doubt lest she him sought appeach of treason or some guileful train did weave through which she might his wretched life bereave both which to bar he with this answer met her fair damosel that with ruth as i perceive of my mishaps art moved to wish me better for such your kind regard i can but rest your debtor yet weet you well that to a courage great it is no less beseeming well to bear the storm of fortune's frown or heavens threat then in the sunshine of her countenance clear timely to joy and carry comely cheer for though this cloud have now me overcast yet do i not of better times despair and though unlike they should for ever last yet in my truths assurance i rest fixed fast but what so stony mind she then replied but if in his own pour occasion lay would to his hope a window open wide and to his fortune's help make ready way unworthy sure quoth he of better day that will not take the offer of good hope and eke pursue if he attain it may which speeches she applying to the scope of her intent this further purpose to him shaped then why dost not thou ill advised man make means to win thy liberty forlorn and try if thou by fair entreaty can move radigund who though she still have worn her days in war yet weet thou was not born of bears and tigers nor so salvage minded as that albe all love of men she scorn she yet forgets that she of men was kinded and sooth oft seen that proudest hearts base love hath blinded certes clarinda not of cankered will said he nor obstinate disdainful mind i have forbore this duty to fulfil for well i may this ween by that i find that she a queen and come of princely kind both worthy is for to be sued unto chiefly by him whose life her law does bind and eke of pour her own doom to undo and also of princely grace to be inclined thereto but want of means hath be mine only let from seeking favour where it does abound which if i might by your good office get i to your self should rest for ever bound and ready to deserve what grace i found she feeling him thus bite upon the bait yet doubting lest his hold was but unsound and not well fastened would not strike him strait but drew him on with hope fit leisure to await but foolish maid whiles heedless of the hook she thus oft times was beating off and on through slippery footing fell into the brook and there was caught to her confusion for seeking thus to salve the amazon she wounded was with her deceits own dart and gan thenceforth to cast affection conceived close in her beguiled heart to artegall through pity of his causeless smart yet durst she nop disclose her fancies wound ne to himself for doubt of being disdained ne yet to any other wight on ground for fear her mistress should have knowledge gained but to her self it secretly retained within the closet of her covert breast the more thereby her tender heart was pained yet to await fit time she weened best and fairly did dissemble her sad thoughts unrest one day her lady calling her apart can to demand of her some tidings good touching her loves success her lingering smart therewith she gan at first to change her mood as one adawed and half confused stood but quickly she it overpassed so soon as she her face had wiped to fresh her blood though gan she tell her all that she had done and all the ways she sought his love for to have won but said that he was obstinate and stern scorning her offers and conditions vain ne would be taught withany terms to learn so found a lesson as to love again die rather would he in penurious pain and his abridged days in dolour wast then his foes love or liking entertain his resolution was both first and last his body was her thrall his heart was freely placed which when the cruel amazon perceived she gan to storm and rage and rend her gall for very fell despite which she conceived to be so scorned of a base born thrall whose life did lie in her least eyelids fallen of which she vowed with many a cursed threat that she therefore would him ere long forestall natheless when calmed was her furious heat she changed that threatfully mood & mildly gan entreat what now is left clarinda what remains that we may compass this our enterprise great shame to loose so long employed pains and greater shame abide so great misprize with which he dares our offers thus despise yet that his guilt the greater may appear and more my gracious mercy by this wise i will a while with his first folly bear till thou have tried again & tempted him more near say and do all that may thereto prevail leave nought unpromised that may him persuade life freedom grace and gifts of great avail with which the gods themselves are milder made thereto add art even women's witty trade the art of mighty words that men can charm with which in case thou canst him not invade let him feel hardness of thy heavy arm who will not stoop with good shall be made stoop with harm some of his diet do from him withdraw for i him find to be too proudly fed give him more labour and with straighter law that he with work may be forwearied let him lodge hard and lie in strawen bed that may pull down the courage of his pride and lay upon him for his greater dread cold iron chains with which let him be tide and let what ever he desires be him denied when thou hast all this done then bring me news of his demean thenceforth notlike a lover but like a rebel stout i will him use for i resolve this siege not to give over till i the conquest of my will recover so she departed full of grief and disdain which inly did to great impatience move her but the false maiden shortly turned again unto the prison where her heart did thrall remain there all her subtle nets she did unfold and all the engines of her wit display in which she meant him wareless to enfold and of his innocence to make her pray so cunnningly she wrought her crafts assay that both her lady and her self withal and eke the knight atonce she did betray but most the knight whom she with guileful call did cast for to allure into her trap to fallen as a bad nurse which feigning to receive in her own mouth the food meant for her child withholds it to her self and doth deceive the infant so for want of nurture spoiled even so clarinda her own dame beguiled and turned the trust which was in her affied to feeding of her private fire which boiled her inward breast and in her entrails fried the more that she it sought to cover and to hide for coming to this knight she purpose feigned how earnest suit she erst for him had made unto her queen his freedom to have gained but by no means could her thereto persuade but that in stead thereof she sternly bade his misery to be augmented more and many iron bans on him to lade all which natheless she for his love forbore so praying him t'accept her service evermore and more then that she promised that she would in case she might find favour in his eye devise how to enlarge him out of hold the fairy glad to gain his liberty can yield great thanks for such her courtesy and with fair words fit for the time and place to feed the humour of her malady promised if she would free him from that case he would by all good means he might deserve such grace so daily he fair semblant did her show yet never meant he in his noble mind to his own absent love to be untrue ne ever did deceitful clarin find in her false heart his bondage to unbind but rather how she mote him faster tie therefore unto her mistress most unkind she daily told her love he did defy and him she told her dame his freedom did deny yet thus much friendship she to him did show that his scarce diet somewhat was amended and his work lessened that his love mote grow yet to her dame him still she discommended that she with him mote be the more offended thus he long while in thraldom there remained of both beloved well but little friended until his own true love his freedom gained which in and other canto will be best contained cant. vi talus brings news to britomart of artegals mishap she goes to seek him dolon meets who seeks her to entrap some men i wot will deem in artegall great weakness and report of him much ill for yielding so himself a wretched thrall to th'insolent command of women's will that all his former praise does foully spill but he the man that say or do so dare be well advised that he stand steadfast still for never yet was wight so well aware but he at first or last was trapped in women's snare yet in the straightness of that captive state this gentle knight himself so well behaved that notwithstanding all the subtle bait with which those amazons his love still craved to his own love his loyalty he saved whose character in th'adamantine mould of his true heart so firmly was engraved that no new loves impression ever could bereave it thence such blot his honour blemish should yet his own love the noble britomart scarce so conceived in her jealous thought what time sad tidings of his baleful smart in woman's bondage talus to her brought brought in untimely hour ere it was sought for after that the utmost date assigned for his return she waited had for nought she gan to cast in her misdoubtful mind a thousand fears that lovesick fancies feign to find sometime she feared lest some hard mishap had him misfallen in his adventurous quest sometime lest his false foe did him entrap in traitorous train or had unwares oppressed but most she did her troubled mind molest and secretly afflict with jealous fear lest some new love had him from her possessed yet loath she was since she no ill did hear to think of him so ill yet could she not forbear one while she blamed her self another while she him condemned as trustless and untrue and then her grief with error to beguile she feigned to count the time again anew as if before she had not counted true for hours but days for weeks that passed were she told but months to make them seem more few yet when she reckoned them still drawing near each hour did seem a month & every month a year but when as yet she saw him not return she thought to send some one to seek him out but none she found so fit to serve that turn as her own self to ease her self of doubt now she devise among the warlike rout of errant knights to seek her errant knight and then again resolved to hunt him out among lose ladies lapped in delight and then both knights envied & ladies eke did spite one day when as she long had sought for ease in every place and every place thought best yet found no place that could her liking please she to a window came that opened west towards which coast her love his way addressed there looking forth she in her heart did find many vain fancies working her unrest and sent her winged thoughts more swift then wind to bear unto her love the message of her mind there as she looked long at last she spied one coming towards her with hasty speed well weened she then ere him she plain descried that it was one sent from her love indeed who when he nigh approached she mote aread that it was talus artegall his groom whereat her heart was filled with hope and dread ne would she stay till he in place could come but ran to meet him forth to know his tidings sum euen in the door him meeting she begun and where is he thy lord and how far hence declare at once and hath he lost or won the iron man albe he wanted sense and sorrows feeling yet with conscience of his ill news did inly chill and quake and stood still mute as one in great suspense as if that by his silence he would make her rather read his meaning then him self it spoke till she again thus said talus be bold and tell what ever it be good or bad that from thy tongue thy hearts intent does hold to whom he thus at length the tidings sad that i would hide will needs i see be read my lord your love by hard mishap does lie in wretched bondage woefully bestead ay me quoth she what wicked destiny and is he vanquished by his tyrant enemy not by that tyrant his intended foe but by a tyranness he then replied that him captived hath in hapless woe cease thou bad newsman badly dost thou hide thy masters shame in harlots bondage tide the rest my self too readily can spell with that in rage she turned from him aside forcing in vain the rest to her to tell and to her chamber went like solitary cell there she began to make her moanful plaint against her knight for being so untrue and him to touch with falsehoods fowl attaint that all his other honour overthrew oft did she blame her self and often rew for yielding to a strangers love so light whose life and manners strange she never knew and evermore she did him sharply twight for breach of faith to her which he had firmly plighted and then she in her wrathful will did cast how to revenge that blot of honour blended to fight with him and goodly die her last and then again she did her self torment inflicting on her self his punishment a while she walked and chafed a while she threw her self upon her bed and did lament yet did she not lament with loud alew as women wont but with deep sighs and singulfs few like as a wayward child whose sounder sleep is broken with some fearful dreams affright with froward will does set him self to weep ne can be styled for all his nurse's might but kicks and sqalls and shrieks for fell despite now scratching her and her lose locks misusing now seeking darkness and now seeking light then craving suck and then the suck refusing such was this ladies fit in her loves found accusing but when she had with such unquiet fits her self there close afflicted long in vain yet found no easement in her troubled wits she unto talus forth returned again by change of place seeking to ease her pain and gan inquire of him with milder mood the certain cause of artegals detain and what he did and in what state he stood and whither he did woo or whither he were wooed ah wellaway said then the iron man that he is not the while in state to woo but lies in wretched thraldom weak and wan not by strong hand compelled thereunto but his own doom that none can now undo said i not then quoth she erewhile aright that this is things compact betwixt you two me to deceive of faith unto me plighted since that he was not forced nor overcome in fight with that he gan at large to her dilate the whole discourse of his captivance sad in sort as you have herd the same of late all which when she with hard endurance had here to the end she was right soar bestead with sudden stounds of wrath and grief atone ne would abide till she had answer made but straight her self did dight and armour done and mounting to her steed bad talus guide heron so forth she road upon her ready way to seek her knight as talus her did guide sadly she road and never word did say nor good nor bad ne ever looked aside but still right down and in her thought did hide the fellness of her heart right fully bent to fierce avengement of that woman's pride which had her lord in her base prison penned and so great honour with so fowl reproach had blended so as she thus melancholic did ride chawing the cud of grief and inward pain she chanced to meet towards th'euen-tide a knight that softly paced on the plain as if him self to solace he were feign well shot in years he seemed and rather bent to peace then needless trouble to constrain as well by view of that his vestiment as by his modest semblant that no evil meant he coming near gan gently her salute with courteous words in the most comely wise who though desirous rather to rest mute then terms to entertain of common guise yet rather then she kindness would despise she would her self displease so him requite then gan the other further to devise of things abroad as next to hand did light and many things demand to which she answered light for little lust had she to talk of ought or ought to hear that mote delightful be her mind was whole possessed of one thought that gave none other place which when as he by outward signs as well he might did see he list no longer to use loathful speech but her besought to take it well in gree sith shady damp had dimmed the heavens reach to lodge with him that night unless good cause impeach the championess now seeing night at door was glad to yield unto his good request and with him went without gainsaying more not far away but little wide by west his dwelling was to which he him addressed where soon arriving they received were in seemly wise as them beseemed best for he their host them goodly well did cheer and talked of pleasant things the night away to wear thus passing evening well till time of rest then britomart unto a bower was brought where grooms awaited her to have undressed but she ne would undressed be for ought ne doff her arms though he her much besought for she had vowed she said not to forgo those warlike weeds till she revenge had wrought of a late wrong upon a mortal foe which she would sure perform betide her well or woe which when their host perceived right discontent in mind he grew for fear lest by that art he should his purpose miss which close he meant yet taking leave of her he did depart there all that night remained britomart restless recomfortless with heart deep grieved not suffering the least twinkling sleep to start into her eye which th'heart mote have relieved but if the least appeared her eyes she straight reprieved the guilty eyes said she the which with guile my heart at first betrayed will you betray my life now to for which a little while you will not watch false watches wellaway i wot when you did watch both night and day unto your loss and now needs will you sleep now you have made my heart to wake always now will you sleep ah wake and rather weep to think of your nights want that should ye waking keep thus did she watch and wear the weary night in wailful plaints that none was to appease now walking soft now sitting still upright as sundry change her seemed best to ease ne less did talus suffer sleep to seize his eyelids sad but watched continually lying without her door in great disease like to a spaniel waiting carefully lest any should betray his lady treacherously what time the native belman of the night the bird that warned peter of his fallen first rings his silver bell t'each sleepy wight that should their minds up to devotion call she herd a wondrous noise below the hall all suddenly the bed where she should lie by a false trap was let adown to fallen into a lower room and by and by the lost was raised again that no man could it spy with sighed whereof she was dismayed right soar perceiving well the treason which was meant yet stirred not at all for doubt of more but kept her place with courage confident waiting what would ensue of that event it was not long before she herd the found of armed men coming with close intent towards her chamber at which dreadful stound she quickly caught her sword & shield about her bound with that there came unto her chamber door two knights all armed ready for to fight and after them full many other more a rascal rout with weapons rudely dight whom soon as talus spied by glims of night he started up there where on ground he lay and in his hand his thresher ready catched they seeing that let driven at him straight way and round about him press in riotous array but soon as he began to lay about with his rude iron flail they gan to fly both armed knights and eke unarmed rout yet talus after them apace did ply where ever in the dark he could them spy that here and there like scattered sheep they lay then back returning where his dame did lie he to her told the story of that fray and all that treason there intended did bewray wherewith though wondrous wroth and inly burning to be avenged for so fowl a deed yet being forced to abide the days returning she there remained but with right wary heed lest any more such practice should proceed now mote you know that which to britomart unknown was whence all this did proceed and for what cause so great mischievous smart was meant to her that never evil meant in heart the goodman of this house was dolon hight a man of subtle wit and wicked mind that whilom in his youth had be a knight and arms had born but little good could find and much less honour by that warlike kind of life for he was nothing valorous but with sly shifts and wiles did undermind all noble knights which were adventurous and many brought to shame by treason treacherous he had three sons all three like father's sons like treacherous like full of fraud and guile of all that on this earthly compass wones the eldest of the which was slain erewhile by artegall through his own guilty wile his name was guizor whose untimely fate for to avenge full many treasons vile his father dolon had devise of late with these his wicked sons and showed his cankered hate for sure he weened that this his present guest was artegall by many tokens plain but chiefly by that iron page he guessed which still was wont with artegall remain and therefore meant him surely to have slain but by gods grace and her good heediness she was preserved from their traitorous train thus she all night wore out in watchfulness ne suffered slothful sleep her eyelids to oppress the morrow next so soon as dawning hour discovered had the light to living eye she forth issued out of her loathed bower with full intent avenge that villainy on that vild man and all his family and coming down to seek them where they woned nor sire nor sons nor any could she spy each room she sought but them all empty found they all were fled for fear but whither neither kent she saw it vain to make there longer stay but took her steed and thereon mounting light gan her address unto her former way she had not rid the mountenance of a flight but that she saw there present in her sighed those two false brothers on that perilous bridge on which pollente with artegall did fight streight was the passage like a ploughed ridge that if two met the one mote needs fallen over the ledge there they did think them selves on her to wreak who as she nigh unto them drew the one these vile reproaches gan unto her speak thou recreant false traitor that with lone of arms hast knighthood stolen yet knight art none no more shall now the darkness of the night defend thee from the vengeance of thy foes but with thy blood thou shalt appease the spright of guizor by thee slain and murdered by thy slight strange were the words in britomartis ear yet stayed she not for them but forward fared till to the perilous bridge she came and there talus desired that he might have prepared the way to her and those two lozels scared but she thereat was wroth that for despite the glancing sparkles through her beaver glared and from her eyes did flash out fiery light like coals that through a silver censer sparkle bright she stayed not to advise which way to take but putting spurs unto her fiery beast through the midst of them she way did make the one of them which most her wrath increased upon her spear she boar before her breast till to the bridges further end she passed where falling down his challenge he released the other over side the bridge she cast into the river where he drunk his deadly last as when the flashing levin haps to light upon two stubborn oaks which stand so near that way betwixt them none appears in sighed the engine fiercely flying forth does tear th'one from the earth & through the air does bear the other it withforce does overthrow upon one side and from his roots does rear so did the championess those two there strow and to their sire their carcases left to bestow cant. vii britomart comes to isis church where she strange visions sees she fights with radigund her slases and artegall thence frees nought is on earth more sacred or divine that gods and men do equally adore then this same virtue that does right define for heavens themselves whence mortal men implore right in their wrongs are ruled by righteous lore of highest ioue who does true justice deal to his inferior gods and evermore therewith contains his heavenly commonweal the skill whereof to princes hearts he does reveal well therefore did the antique world invent that justice was a god of sovereign grace and altars unto him and temples lent and heavenly honours in the highest place calling him great osyris of the raze of th'old egyptian kings that whilom were with feigned colours shading a true case for that osyris whilst he lived here the justest man alive and truest did appear his wife was isis whom they likewise made a goddess of great pour and sovereignty and in her person cunningly did shade that part of justice which is equity whereof i have to treat here presently unto whose temple when as britomart arrived she with great humility did enter in ne would that night depart but talus mote not be admitted to her part there she received was in goodly wise of many priests which duly did attend upon the rites and daily sacrifice all clad in linen robes with silver hemmed and on their heads with long locks comely combed they wore rich mitres shaped like the moon to show that isis does the moon portend like as osyris signifies the sun for that they both like raze in equal justice run the championess them greeting as she could was thence by them into the temple led whose goodly building when she did behold born upon stately pillars all dispread with shining gold and arched over head she wondered at the workman's passing skill whose like before she never saw nor read and thereupon long while stood gazing still but thought that she thereon could never gaze her fill thence forth unto the idol they her brought the which was framed all of silver fine so well as could with cunning hand be wrought and clothed all in garments made of line hemmed all about with fringe of silver twine upon her head she wore a crown of gold to show that she had pour in things divine and at her feet a crocodile was rolled that with her wreathed tail her middle did enfold one foot was set upon the crocodile and on the ground the other fast did stand so meaning to suppress both forged guile and open force and in her other hand she stretched forth a long white slender wand such was the goddess whom when britomart had long beheld her self upon the land she did prostrate and with right humble heart unto her self her silent prayers did impart to which the idol as it were inclining her wand did move with amiable look by outward show her inward sense designing who well perceiving how her wand she shook it as a token of good fortune took by this the day with damp was overcast and joyous light the house of ioue forsook which when she saw her helmet she unlaced and by the altars side her self to slumber placed for other beds the priests there used none but on their mother earth's deer lap did lie and bake their sides upon the cold hard stone enure them selves to sufferance thereby and proud rebellious flesh to mortify for by the vow of their religion they tied were to steadfast chastity and continence of life that all forgo they mote the better tend to their devotion therefore they mote not taste of fleshly food ne feed on ought the which does blood contain ne drink of wine for wine they say is blood even the blood of giants which were slain by thundering ioue in the phlegrean plain for which the earth as they the story tell wroth with the gods which to perpetual pain had damned her sons which gainst them did rebel with inward grief and malice did against them swell and of their vital blood the which was shed into her pregnant bosom forth she brought the fruitful vine whose liquour bloody read having the minds of men with fury fraught mote in them stir up old rebellious thought to make new war against the gods again such is the pour of that same fruit that nought the fell contagion may thereof restrain ne within reasons rule her madding mood contain there did the warlike maid her self repose under the wings of isis all that night and with sweet rest her heavy eyes did close after that long days toil and weary plighted where whilst her earthly parts with soft delight of senseless sleep did deeply drowned lie there did appear unto her heavenly spright a wondrous vision which did close imply the course of all her fortune and posterity her seem ' das she was doing sacrifice to isis decked with mitre on her head and linen stole after those priests guise all suddenly she saw transfigured her linen stole to robe of scarlet read and moon-like mitre to a crown of gold that even she her self much wondered at such a change and joyed to behold her self adorned with gems and jewels manifold and in the midst of her felicity and hideous tempest seemed from below to rise through all the temple suddenly that from the altar all about did blow the holy fire and all the embers strow upon the ground which kindled privily into outrageous flames unwares did grow that all the temple put in jeopardy of flaming and her self in great perplexity with that the crocodile which sleeping lay under the idols feet in fearless bower seemed to awake in horrible dismay as being troubled with that stormy stour and gaping greedy wide did straight devour both flames and tempest with which grown great and swollen with pride of his own peerless pour he gan to threaten her likewise to eat but that the goddess with her rod him back did beatrice tho turning all his pride to humbleness meek him self before her feet he lowly threw and gan for grace and love of her to seek which she accepting he so near her drew that of his game she soon enwombed grew and forth did bring a lion of great might that shortly did all other beasts subdue with that she waked full of fearful fright and doubtfully dismayed through that so uncouth sighed so thereupon long while she musing lay with thousand thoughts feeding her fantasy until she spied the lamp of lightsome day uplifted in the porch of heaven high then up she rose fraught with melancholy and forth into the lower parts did pass whereas the priests she found full busily about their holy things for morrow mass whom she saluting fair fair resaluted was but by the change of her uncheerful look they might perceive she was not well in plighted or that some pensiveness to heart she took therefore thus one of them who seemed in sighed to be the greatest and the gravest wight to her bespoke sir knight it seems to me that through evil rest of this last night or ill payed or much dismayed you be that by your change of cheer is easy for to see certes said she sith you so well have spied the troublous passion of my pensive mind i will not seek the same from you to hide but will my cares unfold in hope to find your aid to guide me out of error blind say on quoth he the secret of your heart for by the holy vow which me does bind i am adjured best counsel to impart to all that shall require my comfort in their smart then gan she to declare the whole discourse of all that vision which to her appeared as well as to her mind it had recourse all which when he unto the end had herd like to a weak fainthearted man he fared through great astonishment of that strange sighed and with long locks upstanding stiffly stared like one adawed with some dreadful spright so filled with heavenly fury thus he her behight magnific virgin that in quaint disguise of british arms dost mask thy royal blood so to pursue a perilous emprise how coulst thou ween through that disguised hood to hide thy state from being understood can from th'immortall gods ought hidden be they do thy lineage and thy lordly brood they do thy sire lamenting soar for thee they do thy love forlorn in women's thraldom see the end whereof and all the long event they do to thee in this same dream discover for that same crocodile does represent the righteous knight that is thy faithful lover like to osyris in all just endeavour for that same crocodile osyris is that under isis feet does sleep tor ever to show that clemence oft in things amiss restrains those stern behests and cruel dooms of his that knight shall all the troublous storms assuage and raging flames that many foes shall rear to hinder thee from the just heritage of thy sire's crown and from thy country deer then shalt thou take him to thy loved fere and join in equal portion of thy realm and afterwards a son to him shalt bear that lion-like shall show his pour extreme so bless thee god and give thee joyance of thy dream all which when she unto the end had herd she much was eased in her troublous thought and on those priests bestowed rich reward and royal gifts of gold and silver wrought she for a present to their goddess brought then taking leave of them she forward went to seek her love where he was to be sought ne rested till she came without relent unto the land of amazons as she was bent whereof when news to radigund was brought not with amaze as women wonted be she was confused in her troublous thought but filled with courage and with joyous glee as glad to hear of arms the which now she had long surceased she bade to open bold that she the face of her new foe might see but when they of that iron man had told which late her folk had slain she bade them forth to hold so there without the gate as seemed best she caused her pavilion be pight in which stout britomart her self did rest while talus watched at the door all night all night likewise they of the town in fright upon their wall good watch and ward did keep the morrow next so soon as dawning light bad do away the damp of drowsy sleep the warlike amazon out of her bower did peep and caused straight a trumpet loud to shrill to warn her foe to battle soon be pressed who long before awoke for she full ill could sleep all night that in unquiet breast did closely harbour such a jealous guest was to the battle whilom ready dight eftsoones that warrioress with haughty crest did forth issue all ready for the fight on th'other side her foe appeared soon in sighed but ere they reared hand the amazone began the straight conditions to propound with which she used still to tie her foes to serve her so as she the rest had bound which when the other herd she sternly frowned for high disdain of such indignity and would no longer treat but bade them found for her no other terms should ever tie then what prescribed were by laws of chivalry the trumpets found and they together run with greedy rage and with their falchions smote ne either sought the others strokes to shun but through great fury both their skill forgotten and practic use in arms ne spared not their dainty parts which nature had created so fair and tender without stain or spot for other uses then they them translated which they now hacked & hewed as if such use they hated as when a tiger and a lioness are met at spoiling of some hungry prey both challenge it with equal greediness but first the tiger claws thereon did lay and therefore loath to lose her right away does in defence thereof full stoutly stand to which the lion strongly does gainsay that she to hunt the beast first took in hound and therefore ought it have where ever she it found full fiercely laid the amazon about and dealt her blows unmercifully soar which britomart withstood with courage stout and them repayed again with double more so long they fought that all the grassy flore was filled with blood which from their sides did flow and gushed through their arms that all in gore they trodden and on the ground their lives did strow like fruitless seed of which untimely death should grow at last proud radigund with fell despite having by chance espied advantage near let driven at her with all her dreadful might and thus upbraiding said this token bear unto the man whom thou dost love so deer and tell him for his sake thy life thou gavest which spiteful words she soar engrieved to hear thus answered lewdly thou my love depravest who shortly must repent that now so vainly bravest natheless that stroke so cruel passage found that glancing on her shoulder plate it bit unto the bone and made a grisly wound that she her shield through raging smart of it could scarce uphold yet soon she it requited for having force increased through furious pain she her so rudely on the helmet smit that it empierced to the very brain and her proud person low prostrated on the plain where being laid the wrathful britonesse stayed not till she came to her self again but in revenge both of her loves distress and her late vile reproach though vaunted vain and also of her wound which soar did pain she with one stroke both head and helmet cleft which dreadful sighed when all her warlike train there present saw each one of sense bereft fled fast into the town and her sole victor left but yet so fast they could not home retreat but that swift talus did the foremost win and pressing through the press unto the gate pellmell with them atonce did enter in there then a piteous slaughter did begin for all that ever came within his reach he with his iron flail did thresh so thin that he no work at all left for the leach like to and hideous storm which nothing may impeach and now by this the noble conqueress her self came in her glory to partake where though revengeful vow she did profess yet when she saw the heaps which he did make of slaughtered carcases her heart did quake for very ruth which did it almost rive that she his fury willed him to slake for else he sure had left not one alive but all in his revenge of spirit would deprive tho when she had his execution stayed she for that iron prison did inquire in which her wretched love was captive laid which breaking open with indignant ire she entered into all the parts entire where when she saw that loathly uncouth sighed of men disguised in womanish attire her heart gan grudge for very deep despite of so unmanly mask in misery misdight at last when as to her own love she came whom like disguise no less deformed had at sighed thereof abashed with secret shame she turned her head aside as nothing glad to have beheld a spectacle so bad and then too well believed that which tofore jealous suspect as true untruly dread which vain conceit now nourishing no more she sought with ruth to salve his sad misfortunes soar not so great wonder and astonishment did the most chaste penelope possess to see her lord that was reported drowned and dead long since in dolorous distress come home to her in piteous wretchedness after long travel of full twenty years that she knew not his favours likeliness for many scars and many hoary hears but stood long staring on him amongst uncertain fears ah my deer lord what sighed is this quoth she what may-game hath misfortune made of you where is that dreadful manly look where be those mighty palms the which you wont t'embrew in blood of kings and great hosts to subdue could ought on earth so wondrous change have wrought as to have robbed you of that manly hew could so great courage stooped have to ought then farewell fleshly force i see thy pride is nought thenceforth she straight into a bower him brought and caused him those uncomely weeds undight and in their steed for other raiment sought whereof there was great store and armours bright which had be reft from many a noble knight whom that proud amazon subdued had whilst fortune favoured her success in fight in which when as she him anew had clad she was revived and joyed much in his semblance glad so there a while they afterwards remained him to refresh and her late wounds to heal during which space she there as princes reigned and changing all that form of common weal the liberty of women did repeal which they had long usurped and them restoring to men's subjection did true justice deal that all they as a goddess her adoring her wisdom did admire and hearkened to her loring for all those knights which long in captive shade had shrouded be she did from thraldom free and magistrates of all that city made and gave to them great living and large fee and that they should for ever faithful be made them swear fealty to artegall who when him self now well recured did see he purposed to proceed what so be fallen upon his first adventure which him forth did call full sad and sorrowful was britomart for his departure her new cause of grief yet wisely moderated her own smart seeing his honour which she tendered chief consisted much in that adventures proof the care whereof and hope of his success gave unto her great comfort and relief that womanish complaints she did repress and tempered for the time her present heaviness there she continued for a certain space till through his want her woe did more increase then hoping that the change of air and place would change her pain and sorrow somewhat ease she parted thence her anguish to appease mean while her noble lord sir artegall went on his way ne ever hour did cease till he redeemed had that lady thrall that for another canto will more fitly fallen cant. viii prince arthure and sir artegall free samient from fear they slay the sultan driven his wife a dicia to despair nought under heaven so strongly does allure the sense of man and all his mind possess as beauty's lonely bait that does procure great warriors oft their rigour to repress and mighty hands forget their manliness drawn with the pour of and heart-robbing eye and wrapped in fetters of a golden tress that can with melting pleasance mollify their hardened hearts enured to blood and cruelty so whilom learned that mighty jewish swain each of whose locks did match a man in might to lay his spoils before his leman's train so also did that great octean knight for his loves sake his lions skin undight and so did warlike antony neglect the world's whole rule for cleopatras sighed such wondrous pour hath women's fair aspect to captive men and make them all the world reject yet could it not stern artegall retain nor hold from suit of his avowed quest which he had undertaken to gloriane but left his love albe her strong request fair britomart in languor and unrest and road him self upon his first intent ne day nor night did ever idly rest ne wight but only talus with him went the true guide of his way and virtuous government so travelling he chanced far off to heed a damosel flying on a palfrey fast before two knights that after her did speed with all their pour and her full fiercely chaste in hope to have her overhent at last yet fled she fast and both them far outwent carried with wings of fear like fowl aghast with locks all lose and raiment all to rend and ever as she road her eye was backward bent soon after these he saw another knight that after those two former road apace with spear in rest and pricked with all his might so ran they all as they had be at base they being chased that did others chase at length he saw the hindmost overtake one of those two and force him turn his face how ever loath he were his way to slake yet mote he algates now abide and answer make but th'other still pursued the fearful maid who still from him as fast away did fly ne once for ought her speedy passage stayed till that at length she did before her spy sir artegall to whom she straight did high with gladful haste in hope of him to get succour against her greedy enemy who seeing her approach gan forward set to save her from her fear and him from force to let but he like hound full greedy of his prey being impatient of impediment continued still his course and by the way thought with his spear him quite have overwent so both together alike felly bent like fiercely met but artegall was stronger and better skilled in tilt and tournament and boar him quite out of his saddle longer then two spears length so mischief overmatched the wronger and in his fallen misfortune him mistook for on his head unhappily he pight that his own weight his neck asunder broke and left there dead mean while the other knight defeated had the other faitour quite and all his bowels in his body braced whom leaving there in that dispiteous plighted he ran still on thinking to follow fast his other fellow pagan which before him passed in stead of whom finding there ready pressed sir artegall without discretion he at him ran with ready spear in rest who seeing him come still so fiercely on against him made again so both anon together met and strongly either struck and broke their spears yet neither has forgo his horses back yet to and from long shook and tottered like two towers which through a tempest quaked but when again they had recovered sense they drew their swords in mind to make amends for what their spears had failed of their pretence which when the damosel who those deadly ends of both her foes had seen and now her friends for her beginning a more fearful fray she to them runs in haste and her hair rends crying to them their cruel hands to stay until they both do hear what she to them will say they stayed their hands when she thus gan to speak ah gentle knights what mean you thus unwise upon your selves another's wrong to wreak i am the wronged whom you did enterprise both to redress and both redressed likewise witness the painims both whom you may see there dead on ground what do you then devise of more revenge if more then i am she which was the root of all end your revenge on me whom when they herd so say they looked about to weet if it were true as she had told where when they saw their foes dead out of doubt eftsoons they gan their wrathful hands to hold and ventailes rear each other to behold tho when as artegall did arthure view so fair a creature and so wondrous bold he much admired both his heart and hew and touched with entire affection nigh him drew saying sir knight of pardon i you pray that all unweeting have you wronged thus soar suffering my hand against my heart to stray which if you please forgive i will therefore yield for amends my self yours evermore or what so penance shall by you be read to whom the prince certes me needs more to crave the same whom error so misled as that i did mistake the living for the dead but sith you please that both our blames shall die amends may for the trespass soon be made since neither is endamaged much thereby so can they both them selves full eath persuade to fair accordance and both faults to shade either embracing other lovingly and swearing faith to either on his blade never thenceforth to nourish enmity but either others cause to maintain mutually then artegall gan of the prince inquire what were those knights which there on ground were laid and had received their follies worthy hire and for what cause they chased so that maid certes i wot not well the prince then said but by adventure found them faring so as by the way unweetingly i strayed and lo the damosel self whence all did grow of whom we may at will the whole occasion know then they that damosel called to then nigh and asked her what were those two her foes from whom she erst so fast away did fly and what was she her self so woe begone and for what cause pursued of them atone to whom she thus then wot you well that i do serve a queen that not far hence does won a princess of great pour and majesty famous through all the world and honoured far and nigh her name mercilla most men use to call that is a maiden queen of high renown for her great bounty known over all and sovereign grace with which her royal crown she does support and strongly beats down the malice of her foes which her envy and at her happiness do fret and frown yet she her self the more does magnify and even to her foes her mercies multiply amongst many which malign her happy state there is a mighty man which wones here by that with most fell despite and deadly hate seeks to subvert her crown and dignity and all his pour does thereunto apply and her good knights of which so brave a band serves her as any princess under sky he either spoils if they against him stand or to his part allures and bribes under hand ne him suffices all the wrong and ill which he unto her people does each day but that he seeks by traitorous trains to spill her person and her sacred self to slay that o you heavens defend and turn away from her unto the miscreant him self that neither hath religion nor faith but makes his god of his ungodly pelf and idols serves so let his idols serve the elf to all which cruel tyranny they say he is provoked and stirred up day and night by his bad wife that hight adicia who counsels him through confidence of might to break all bonds of law and rules of right for she her self professes mortal foe to justice and against her still does fight working to all that love her deadly woe and making all her knights and people to do so which my liege lady seeing thought it best with that his wife in friendly wise to deal for stint of strife and establishment of rest both to her self and to her common weal and all forepast displeasures to repeal so me in message unto her she sent to treat with her by way of enterdeal of final peace and fair atonement which might concluded be by mutual consent all times have wont safe passage to afford to messengers that come for causes just but this proud dame disdaining all accord not only into bitter terms forth burst reviling me and railing as she just but lastly to make proof of utmost shame me like a dog she out of doors did thrust miscalling me by many a bitter name that never did her ill ne once deserved blame and lastly that no shame might wanting be when i was gone soon after me she sent these two false knights whom there you lying see to be by them dishonoured and shent but thanked be god and your good hardiment they have the price of their own folly paid so said this damosel that hight samient and to those knights for their so noble aid her self most grateful showed & heaped thanks repaid but they now having thoroughly herd and seen all those great wrongs the which that maid complained to have be done against her lady queen by that proud dame which her so much disdained were moved much thereat and betwixt them feigned with all their force to work avengement strong upon the souldanselfe which it maintained and on his lady author of that wrong and upon all those knights that did to her belong but thinking best by counterfeit disguise to their design to make the easier way they did this complot betwixt them selves devise first that sir artegall should him array like one of those two knights which dead there lay and then that damosel the sad samient should as his purchased prize with him convey unto the souldan's court her to present unto his scornful lady that for her had sent so as they had devise sir artegall him clad in armour of a pagan knight and taking with him as his vanquished thrall that damosel led her to the souldan's right where soon as his proud wife of her had sighed forth of her window as she looking lay she weened straight it was her paynim knight which brought that damosel as his purchased prey and sent to him a page that mote direct his way who bringing them to their appointed place offered his service to disarm the knight but he refusing him to let unlace for doubt to be discovered by his sighed kept himself still in his strange armour dight soon after whom the prince arrived there and sending to the sultan in despite a bold defiance did of him require that damosel whom he held as wrongful prisoner wherewith the sultan all with fury fraught swearing and banning most blasphemously commanded straight his armour to be brought and mounting straight upon a chariot high with iron wheels and hooks armed dreadfully and drawn of cruel steeds which he had fed with flesh of men whom through fell tyranny he slaughtered had and ere they were half dead their bodies to his beasts for provender did spread so forth he came all in a coat of plate burnished with bloody rust while on the green the briton prince him ready did await in glistering arms right goodly well beseen that shone as bright as does the heaven sheen and by his stirrup talus did attend playing his pages part as he had been before directed by his lord to th'end he should his flail to final execution bend thus go they both together to their gear with like fierce minds but meanings different for the proud sultan with presumptuous cheer and countenance sublime and insolent sought only slaughter and avengement but the brave prince for honour and for right gainst tortious pour and lawless regiment in the behalf of wronged weak did fight more in his causes truth he trusted then in might like to the thracian tyrant who they say unto his horses gave his guests for meat till he himself was made their greedy prey and torn in pieces by alcides great so thought the sultan in his follies threat either the prince in pieces to have torn with his sharp wheels in his first rages heat or under his fierce horses feet have born and trampled down in dust his thoughts disdained scorn but the bold child that peril well espying if he too rashly to his chariot drew gave way unto his horses speedy flying and their resistless rigour did eschew yet as he passed by the pagan threw a shivering dart with so impetuous force that had he not it shunned with heedful view it had himself transfixed or his horse or made them both one mass withouten more remorse oft drew the prince unto his chariot nigh in hope some stroke to fasten on him near but he was mounted in his seat so high and his wingfooted coursers him did bear so fast away that ere his ready spear he could advance he far was gone and passed yet still he him did follow every where and followed was of him likewise full fast so long as in his steeds the flaming breath did last again the pagan threw another dart of which he had with him abundant store on every side of his embattled cart and of all other weapons less or more which warlike uses had devise of yore the wicked shaft guided through airy wide by some bad spirit that it to mischief boar stayed not till through his curate it did glide and made a grisly wound in his enriven side much was he grieved with that hapless throe that opened had the wellspring of his blood but much the more that to his hateful foe he mote not come to wreak his wrathful mood that made him rave like to a lion wood which being wounded of the huntsman's hand can not come near him in the covert wood where he with boughs hath built his shady stand and fenced himself about with many a flaming brand still when he sought t'approch unto him nigh his chariot wheels about him whirled round and made him back again as fast to fly and eke his steeds like to and hungry hound that hunting after game hath carrion found so cruelly did him pursue and chase that his good steed all were he much renowned for noble courage and for hardy raze durst not endure their sighed but fled from place to place thus long they traced and traversed to and from seeking by every way to make some breach yet could the prince not nigh unto him go that one sure stroke he might unto him reach whereby his strength's assay he might him teach at last from his victorious shield he drew the veil which did his powerful light impeach and coming full before his horses view as they upon him pressed it plain to them did show like lightning flash that hath the gazet burned so did the sighed thereof their sense dismay that back again upon themselves they turned and with their rider ran perforce away ne could the sultan them from flying stay with reins or wonted rule as well he knew nought feared they what he could do or say but only fear that was before their view from which like mazed deer dismayfully they flew fast did they fly as them their feet could bear high over hills and lowly over dales as they were followed of their former fear in vain the pagan banns and swears and rails and back with both his hands unto him hails the resty reins regarded now no more he to them calls and speaks yet nought avails they hear him not they have forgotten his lore but go which way they list their guide they have forlore as when the fiery-mouthed steeds which drew the suns bright wain to phaetons decay soon as they did the monstrous scorpion view with ugly craples crawling in their way the dreadful sighed did them so soar affray that their well known courses they forwent and leading th'euer-burning lamp astray this lower world nigh all to ashes brent and left their scorched path yet in the firmament such was the fury of these headstrong steeds soon as the infants sunlike shield they saw that all obedience both to words and deeds they quite forgotten and scorned all former law through woods and rocks and mountains they did draw the iron chariot and the wheels did tear and tossed the paynim without fear or awe from side to side they tossed him here and there crying to them in vain that nould his crying hear yet still the prince pursued him close behind oft making offer him to smite but found no easy means according to his mind at last they have all overthrown to ground quite topside turvey and the pagan hound among the iron hooks and grapples keen torn all to rags and rend with many a wound that no whole piece of him was to be seen but scattered all about and strowed upon the green like as the cursed son of theseus that following his chase in dewy morn to fly his stepdame's loves outrageous of his own steeds was all to pieces torn and his fair limbs left in the woods forlorn that for his sake diana did lament and all the woody nymphs did wail and mourn so was this sultan rapt and all to rend that of his shape appeared no little monument only his shield and armour which there lay though nothing whole but all to bruised and broken he up did take and with him brought away that mote remain for and eternal token to all amongst whom this story should be spoken how worthily by heavens high decree justice that day of wrong her self had wrought that all men which that spectacle did see by like ensample mote for ever warned be so on a tree before the tyrants door he caused them be hung in all men's sighed to be a monument for evermore which when his lady from the castles hight beheld it much paid her troubled spright yet not as women wont in doleful fit she was dismayed or fainted through affright but gathered unto her her troubled wit and gan eftsoons devise to be avenged for it streight down she ran like and enraged cow that is berobbed of her youngling dear with knife in hand and fatally did vow to wreak her on that maiden messenger whom she had caused be kept as prisoner by artegall misweened for her own knight that brought her back and coming present there she at her ran with all her force and might all flaming with revenge and furious despite like raging ino when with knife in hand she threw her husbands murdered infant out or fell medea when on colchic strand her brother's bones she scattered all about or as that madding mother amongst the rout of bacchus priests her own deer flesh did tear yet neither ino nor medea stout nor all the moenades so furious were as this bold woman when she saw that damosel there but artegall being thereof aware did stay her cruel hand ere she her reached and as she did her self to strike prepare out of her fist the wicked weapon caught with that like one enfeloned or distracted she forth did room whither her rage her boar with frantic passion and with fury fraught and breaking forth out at a postern door unto the wild wood ran her dolours to deplore as a mad bitch when as the frantic fit her burning tongue with rage inflamed hath does run at random and with furious bit snatching at every thing does wreak her wrath on man and beast that comes in her path there they do say that she transformed was into a tiger and that tigers scathe in cruelty and outrage she did pass to prove her surname true that she imposed has then artegall himself discovering plain did issue forth gainst all that warlike rout of knights and armed men which did maintain that ladies part and to the sultan lout all which he did assault with courage stout all were they nigh and hundred knights of name and like wild goats them chased all about flying from place to place with cowherd shame so that with final force them all he overcame then caused he the gates be opened wide and there the prince as victor of that day with triumph entertained and glorified presenting him with all the rich array and royal pomp which there long hidden lay purchased through lawless pour and tortious wrong of that proud sultan whom he erst did slay so both for rest there having stayed not long marched with that maid fit matter for another song cant. ix arthur and artegall catch guile whom talus does dismay they to mercillaes palace come and see her rich array what tiger or what other salvage wight is so exceeding furious and fell as wrong when it hath armed it self with might not fit amongst men that do with reason mell but amongst wild beasts and salvage woods to dwell where still the stronger does the weak devour and they that most in boldness do excel are dreaded most and feared for their pour fit for adicia there to built her wicked bower there let her won far from resort of men where righteous artegall her late exiled there let her ever keep her damned den where none may be with her lewd parts defiled nor none but beasts may be of her despoiled and turn we to the noble prince where late we did him leave after that he had foiled the cruel sultan and with dreadful fate had utterly subverted his unrighteous state where having with sir artegall a space well solaced in that souldan's late delight they both resolving now to leave the place both it and all the wealth therein behight unto that damosel in her ladies right and so would have departed on their way but she them wooed by all the means she might and earnestly besought to weened that day with her to see her lady thence not far away by whose entreaty both they overcomen agree to go with her and by the way as often falls of sundry things did come amongst which that damosel did to them bewray a strange adventure which not far thence lay to weet a wicked villain bold and stout which woned in a rock not far away that robbed all the country there about and brought the pillage home whence none could get it out thereto both his own wily wit she said and eke the fastness of his dwelling place both unassailable gave him great aid for he so crafty was to forge and face so light of hand and nimble of his pace so smooth of tongue and subtle in his tale that could deceive one looking in his face therefore by name malengin they him call well known by his feats and famous over all through these his slights he many does confound and eke the rock in which he wonts to dwell is wondrous strong and hewn far under ground a dreadful depth how deep no man can tell but some do say it goes down to hell and all within it full of windings is and hidden ways that scarce and hound by smell can follow out those false footsteps of his ne none can back return that once are gone amiss which when those knights had herd their hearts gan earn to understand that villains dwelling place and greatly it desired of her to learn and by which way they towards it should trace were not said she that it should let your pace towards my ladies presence by you meant i would you guide directly to the place then let not that said they stay your intent for neither will one foot till we that carl have hent so forth they passed till they approached nigh unto the rock where was the villains wone which when the damosel near at hand did spy she warned the knights thereof who thereupon gan to advise what best were to be done so both agreed to send that maid afore where she might fit nigh to the den alone wailing and raising pitiful uproar as if she did some great calamity deplore with noise whereof when as the caitiff carl should issue forth in hope to find some spoil they in await would closely him ensnarl ere to his den he backward could recoil and so would hope him easily to foil the damosel straight went as she was directed unto the rock and there upon the soil having her self in wretched wise abjected gan weep and wail as if great grief had her affected the cry whereof entering the hollow cave eftsoons brought forth the villain as they meant with hope of her some wishful boot to have full dreadful wight he was as ever went upon the earth with hollow eyes deep penned and long curled locks that down his shoulders shagged and on his back and uncouth vestiment made of strange stuff but all to worn and ragged and underneath his breech was all to torn and jagged and in his hand and huge long staff he held whose top was armed with many and iron hook fit to catch hold of all that he could wielded or in the compass of his clouches took and ever round about he cast his look also at his back a great wide net he boar with which he seldom fished at the brook but used to fish for fools on the dry shore of which he in fair weather wont to take great store him when the damosel saw fast by her side so ugly creature she was nigh dismayed and now for help aloud in earnest cried but when the villain saw her so afraid he gan with guileful words her to persuade to banish fear and with sardonian smile laughing on her his false intent to shade gan forth to lay his bait her to beguile that from her self unwares he might her steal the while like as the fouler on his guileful pipe charms to the birds full many a pleasant lay that they the while may take less heedy keep how he his nets does for their ruin lay so did the villain to her prate and play and many pleasant tricks before her show to turn her eyes from his intent away for he in slights and juggling feats did flow and of legerdemain the mysteries did know to which whilst she lent her intentive mind he suddenly his net upon her threw that overspread her like a puff of wind and snatching her soon up ere well she knew ran with her fast away unto his mew crying for help aloud but when as nigh he came unto his cave and there did view the armed knights stopping his passage by he threw his burden down and fast away did fly but artegall him after did pursue the while the prince there kept the entrance still up to the rock he ran and thereon flew like a wild goat leaping from hill to hill and dancing on the craggy cliffs at will that deadly danger seemed in all men's sighed to tempt such steps where footing was so ill ne ought availed for the armed knight to think to follow him that was so swift and light which when he saw his iron man he sent to follow him for he was swift in chase he him pursued where ever that he went both over rocks and hills and every place where so he fled he followed him apace so that he shortly forced him to forsake the hight and down descend unto the base there he him coursed a fresh and soon did make to leave his proper form and other shape to take into a fox himself he first did turn but he him hunted like a fox full fast then to a bush himself he did transform but he the bush did beatrice till that at last into a bird it changed and from him passed flying from tree to tree from wand to wand but he then stones at it so long did cast that like a stone it fell upon the land but he then took it up and held fast in his hand so he it brought with him unto the knights and to his lord sir artegall it lent warning him hold it fast for fear of slights who whilst in hand it groping heart he hent into a hedgehog all unwares it went and pricked him so that he away it threw then gan it run away incontinent being returned to his former hew but talus soon him overtook and backward drew but when as he would to a snake again have turned himself he with his iron flail gan driven at him with so huge might and main that all his bones as small as sandy grail he broke and did his bowels disentrail crying in vain for help when help was passed so did deceit the self deceiver fail there they him left a carrion outcast for beasts and fowls to feed upon for their repast thence forth they passed with that gentle maid to see her lady as they did agree to which when she approached thus she said lo now right noble knights arrived you be nigh to the place which you desired to see there shall you see my sovereign lady queen most sacred wight most debonaire and free that ever yet upon this earth was seen or that with diadem hath ever crowned been the gentle knights rejoiced much to hear the praises of that prince so manifold and passing little further come were where they a stately palace did behold of pompous show much more then she had told with many towers and terrace mounted high and all their tops bright glittering with gold that seemed to out shine the dimmed sky and with their brightness dazed the strange beholders eye there they alighting by that damosel were directed in and showed all the sighed whose porch that most magnific did appear stood open wide to all men day and night yet warded well by one of much might that sat thereby with giantlike resemblance to keep out guile and malice and despite that under show oftimes of feigned semblance are wont in princes courts to work great scathe and hindrance his name was awe by whom they passing in went up the hall that was a large wide room all full of people making troublous din and wondrous noise as if that there were some which unto them was dealing righteous doom by whom they passing through the thickest press the marshal of the hall to them did come his name hight order who commanding peace them guided through the throng that did their clamours cease they ceased their clamours upon them to gaze whom seeing all in armour bright as day strange there to see it did them much amaze and with unwonted terror half affray for never saw they there the like array ne ever was the name of war there spoken but joyous peace and quietness always dealing just judgements that mote not be broken for any bribes or threats of any to be wrought there as they entered at the scriene they saw some one whose tongue was for his trespass vile nailed to a post adjudged so by law for that therewith he falsely did revile and foul blaspheme that queen for forged guile both with bold speeches which he blazed had and with lewd poems which he did compile for the bold title of a poet bade he on himself had taken and railing rhymes had spread thus there he stood whilst high over his head there written was the purport of his since in ciphers strange that few could rightly read bon fons but bon that once had written been was razed out and mal was now put in so now malfont was plainly to be read either for evil which he did therein or that he likened was to a wellhead of evil words and wicked slanders by him shed they passing by were guided by degree unto the presence of that gracious queen who sat on high that she might all men see and might of all men royally be seen upon a throne of gold full bright and sheen adorned all with gems of endless price as either might for wealth have got be or could be framed by workman's rare device and all embossed with lyons and with fleur-de-lis all over her a cloth of state was spread not of rich tissue nor of cloth of gold nor of ought else that may be richest read but like a cloud as likest may be told that her broad spreading wings did wide unfold whose skirts were bordered with bright sunny beams glistering like gold among the plights enrolled and here and there shooting forth silver streams amongst which crept little angels through the glittering gleams seemed those little angels did uphold the cloth of state and on their purpled wings did bear the pendants through their nimblesse bold beside a thousand more of such as sings hymns to high god and carols heavenly things encompassed the throne on which she sat she angel-like the heir of ancient kings and mighty conquerors in royal state whilst kings and caesars at her feet did them prostrate thus she did fit in sovereign majesty holding a sceptre in her royal hand the sacred pledge of peace and clemency with which high god had blessed her happy land maugre so many foes which did withstand but at her feet her sword was likewise laid whose long rest rusted the bright steely brand yet when as foes inforced or friends sought aid she could it sternly draw that all the world dismayed and round about before her feet there sat a bevy of fair virgins clad in white that goodly seemed adorn her royal state all lovely daughters of high ioue that hight litae by him begotten in loves delight upon the righteous themis those they say upon ioues judgement

goodly temperance in garments clean and sacred reverence born of heavenly strain thus did she fit in royal rich estate admired of many honoured of all whilst underneath her feet there as she sat and huge great lion lay that mote appall and hardy courage like captived thrall with a strong iron chain and collar bound that once he could not move nor quitch at all yet did he murmur with rebellions found and softly royne when salvage choler gan redound so sitting high in dreaded sovereignty those two strange knights were to her presence brought who bowing low before her majesty did to her mild obeisance as they ought and meekest boon that they imagine might to whom she eke inclining her withal as a fair stoop of her high soaring thought a cheerful countenance on them let fallen yet tempered with some majesty imperial as the bright sun what time his fiery teem towards the western brim begins to draw begins to abate the brightness of his beam and fervour of his flames somewhat adaw so did this mighty lady when she saw those two strange knights such homage to her make bore somewhat of that majesty and awe that whilom wont to do so many quake and with more mild aspect those two to entertake now at that instant as occasion fell when these two stranger knights arrived in place she was about affairs of common well dealing of justice with indifferent grace and hearing pleasant of people mean and base amongst which as then there was for to be herd the trial of a great and weighty case which on both sides was then debating hard but at the sighed of these those were a while debarred but after all her princely entertain to hearing of that former cause in hand her self eftsoons she gan convert again which that those knights likewise mote understand and witness forth aright in foreign land taking them up unto her stately throne where they mote hear the matter thoroughly scanned on either part she placed th'one on th'one the other on the other side and near them none then was there brought as prisoner to the bar a lady of great countenance and place but that she it with foul abuse did mar yet did appear rare beauty in her face but blotted with condition vile and base that all her other honour did obscure and titles of nobility deface yet in that wretched semblant she did sure the peoples great compassion unto her allure then up arose a person of deep reach and rare insight hard matters to reveal that well could charm his tongue & time his speech to all assays his name was called zeal he gan that lady strongly to appeal of many heinous crimes by her enured and with sharp reasons rang her such a peel that those whom she to pity had allured he now abhor and loath her person had procured first gan he tell how this that seemed so fair and royally arrayed

questioned be aright but for vild treasons and outrageous shame which she against the dreaded mercilla oft did frame for she whilom as you mote yet right well remember had her counsels false conspired with faithless blandamour and paridell both two her paramours both by her hired and both with hope of shadows vain inspired and with them practised how for to deprive mercilla of her crown by her

climbs but false duessa now untitled queen was brought to her sad doom as here was to be seen strongly did zeal her heinous fact enforce and many other crimes of foul defame against her brought to banish all remorse and aggravate the horror of her blame and with him to make part against her came many graven persons that against her pleaded first was a sage old sire that had to name the kingdoms care with a white silver head that many high regards and reasons gainst her read then gan authority her to appose with peremptory pour that made all mute and then the law of nations gainst her rose and reasons brought that no man could refute next gan religion gainst her to impute high gods behest and pour of holy laws then gan the peoples cry and commons suit importune care of their own public cause and lastly justice charged her with breach of laws but then for her on the contrary part rose many advocates for her to plead first there came pity with full tender heart and with her joined regard of womanhead and then came danger threatening hidden dread and high alliance unto foreign pour then came nobility of birth that bred great ruth through her misfortunes tragic stour and lastly grief did plead & many tears forth pour with the near touch whereof in tender heart the briton prince was soar empassionate and wox inclined much unto her part through the sad terror of so dreadful fate and wretched ruin of so high estate that for great ruth his courage gan relent which when as zeal perceived to abate he gan his earnest fervour to augment and many fearful objects to them to present he gan efforce the evidence anew and new accusements to produce in place he brought forth that old hag of hellish hew the cursed ate brought her face to face who privy was and party in the case she glad of spoil and ruinous decay did her appeach and to her more disgrace the plot of all her practice did display and all her trains and all her treasons forth did lay then brought he forth with grisly grim aspect abhorred murder who with bloody knife yet dropping fresh in hand did her detect and there with guilty bloodshed charged rife then brought he forth sedition breeding strife in troublous wits and mutinous uproar then brought he forth incontinence of life even foul adultery her face before and lewd impiety that her accused soar all which when as the prince had herd and seen his former fancies ruth he gan repent and from her party eftsoons was drawn clean but artegall with constant firm intent for zeal of justice was against her bent so was she guilty deemed of them all then zeal began to urge her punishment and to their queen for judgement loudly call unto mercilla mild for justice gainst the thrall but she whose princely breast was touched never with piteous ruth of her so wretched plighted though plain she saw by all that she did hear that she of death was guilty found by right yet would not let just vengeance on her light but rather let in stead thereof to fallen few purling drops from her fair lamps of light the which she covering with her purple pall would have the passion hid and up arose withal cant. x. prince arthur takes the enterprise for belgee

blasted more happy mother would her surely ween then famous niobe before she tasted latonaes children's wrath that all her issue wasted but this fell tyrant through his tortious pour had left her now but fiue of all that brood for twelue of them he did by times devour and to his idols sacrifice their blood whilst he of none was stopped nor withstood for soothly he was one of matchless might of horrible aspect and dreadful mood and had three bodies in one waste empight and arms and legs of three to succour him in fight and sooth they say that he was born and bred of giants raze the son of geryon he that whilom in spaine so soar was dreaded for his huge pour and great oppression which brought that land to his subjection through his three bodies pour in one combined and eke all strangers in that region arriving to his kine for food assigned the fairest kine alive but of the fiercest kind for they were all they say of purple hew kept by a cowherd hight eurytion a cruel carl the which all strangers slew ne day nor night did sleep t'attend them on but walked about them ever and anon with his two headed dog that orthrus hight orthrus begotten by great typhaon and foul echidna in the

he his sire did quell and came to this where belge then did dwell and flourish in all wealth and happiness being then new made widow as befell after her noble husbands late decease which gave beginning to her woe and wretchedness then this bold tyrant of her widowed taking advantage and her yet fresh woes himself and service to her offered her to defend against all foreign foes that should their pour against her right oppose whereof she glad now needing strong defence him entertained and did her champion chosen which long he used with careful diligence the better to confirm her fearless confidence by means whereof she did at last commit all to his hands and gave him sovereign pour to do what ever he thought good or fit which having god he gan forth from that hour to stir up strife and many a tragic stour giving her dearest children one by one unto a dreadful monster to devour and setting up and idol of his own the image of his monstrous parent geryone so tyrannizing and oppressing all the woeful widow had no means now left but unto gracious great mercilla call for aid against that cruel tyrants theft ere all her children he from her had reft therefore these two her eldest sons she sent to seek for succour of this ladies gift to whom their suit they humbly did present in hearing of full many knights and ladies gent among the which then fortuned to be the noble briton prince with his brave pear who when he none of all those knights did see hastily bent that enterprise to hear nor undertake the same for cowherd fear he stepped forth with courage bold and

riches rare as tokens of her thankful mind beseen and leaving artegall to his own care upon his voyage forth he gan to fare with those two gentle youths which him did guide and all his way before him still prepare ne after him did artigall abide but on his first adventure forward forth did ride it was not long till that the prince arrived within the land where dwelled that lady sad whereof that tyrant had her now deprived and into moors and marshes banished had out of the pleasant soil and cities glad in which she wont to harbour happily but now his cruelty so soar she dread that to those fens for fastness she did fly and there her self did hide from his hard tyranny there he her found in sorrow and dismay all solitary without living wight for all her other children through affray had hid themselves or taken further flight and eke her self through sudden strange affright when one in arms she saw began to fly but when her own two sons she had in sighed she gan take heart and look up joyfully for well she wist this knight came succour to supply and running unto them with greedy joys fell straight about their necks as they did kneel and bursting forth in tears ah my sweet boys said she yet now i gin new life to feel and feeble spirits that gan faint and reel now rise again at this your joyous sighed already seems that fortune's headlong wheel begins to turn and sun to shine more

buildings sunny sheen shut up her haven marred her merchants trade robbed her people that full rich had been and in her neck a castle huge had made the which did her command without needing persuade that castle was the strength of all that state until that state by strength was pulled down and that same city so now ruinate had be the key of all that kingdoms crown both goodly castle and both goodly town till that th'offended heavens list to lower upon their bliss and baleful fortune frown when those gainst states and kingdoms do conjure who then can think their headlong ruin to recure but he had brought it now in servile bound and made it bear the yoke of inquisition striving long time in vain it to withstand yet glad at last to make most base submission and life enjoy for any composition so now he hath new laws and order new imposed on it with many a hard condition and forced it the honour that is due to god to do unto his idol most untrue to him he hath before this castle green built a fair chapel and and altar framed of costly ivory full rich beseene on which that cursed idol far proclaimed he hath set up and him his god hath nam offering to him in sinful sacrifice the flesh of men to gods own likeness framed and powering forth their blood in brutish wise that any iron eyes to see it would agrise and for more horror and more cruelty under that cursed idols altar stone and hideous monster does in darkness lie whose dreadful shape was never seen of none that lives on earth but unto those alone the which unto him sacrificed be those he devours they say both flesh and bone what else they have is all the tyrants fee so that no whit of them remaining one may see there eke he placed a strong garrison and set a seneschal of dreaded might that by his pour oppressed every one and vanquished all venturous knights in fight to whom he wont show all the shame he might after that them in battle he had won to which when now they gan approach in sighed the lady counseled him the place to shun whereas so many knights had foully be fordone her fearful speeches nought he did regard but riding straight under the castle wall called aloud unto the watchful ward which there did wait willing them forth to call into the field their tyrants seneschal to whom when tidings thereof came he straight calls for his arms and arming him withal eftsoons forth pricked proudly in his might and gan with courage fierce address him to the fight they both encounter in the middle plain and their sharp spears do both together smite amid their shields with so huge might and main that seemed their souls they would have riven quite out of their breasts with furious despite yet could the seneschals no entrance find into the princes shield where it empight so pure the mettle was and well refined but shivered all about and scattered in the wind not so the princes but with restless force into his shield it ready passage found both through his habergeon and eke his corpse which tumbling down upon the senseless ground gave leave unto his ghost from thraldom bound to wander in the grisly shades of night there did the prince him leave in deadly swoon and thence unto the castle marched right to see if entrance there as yet obtain he might but as he nigher drew three knights he spied all armed to point issuing forth a pace which towards him with all their pour did ride and meeting him right in the middle raze did all their spears atonce on him enchase as three great culverings for battery bent and leveled all against one certain place do all atonce their thunders rage forth rend that makes the walls to stagger with astonishment so all atonce they on the prince did thunder who from his saddle swerved nought aside ne to their force gave way that was great wonder but like a bulwark firmly did abide rebutting him which in the midst did ride with so huge rigour that his mortal spear passed through his shield & pierced through either side that down he fell upon his mother deer and poured forth his wretched life in deadly drear whom when his other fellows saw they fled as fast as feet could carry them away and after them the prince as swiftly sped to be avenged of their unknightly play there whilst they entering th'one did th'other stay the hindmost in the gate he overhent and as he pressed in him there did slay his carcase tumbling on the threshold sent his groaning soul unto her place of punishment the other which was entered laboured fast to spar the gate but that same lump of clay whose grudging ghost was thereout fled and passed right in the midst of the threshold lay that it the postern did from closing stay the while the prince hard pressed in between and entrance won straight th'other fled away and ran into the hall where he did ween him self to save but he there slew him at the skreen then all the rest which in that castle were seeing that sad ensample them before durst not abide but fled away for fear and them conveyed out at a postern door long sought the prince but when he found no more t'oppose against his pour he forth issued unto that lady where he her had lore and her gan cheer with what she there had viewed and what she had not seen within unto her showed who with right humble thanks him goodly greeting for so great prowess as he there had proved much greater then was ever in her weeting with great admirance inwardly was moved and honoured him with all that her behooved thenceforth into that castle he her led with her two sons right deer of her beloved where all that night them selves they cherished and from her baleful mind all care he banished cant. xi prince arthure overcomes the great gerioneo in fight does slay the monster and restore belge unto her right it often falls in course of common life that right long time is overborn of wrong through avarice or pour or guile or strife that weakens her and makes her party strong but justice though her dome she do prolong yet at the last she will her own cause right as by sad belge seems whose wrongs though long she suffered yet at length she did requite and sent redress thereof by this brave briton knight whereof when news was to that tyrant brought how that the lady belge now had found a champion that had with his champion fought and laid his seneschal low on the ground and eke him self did threaten to confound he gan to burn in rage and frieze in fear doubting sad end of principle unsound yet sith he herd but one that did appear he did him self encourage and take better cheer natheless him self he armed all in haste and forth he fared with all his many bad ne stayed step till that he came at last unto the castle which they conquered had there with huge terror to be more ydrad he sternly marched before the castle gate and with bold vaunts and idle threatening bad deliver him his own ere yet too late to which they had no right nor any wrongful state the prince stayed not his answer to devise but opening straight the spar forth to him came full nobly mounted in right warlike wise and asked him if that he were the same who all that wrong unto that woeful dame so long had done and from her native land exiled her that all the world spoke shame he boldly answered him he there did stand that would his doings justify with his own hand with that so furiously at him he flew as if he would have overrun him straight and with his huge great iron axe gan hew so hideously upon his armour bright as he to pieces would have chopped it quite that the bold prince was forced foot to give to his first rage and yield to his despite the whilst at him so dreadfully he driven that seemed a marble rock asunder could have rive thereto a great advantage eke he has through his three double hands thrice multiplied beside the double strength which in them was for still when fit occasion did betide he could his weapon shift from side to side from hand to hand and with such nimblesse sly could wield about that ere it were espied the wicked stroke did wound his enemy behind beside before as he it list apply which uncouth use when as the prince perceived he gan to watch the wielding of his hand lest by such slight he were unwares deceived and ever ere he saw the stroke to land he would it meet and warily withstand one time when he his weapon feigned to shift as he was wont and changed from hand to hand he met him with a counterstroke so swift that quite smit off his arm as he it up did lift therewith all fraught with fury and disdain he brayed aloud for very fell despite and suddenly avenge him self again gan into one assemble all the might of all his hands and heaved them on hight thinking to pay him with that one for all but the sad steel seized not where it was hight upon the child but somewhat short did fallen and lighting on his horses head him quite did mall down straight to ground fell his astonished steed and eke to earth his burden with him bore but he him self full lightly from him freed and gan him self to fight on foot prepare whereof when as the giant was aware he wox right blithe as he had god thereby and laughed so loud that all his teeth wide bore one might have seen enranged disorderly like to a rank of piles that pitched are awry eftsoones again his axe he reached on high ere he were thoroughly buckled to his gear and can let driven at him so dreadfully that had he chanced not his shield to rear ere that huge stroke arrived on him near he had him surely cloven quite in twaine but th'adamantine shield which he did bear so well was tempered that for all his main it would no passage yield unto his purpose vain yet was the stroke so forcibly applied that made him stagger with uncertain sway as if he would have tottered to one side wherewith full wroth he fiercely gan assay that curtsy with like kindness to repay and smote at him with so importune might that two more of his arms did fallen away like fruitless branches which the hatchet's slight hath pruned from the native tree and cropped quite with that all mad and furious he grew like a fell mastiff through enraging heat and cursed and band and blasphemies forth threw against his gods and fire to them did threat and hell unto him self with horror great thenceforth he cared no more which way he struck nor where it light but gan to chafe and sweat and gnashed his teeth and his head at him shook and sternly him beheld with grim and ghastly look nought feared the child his looks ne yet his threats but only waxed now the more aware to save him self from those his furious heats and watch advantage how to work his care the which good fortune to him offered fair for as he in his rage him overstrook he ere he could his weapon back repair his side all bore and naked overtook and with his mortal steel quite through the body struck through all three bodies he him struck atonce that all the three atonce fell on the plain else should he thrice have needed for the nonce them to have stricken and thrice to have slain so now all three one senseless lump remain enwallowed in his own black bloody gore and biting earth for very death's disdain who with a cloud of night him covering boar down to the house of dole his days there to deplore which when the lady from the castle saw where she with her two sons did looking stand she towards him in haste her self did draw to greet him the good fortune of his hand and all the people both of town and land which there stood gazing from the cities wall upon these warriors greedy understand to whither should the victory befall now when they saw it fallen they eke him greeted all but belge with her sons prostrated low before his feet in all that peoples sighed amongst joys mixing some tears amongst well some woe him thus

to release that your victorious arm will not yet cease till you have rooted all the relics out of that vild raze and established my peace what is there else said he left of their rout declare it boldly dame and do not stand in doubt then wot you sir that in this church hereby there stands and idol of great note and name the which this giant reared first on high and of his own vain fancies thought did frame to whom for endless horror of his shame he offered up for daily sacrifice my children and my people burned in flame with all the tortures that he could devise the more aggrate his god with such his bloody guise and underneath this idol there does lie and hideous monster that does it defend and feeds on all the carcases that die in sacrifice unto that cursed fiend whose ugly shape none ever saw nor kenned that ever scaped for of a man they say it has the voice that speeches forth does send even blasphemous words which she does bray out of her poisonous entrails fraught with dire decay which when the prince herd tell his heart gan earn for great desire that monster to assay and prayed the place of her abided to learn which being showed he gan him self straight way thereto address and his bright shield display so to the church he came where it was told the monster underneath the altar lay there he that idol saw of massy gold most richly made but there no monster did behold upon the image with his naked blade three times as in defiance there he struck and the third time out of and hidden shade there forth issued from under th'altars smoke a dreadful fiend with fowl deformed look that stretched it self as it had long lyen still and her long tail and feathers strongly shook that all the temple did with terror fill yet him nought terrified that feared nothing ill and huge great beast it was when it in length was stretched forth that nigh filled all the place and seemed to be of infinite great strength horrible hideous and of hellish raze born of the brooding of echidna base or other like infernal furies kind for of a maid she had the outward face to hide the horror which did lurk behind the better to beguile whom she so found did find thereto the

so also did this monster use like slight to many a one which came unto her school whom she did put to death deceived like a fool she coming forth when as she first beheld the armed prince with shield so blazing bright her ready to assail was greatly quelled and much dismayed with that dismayful sighed that back she would have turned for great affright but he gan her with courage fierce assay that forced her turn again in her despite to save her self lest that he did her slay and sure he had her slain had she not turned her way tho when she saw that she was forced to fight she flew at him like to and hellish fiend and on his shield took hold with all her might as if that it she would in pieces rend or reave out of the hand that did it hend strongly he strove out of her greedy gripe to lose his shield and long while did contend but when he could not quite it with one stripe her lions claws he from her feet away did wipe with that aloud she gan to bray and yell and fowl blasphemous speeches forth did cast and bitter curses horrible to tell that even the temple wherein she was placed did quake to hear and nigh asunder braced tho with her huge long tail she at him struck that made him stagger and stand half aghast with trembling joints as he for terror shook who nought was terrified but greater courage took as when the mast of some well timbered hulk is with the blast of some outrageous storm blown down it shakes the bottom of the bulk and makes her ribs to crack as they were torn whilst still she stands as astonished and forlorn so was he stound with stroke of her huge tail but ere that it she back again had born he with his sword it struck that without fail he jointed it and marred the swinging of her flail then gan she cry much louder then afore that all the people there without it herd and belge self was therewith astonished soar as if the only found thereof she feared but then the fiend her self more fiercely reared upon her wide great wings and strongly flew with all her body at his head and beard that had he not foreseen with heedful view and thrown his shield atween she had him done to rew but as she pressed on him with heavy sway under her womb his fatal sword he thrust and for her entrails made and open way to issue forth the which once being burst like to a great mill dam forth fiercely gushed and poured out of her infernal sink most ugly filth and poison therewith rushed that him nigh choked with the deadly stink such loathly matter were small lust to speak or think then down to ground fell that deformed mass breathing out clouds of sulphur fowl and black in which a puddle of contagion was more loathed then lerna or then stygian lake that any man would nigh awhape make whom when he saw on ground he was full glad and straight went forth his gladness to partake with belge who watched all this while full sad waiting what end would be of that same danger dread whom when she saw so joyously come forth she gan rejoice and show triumphant cheer lauding and praising his renowned worth by all the names that honourable were then in he brought her and her showed there the present of his pains that monsters spoil and eke that idol deemed so costly dear whom he did all to pieces break and foil in filthy dirt and left so in the loathly soil then all the people which beheld that day gan shout aloud that unto heaven it rung and all the damsels of that town in ray came dancing forth and joyous carols song so him they led through all their streets along crowned with girlands of immortal bays and all the vulgar did about them throng to see the man whose everlasting praise they all were bound to all posterities to raise there he with belgae did a while remain making great feast and joyous merriment until he had her settled in her rain with safe assurance and establishment then to his first emprise his mind he lent full loath to belgae and to all the rest of whom yet taking leave thenceforth he went and to his former journey him addressed on which long way he road ne ever day did rest but turn we now to noble artegall who having left mercilla straight way went on his first quest the which him forth did call to weet to work irenaes franchisement and eke grantortoes worthy punishment so forth he fared as his manner was with only talus waiting diligent through many perils and much way did pass till nigh unto the place at length approached he has there as he traveled by the way he met and aged wight wayfaring all alone who through his years long since aside had set the use of arms and battle quite forgone to whom as he approached he knew anon that it was he which whilom did attend on fair irene in her affliction when first to fairy court he saw her weened unto his sovereign queen her suit for to commend whom by his name saluting thus he gan hail good sir sergis truest knight alive well tried in all thy ladies troubles than when her that tyrant did of crown deprive what new occasion does thee hither driven while she alone is left and thou here found or is she thrall or does she not survive to whom he thus she lives sure and found but by that tyrant is in wretched thraldom bound for she presuming on appointed tied in which you promised as you were a knight to meet her at the salvage lands side and then and there for trial of her right with her vnrigteous enemy to fight did thither come where she afraid of nought by guileful treason and by subtle slight surprised was and to grantorto brought who her imprisoned hath and her life often sought and now he hath to her prefixed a day by which if that no champion do appear which will her cause in battailous array against him justify and prove her clear of all those crimes that he gainst her does rear she death shall by those tidings sad did much abash sir artegall to hear and grieved soar that through his fault she had fallen into that tyrants hand and usage bad then thus replied now sure and by my life too much am i too blame for that fair maid that have her drawn to all this troublous strife through promise to afford her timely aid which by default i have not yet defrayed but witness unto me you heavens that knew how clear i am from blame of this upbraid for you into like thraldom me did throw and kept from complishing the faith which i did owe but now aread sir sergis how long space hath he her lent a champion to provide ten days quoth he he granted hath of grace for that he weens well before that tide none can have tidings to assist her side for all the shores which to the sea accost he day and night does ward both far and wide that none can there arrive without and host so her he deems already but a damned ghost now turn again sir artegall then said for if i live till those ten days have end assure your self sir knight she shall have aid though i this dearest life for her do spend so backward he atone with him did weened tho as they road together on their way a rout of people they before them kenned flocking together in confused array as if that there were some tumultuous affray to which as they approached the cause to know they saw a knight in dangerous distress of a rude rout him chasing to and from that sought with lawless pour him to oppress and bring in bondage of their brutishness and far away amid their rakehell bans they spied a lady left all succourless crying and holding up her wretched hands to him for aid who long in vain their rage withstands yet still he strives ne any peril spares to rescue her from their rude violence and like a lion wood among them fares dealing his dreadful blows with large dispense gainst which the pallid death finds no defence but all in vain their numbers are so great that nought may boot to banish them from thence for soon as he their outrage back does beatrice they turn afresh and oft renew their former threat and now they do so sharply him assay that they his shield in pieces battered have and forced him to throw it quite away from dangers dread his doubtful life to save albe that it most safety to him gave and much did magnify his noble name for from the day that he thus did it leave among all knights he blotted was with blame and counted but a recreant knight with endless shame whom when they thus distressed did behold they drew unto his aid but that rude rout them also gan assail with outrage bold and forced them how ever strong and stout they were as well approved in many a doubt back to recoil until that iron man with his huge flail began to lay about from whose stern presence they diffused ran like scattered chaff the which the wind away does fan so when that knight from peril clear was freed he drawing near began to greet them fair and yield great thanks for their so goodly deed in saving him from dangerous despair of those which sought his life for to impair of whom sir artegall gan then inquire the whole occasion of his late misfare and who he was and what those villains were the which with mortal malice him pursued so never to whom he thus my name is burbon hight well known and far renowned heretofore until late mischief did upon me light that all my former praise hath blemished soar and that fair lady which in that uproar you with those caitiff's saw flower-de-luce hight is mine own love though me she have forlore whither withheld from me by wrongful might or with her own good will i cannot read aright but sure to me her faith she first did plighted to be my love and take me for her lord till that a tyrant which grandtorto hight with golden gifts and many a guileful word entice her to him for to accord o who may not with gifts and words be tempted sith which she hath me ever since abhorred and to my foe hath guilefully consented ay me that ever guile in women was invented and now he hath this troop of villains sent by open force to fetch her quite away gainst whom my self i long in vain have bent to rescue her and daily means assay yet rescue her thence by no means i may for they do me with multitude oppress and with unequal might do overlay that oft i driven am to great distress and forced to forgo th'attempt remediless but why have you said artegall forborn your own good shield in dangerous dismay that is the greatest shame and foulest scorn which unto any knight behappen may to lose the badge that should his deeds display to whom sir burbon blushing half for shame that shall i unto you quoth he bewray lest you therefore mote happily me blame and deem it done of will that through enforcement came true is that i at first was dubbed knight by a good knight the knight of the redcrosse who when he gave me arms in field to fight gave me a shield in which he did endoss his deer redeemer's badge upon the boss the same long while i boar and therewithal fought many battles without wound or loss therewith grandtorto self i did appall and made him oftentimes in field before me fallen but for that many did that shield envy and cruel enemies increased more to stint all strife and troublous enmity that bloody scutcheon being battered soar i laid aside and have of late forbore hoping thereby to have my love obtained yet can i not my love have nathemore for she by force is still from me detained and with corruptful bribes is to untruth mistrained to whom thus artegall certes sir knight hard is the case the which you do complain yet not so hard for nought so hard may light that it to such a straight mote you constrain as to abandon that which does contain your honours style that is your warlike shield all peril ought be less and less all pain then loss of fame in disadventurous field die rather then do ought that mote dishonour yield not so quoth he for yet when time does serve my former shield i may resume again to temporize is not from truth to swerve ne for advantage term to entertain when as necessity does it constrain fie on such forgery said artegall under one hood to shadow faces twaine knights ought be true and truth is one in all of all things to dissemble foully may befall yet let me you of courtesy request said burbon to assist me now at need against these peasants which have me oppressed and forced me to so infamous deed that yet my love may from their hands be freed sir artegall albe he erst did wit his wavering mind yet to his aid agreed and buckling him eftsoons unto the fight did set upon those troops withal his pour and might who flocking round about them as a swarm of flies upon a birchen bough does cluster did them assault with terrible alarm and over all the fields themselves did muster with bills and glaives making a dreadful luster that forced at first those knights back to retire as when the wrathful boreas does bluster nought may abide the tempest of his ire both man and beast do fly and succour do inquire but when as overblown was that brunt those knights began a fresh them to assail and all about the fields like squirrels hunt but chiefly talus with his iron flail gainst which no flight nor rescue mote avail made cruel havoc of the baser crew and chased them both over hill and dale the rascal many soon they overthrew but the two knights themselves their captains did subdue at last they came whereas that lady bode whom now her keepers had forsaken quite to save themselves and scattered were abroad her half dismayed they found in doubtful plighted as neither glad nor sorry for their sighed yet wondrous fair she was and richly clad in royal robes and many jewels dight but that those villains through their usage bade them foully rend and shamefully defaced had but burbon straight dismounting from his steed unto her ran with greedy great desire and catching her fast by her ragged weed would have embraced her with heart entire but she backstarting with disdainful ire bade him avant ne would unto his lore allured be for prayer nor for meed whom when those knights so forward and forlore beheld they her rebuked and upbraided soar said artegall what foul disgrace is this to so fair lady as you seem in sighed to blot your beauty that unblemished is with so foul blame as breach of faith once plighted or change of love for any world's delight is ought on earth so precious or deer as praise and honour or is ought so bright and beautiful as glories beams appear whose goodly light then phebus lamp does shine more clear why then will you found dame attempted be unto a strangers love so lightly placed for gifts of gold or any worldly glee to leave the love that you before embraced and let your fame with falsehood be defaced fie on the pelf for which good name is sold and honour with indignity debased dearer is love then life and fame then gold but dearer them them both your faith once plighted hold much was the lady in her gentle mind abashed at his rebuke that bit her near ne ought to answer thereunto did find but hanging down her head with heavy cheer stood long amazed as she amated wear which burbon seeing her again assayed and clasping betwixt his arms her up did rear upon his steed while she no whit gainsaid so boar her quite away nor well nor ill payed natheless the iron man did still pursue that rascal many with unpitied spoil ne ceased not till all their scattered crew into the sea he drove quite from that soil the which they troubled had with great turmoil but artegall seeing his cruel deed commanded him from slaughter to recoil and to his voyage gan again proceed for that the term approaching fast required speed cant. xii artegall does sir burbon aid and blames for changing shield he with the great grantorto fights and slays him in field o sacred hunger of ambitious minds and impotent desire of men to rain whom neither dread of god that devils binds nor laws of men that common weals contain nor bans of nature that wild beasts restrain can keep from outrage and from doing wrong where they may hope a kingdom to obtain no faith so firm no trust can be so strong no love so lasting then that may endure long witness may burbon be whom all the bans which may a knight assure had surely bound until the love of lordship and of lands made him become most faithless and unsound and witness be gerioneo found who for like cause fair belge did oppress and right and wrong most cruelly confound and so be now grantorto who no less then all the rest burst out to all outrageousness gainst whom sir artegall long having since taken in hand exploit being thereto appointed by that mighty faery prince great gloriane that tyrant to fordo through other great adventures hitherto had it forslacked but now time drawing nigh to him assigned her high behest to do to the sea shore he gan his way apply to weet if shipping ready he mote there descry tho when they came to the sea coast they found a ship all ready as good fortune fell to put to sea with whom they did compound to pass them over where them list to tell the wind and weather served them so well that in one day they with the coast did fallen whereas they ready found them to repel great hosts of men in order martial which them forbade to land and footing did forestall but nathemore would they from land refrain but when as nigh unto the shore they drew that foot of man might found the bottom plain talus into the sea did forth issue though darts from shore & stones they at him threw and wading through the waves with steadfast sway maugre the might of all those troops in view did win the shore whence he them chaste away and made to fly like doves whom the eagle does affray the whiles sir artegall with that old knight did forth descend there being none them near and forward marched to a town in sighed by this came tidings to the tyrants ear by those which erst did fly away for fear of their arrival wherewith troubled soar he all his forces straight to him did rear and forth issuing with his scouts afore meant them to have encountered ere they left the shore but ere he marched far he with them met and fiercely charged them with all his force but talus sternly did upon them set and brushed and battered them without remorse that on the ground he left full many a corpse ne any able was him to withstand but he them overthrew both man and horse that they lay scattered over all the land as thick as does the seed after the sower's hand till artegall him seeing so to rage willed him to stay and sign of truce did make to which all harkening did a while assuage their forces fury and their terror slake till he and herald called and to him spoke willing him weened unto the tyrant straight and tell him that not for such slaughters sake he thither came but for to try the right of fair irenaes cause with him in single fight and willed him for to reclaim with speed his scattered people ere they all were slain and time and place convenient to aread in which they two the combat might deraign which message when grantorto herd full fain and glad he was the slaughter so to stay and pointed for the combat betwixt them twayne the morrow next ne gave him longer day so sounded the retreat and drew his folk away that night sir artegall did cause his tent there to be pitched on the open plain for he had given straight commandment that none should dare him once to entertain which none durst break though many would right feign for fair irena whom they loved deer but yet old sergis did so well him pain that from close friends that dared not to appear he all things did purvey which for them needful wear the morrow next that was the dismal day appointed for irenas death before so soon as it did to the world display his cheerful face and light to men restore the heavy maid to whom none tidings boar of artegals arrival her to free looked up with eyes full sad and heart full soar weening her life's last hour then near to be sith no redemption nigh she did nor hear nor see then up she rose and on her self did dight most squalid garments fit for such a day and with dull countenance and with doleful spright she forth was brought in sorrowful dismay for to receive the doom of her decay but coming to the place and finding there sir artegall in battailous array waiting his foe it did her dead heart cheer and new life to her lent in midst of deadly fear like as a tender rose in open plain that with untimely drought nigh withered was and hung the head soon as few drops of rain thereon distil and dew her dainty face begins to look up and with fresh wonted grace dispreads the glory of her leaves gay such was irenas countenance such her case when artegall she saw in that array there waiting for the tyrant till it was far day who came at length with proud presumptuous gate into the field as if he fearless were all armed in a coat of iron plate of great defence to ward the deadly fear and on his head a steel cap he did wear of colour rusty brown but sure and strong and in his hand and huge pole-axe did bear whose steal was iron studded but not long with which he wont to fight to justify his wrong of stature huge and hideous he was like to a giant for his monstrous hight and did in strength most sorts of men surpass ne ever any found his match in might thereto he had great skill in single fight his face was ugly and his countenance stern that could have frayed one with the very sighed and gaped like a gulf when he did girn that whither man or monster one could scarce discern soon as he did within the lists appear with dreadful look he artegall beheld as if he would have daunted him with fear and grinning grisly did against him wielded his deadly weapon which in hand he held but th'elfin swain that oft had seen like fight was with his ghastly countenance nothing quelled but gan him straight to buckle to the fight and cast his shield about to be in ready plighted the trumpets found and they together go with dreadful terror and with fell intent and their huge strokes full dangerously bestow to do most damage where as most they meant but with such force and fury violent the tyrant thundered his thick blows so fast that through the iron walls their way they rend and even to the vital parts they passed ne ought could them endure but all they cleft or braced which cruel outrage when as artegall did well avise thenceforth with wary heed he shunned his strokes where ever they did fallen and way did give unto their graceless speed as when a skilful marriner does reed a storm approaching that does peril threat he will not bide the danger of such dread but strikes his sails and veers his mainsheet and lends unto it leave the empty air to beatrice so did the faery knight himself abear and stooped oft his head from shame to shield no shame to stoop ones head more high to rear and much to gain a little for to yield so stoutest knights done oftentimes infield but still the tyrant sternly at him laid and did his iron axe so nimbly wield that many wounds into his flesh it made and with his burdenous blows him soar did overlade yet when as fit advantage he did spy the while the cursed felon high did rear his cruel hand to smite him mortally under his stroke he to him stepping near right in the flank him struck with deadly drear that the gore blood thence gushing grievously did underneath him like a pond appear and all his armour did with purple die thereat he brayed loud and yelled dreadfully yet the huge stroke which he before intended kept on his course as he did it direct and with such monstrous poise adown descended that seemed nought could him from death protect but he it well did ward with wise respect and betwixt him and the blow his shield did cast which thereon seizing took no great effect but biting deep therein did stick so fast that by no means it back again he forth could wrest long while he tugged and strove to get it out and all his pour applied thereunto that he therewith the knight drew all about natheless for all that ever he could do his axe he could not from his shield undo which artegall perceiving struck no more but losing soon his shield did it forgo and while he cumbered was therewith so soar he gan at him let driven more fiercely then afore so well he him pursued that at the last he stroke him with chrysaor on the head that with the souse thereof full soar aghast he staggered to and from in doubtful stead again while he him saw so ill bested he did him smite with all his might and main that falling on his mother earth he fed whom when he saw prostrated on the plain he lightly reft his head to ease him of his pain which when the people round about him saw they shouted all for joy of his success glad to be quit from that proud tyrants awe which with strong pour did them long time oppress and running all with greedy joyfulness to fair irena at her feet did fallen and her adored with due humbleness as their true liege and princess natural and eke her champions glory sounded over all who straight her leading with meet majesty unto the palace where their kings did rain did her therein establish peaceably and to her kingdoms seat restore again and all such persons as did late maintain that tyrants part with close or open aid he sorely punished with heavy pain that in short space while there with her he stayed not one was left that durst her once have disobeyed during which time that he did there remain his study was true justice how to deal and day and night employed his busy pain how to reform that ragged commonweal and that same iron man which could reveal all hidden crimes through all that realm he sent to search out those that used to rob and steal or did rebel gainst lawful government on whom he did inflict most grievous punishment but ere he could reform it thoroughly he through occasion called was away to faery court that of necessity his course of justice he was forced to stay and talus to revoke from the right way in which he was that realm for to redress but envies cloud still dims virtues ray so having freed irena from distress he took his leave of her there left in heaviness tho as he back returned from that land and there arrived again whence forth he set he had not passed far upon the strand when as two old ill favoured hags he met by the way side being together set two grisly creatures and to that their faces most foul and filthy were their garments yet being all raged and tattered their disgraces did much the more augment and made most ugly cases the one of them that elder did appear with her dull eyes did seem to look askew that her mishape much helped and her foul hear hung lose and loathsomely thereto her hew was wan and lean that all her teeth arow and all her bones might through her cheeks be read her lips were like raw leather pale and blue and as she spoke therewith she slavered yet spoke she seldom but thought more the less she said her hands were foul and dirty never washed in all her life with long nails over reached like puttock's claws with th'one of which she scratched her cursed head although it itched nought the other held a snake with venom fraught on which she fed and gnawed hungrily as if that long she had not eaten ought that round about her jaws one might descry the bloody gore and poison dropping loathsomely her name was envy known well thereby whose nature is to grieve and grudge at all that ever she sees done praiseworthily whose sighed to her is greatest cross may fallen and vexes so that makes her eat her gall for when she wants other thing to eat she feeds on her own maw unnatural and of her own foul entrails makes her meat meat fit for such a monsters monstrous diet and if she happened of any good to hear that had to any happily betid then would she inly fret and grieve and tear her flesh for fellness which she inward hid but if she herd of ill that any did or harm that any had then would she make great cheer like one unto a banquet bid and in another's loss great pleasure take as she had god thereby and gained a great stake the other nothing better was then she agreeing in bad will and cankered kind but in bad manner they did disagree for what so envy good or bad did find she did conceal and murder her own mind but this what ever evil she conceived did spread abroad and throw in open wind yet this in all her words might be perceived that all she sought was men's good name to have bereaved for whatsoever good by any said or done she herd she would straightways invent how to deprave or slanderously upbraid or to misconstrue of a men intent and turn to ill the thing that well was meant therefore she used often to resort to common haunts and companies frequent to hark what any one did good report to blot the same with blame or wrest in wicked sort and if that any ill she herd of any she would it eke and make much worse by telling and take great joy to publish it to many that every matter worse was for her melling her name was hight detraction and her dwelling was near to envy even her neighbour next a wicked hag and envy self excelling in mischief for her self she only vexed but this same both her self and others eke perplexed her face was ugly and her mouth distorted foaming with poison round about her gills in which her cursed tongue full sharp and short appeared like aspis sting that closely kills or cruelly does wound whom so she wills a distaff in her other hand she had upon the which she little spins but spills and feigns to weave false tales and leasings bad to throw among the good which others had dispread these two now had themselves combined in one and linked together gainst sir artegall for whom they waited as his mortal foes how they might make him into mischief fallen for freeing from their snares irena thrall beside unto themselves they got had a monster which the blatant beast men call a dreadful fiend of gods and men ydrad whom they by slights allured and to their purpose lad such were these hags and so unhandsome dressed who when they nigh approaching had espied sir artegall returned from his late quest they both arose and at him loudly cried as it had be two shepherds curs had scried a ravenous wolf among the scattered flocks and envy first as she that first him eyed towards him runs and with rude flaring locks about her ears does beatrice her breast & forehead knocks then from her mouth the gobbet she does take the which whilere she was so greedily devouring even that half-gnawn snake and at him throws it most despitefully the cursed serpent though she hungrily erst chawed thereon yet was not all so dead but that some life remained secretly and as he passed afore withouten dread bit him behind that long the mark was to be read then th'other coming near gan him revile and foully rail with all she could invent saying that he had with unmanly guile and foul abusion both his honour blended and that bright sword the sword of justice lent had stained with reproachful cruelty in guiltless blood of many and innocent as for grandtorto him with treachery and trains having surprised he foully did to die thereto the blatant beast by them set on at him began aloud to bark and bay with bitter rage and fell contention that all the woods and rocks nigh to that way began to quake and tremble with dismay and all the air rebellowed again so dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray and evermore those hags them selves did pain to sharpen him and their own cursed tongue's did strain and still among most bitter words they spoke most shameful most unrighteous most untrue that they the mildest man alive would make forget his patience and yield vengeance due to her that so false slanders at him threw and more to make them pierce & wound more deep she with the sting which in her vile tongue grew did sharpen them and in fresh poison steep you the past on and seemed of them to take no keep but talus hearing her so lewdly rail and speak so ill of him that well deserved would her have chastized with his iron flail if her sir artegall had not preserved and him forbidden who his hest observed so much the more at him still did she scold and stones did cast yet he for nought would swerve from his right course but still the way did hold to fairy court where what him fell shall else be told the sixte booke of the faerie qveene containing the legend of s. calidore or of covrtesie the ways through which my weary steps i guide in this delightful land of fairy are so exceeding spacious and wide and sprinkled with such sweet variety of all that pleasant is to ear or eye that i nigh ravished with rare thoughts delight my tedious travel do forget thereby and when i gin to feel decay of might ti strength to me supplies & cheers my dulled spright such secret comfort and such heavenly pleasures you sacred imps that on parnasso dwell and there the keeping have of learning's treasures which do all worldly riches far excel into the minds of mortal men do well and goodly fury into them infuse guide you my footing and conduct me well in these strange ways where never foot did use ne none can find but who was taught them by the muse reveal to me the sacred nursery of virtue which with you does there remain where it in silver bower does hidden lie from view of men and wicked world's disdain since it at first was by the gods with pain planted in earth being derived at furst from heavenly seeds of bounty sovereign and by them long with careful labour nursed till it to ripeness grew and forth to honour burst among them all grows not a fairer flower then is the bloom of comely courtesy which though it on a lowly stalk do bower yet branches forth in brave nobility and spreads it self through all civility of which though present age do plenteous seem yet being matched with plain antiquity you will them all but feigned shows esteem which carry colours fair that feeble eyes misdeem but in the trial of true courtesy its now so far from that which then it was that it indeed is nought but forgery fashioned to please the eyes of them that pass which see not perfect things but in a glass yet is that glass so gay that it can blind the wisest sighed to think gold that is brass but virtues seat is deep within the mind and not in outward shows but inward thoughts defined but where shall i in all antiquity so fair a pattern find where may be seen the goodly praise of princely courtesy as in your self oh sovereign lady queen in whose pure mind as in a mirror sheen it shows and with her brightness does inflame the eyes of all which thereon fixed been but merits indeed and higher name yet so from low to high uplifted is your name then pardon me most dreaded sovereign that from your self i do this virtue bring and to your self do it return again so from the ocean all rivers spring and tribute back repay as to their king right so from you all goodly virtues well into the rest which round about you ring fair lords and ladies which about you dwell and do adorn your court where courtesies excel cant. i calidore saves from maleffort a damosel used vild does vanquish crudor and does make briana wax more mild of court it seems men courtesy do call for that it there most uses to abound and well beseems that in princes hall that virtue should be plentifully found which of all goodly manners is the ground and root of civil conversation right so in fairy court it did redound where courteous knights and ladies most did wone of all on earth and made a matchless paragon but amongst them all was none more courteous knight then calidore beloved over all in whom it seems that gentleness of spright and manners mild were planted natural to which he adding comely guise withal and gracious speech did steal men's hearts away natheless thereto he was full stout and tall and well approved in battailous affray that him did much renown and far his fame display ne was there knight ne was there lady found in fairy court but him did deer embrace for his fair usage and conditions found the which in all men's liking gained place and with the greatest purchased greatest grace which he could wisely use and well apply to please the best and evil to embase for he loathed leasing and base flattery and loved simple truth and steadfast houesty and now he was in travel on his way upon and hard adventure soar bestead whenas by chance he met upon a day with artegall returning yet half sad from his late conquest which he got had who whenas each of other had a sighed they knew them selves and both their persons read when calidore thus first hail noblest knight of all this day on ground that breathen living spright now tell if please you of the good success which you have had in your late enterprise to whom sir artegall gan to express his whole exploit and valorous emprise in order as it did to him arise now happy man said then sir calidore which have so goodly as you can devise achieved so hard a quest as few before that shall you most renowned make for evermore but where you ended have now i begin to tread and endless trace withouten guide or good direction how to enter in or how to issue forth in ways untried in perils strange in labours long and wide in which although good fortune me befall yet shall it not by none be testified what is that quest quoth then sir artegall that you into such perils presently does call the blatant beast quoth he i do pursue and through the world incessantly do chase till i him overtake or else subdue yet know i not or how or in what place to find him out yet still i forward trace what is that blatant beast then he replied it is a monster bred of hellish raze then answered he which often hath annoyed good knights and ladies true and many else destroyed of cerberus whilom he was begotten and fell chimaera in her darksome den through fowl commixture of his filthy blot where he was fostered long in stygian fen till he to perfect ripeness grew and then into this wicked world he forth was sent to be the plague and scourge of wretched men whom with vile tongue and venomous intent he soar does wound and bite and cruelly torment then since the salvage island i did leave said artegall i such a beast did see the which did seem a thousand tongues to have that all in spite and malice did agree with which he bayed and loudly barked at me as if that he atonce would me devour but i that knew my self from peril free did nought regard his malice nor his pour but he the more his wicked poison forth did pour that surely is that beast said calidore which i pursue of whom i am right glad to hear these tidings which of none afore through all my weary travel i have had yet now some hope your words unto me add now god you speed quoth then sir artegall and keep your body from the danger dread for you have much ado to deal withal so both took goodly leave and parted several sir calidore thence traveled not long when as by chance a comely squire he found that through some more mighty enemies wrong both hand and foot unto a tree was bound who seeing him from far with piteous found of his shrill cries him called to his aid to whom approaching in that painful stound when he him saw for no demands he stayed but first him loosed and afterwards thus to him said unhappy squire what hard mishap thee brought into this bay of peril and disgrace what cruel hand thy wretched thraldom wrought and thee captived in this shameful place to whom he answered thus my hapless case is not occasioned through my misdesert but through misfortune which did me abase unto this shame and my young hope subvert ere that i in her guileful trains was well expert not far from hence upon yond rocky hill hard by a straight there stands a castle strong which does observe a custom lewd and ill and it hath long maintained with mighty wrong for may no knight nor lady pass along that way and yet they needs must pass that way by reason of the straight and rocks among but they that ladies locks do shave away and that knights beard for toll which they for passage pay a shameful use as ever i did hear said calidore and to be overthrown but by what means did they at first it rear and for what cause tell if thou have it known said then that squire the lady which does own this castle is by name briana hight then which a prouder lady lives none she long time hath deer loved a doughty knight and sought to win his love by all the means she might his name is crudor who through high disdain and proud despite of his self pleasing mind refused hath to yield her love again until a mantle she for him do find with beards of knights and locks of ladies lined which to provide she hath this castle dight and therein hath a seneschal assigned called maleffort a man of much might who executes her wicked will with worse despite he this same day as i that way did come with a fair damosel my beloved deer in execution of her lawless doom did set upon us flying both for fear for little boots against him hand to rear me first he took unable to withstand and while he her pursued every where till his return unto this tree he bound ne wot i surely whither her he yet have found thus while they spoke they herd a rueful shriek of one loud crying which they straight way guessed that it was she the which for help did seek tho looking up unto the cry to lest they saw that carl from far with hand unblest hailing that maiden by the yellow hear that all her garments from her snowy breast and from her head her locks he nigh did tear ne would he spare for pity nor refrain for fear which heinous sighed when calidore beheld eftsoons he loosed that squire and so him left with hearts dismay and inward dolour quelled for to pursue that villain which had reft that piteous spoil by so injurious theft whom overtaking loud to him he cried leave faitor quickly that misgotten wove to him that hath it better justified and turn thee soon to him of whom thou art defied who harkening to that voice him self upreared and seeing him so fiercely towards make against him stoutly ran as nought afeard but rather more enraged for those words sake and with stern countenance thus unto him spoke art thou the caitiff that defiest me and for this maid whose party thou dost take wilt give thy beard though it but little be yet shall it not her locks for ransom from me free with that he fiercely at him flew and laid on hideous strokes with most importune might that oft he made him stagger as unstaid and oft recoil to shun his sharp despite but calidore that was well skilled in fight him long forbore and still his spirit spared lying in wait how him he damage might but when he felt him shrink and come to ward he greater grew and gan to driven at him more hard like as a water stream whose swelling source shall driven a mill within strong banks is penned and long restrained of his ready course so soon as passage is unto him lent breaks forth and makes his way more violent such was the fury of sir calidore when once he felt his foeman to relent he fiercely him pursued and pressed soar who as he still decayed so he increased more the heavy burden of whose dreadful might when as the carl no longer could sustain his heart gan faint and straight he took his flight towards the castle where if need constrain his hope of refuge used to remain whom calidore perceiving fast to fly he him pursued and chased through the plain that he for dread of death gan loud to cry unto the ward to open to him hastily they from the wall him seeing so aghast the gate soon opened to receive him in but calidore did follow him so fast that even in the porch he him did win and cleft his head asunder to his chin the carkarsse tumbling down within the door did choke the entrance with a lump of since that it could not be shut whilst calidore did enter in and slew the porter on the flore with that the rest the which the castle kept about him flocked and hard at him did lay but he them all from him full lightly swept as does a steer in heat of summers day with his long tail the bryzes brush away thence passing forth into the hall he came where of the lady self in sad dismay he was met who with uncomely shame gan him salute and fowl upbraid with faulty blame false traitor knight said she no knight at all but scorn of arms that hast with guilty hand murdered my men and slain my seneschal now comest thou to rob my house unmanned and spoil my self that can not thee withstand yet doubt thou not but that some better knight then thou that shall thy treason understand will it avenge and pay thee with thy right and if none do yet shame shall thee with shame requite much was the knight abashed at that word yet answered thus not unto me the shame but to the shameful doer it afford blood is no blemish for it is no blame to punish those that do deserve the same but they that break bans of civility and wicked customs make those do defame both noble arms and gentle courtesy no greater shame to man then inhumanity then do your self for dread of shame forgo this evil manner which you here maintain and do in stead thereof mild curtsy show to all that pass that shall you glory gain more then his love which thus you seek obtain wherewith all full of wrath she thus replied vile recreant know that i do much disdain thy courteous lore that dost my love deride who scorns thy idle scoff and bids thee be defied to take defiance at a ladies word quoth he i hold it no indignity but were he here that would it with his sword abet perhaps he mote it deer aby cowherd quoth she were not that thou wouldst fly ere thou do come he should be soon in place if i do so said he then liberty i leave to you for aye me to disgrace with all those shames that erst you spoke me to deface with that a dwarf she called to her in haste and taking from her hand a ring of gold a privy token which between them passed bade him to fly with all the speed he could to crudor and desire him that he would vouchsafe to rescue her against a knight who through strong pour had now her self in hold having late slain her seneschal in fight and all her people murdered with outrageous might the dwarf his way did hast and went all night but calidore did with her there abide the coming of that so much threatened knight where that discourteous dame with scornful pride and fowl entreaty him indignified that iron heart it hardly could sustain yet he that could his wrath full wisely guide did well endure her womanish disdain and did him self from frail impatience refrain the morrow next before the lamp of light above the earth upreared his flaming head the dwarf which boar that message to her knight brought answer back that ere he tasted bred he would her succour and alive or dead her foe deliver up into her hand therefore he willed her doe away all dread and that of him she mote assured stand he sent to her his basenet as a faithful band thereof full blithe the lady straight became and gan augment her bitterness much more yet no whit more appalled for the same ne ought dismayed was sir calidore but rather did more cheerful seem therefore and having soon his arms about him dight did issue forth to meet his foe afore where long he stayed not when as a knight he spied come pricking on with all his pour and might well weened he straight that he should be the same which took in hand her quarrel to maintain ne stayed to ask if it were he by name but couched his spear and ran at him amain they be met in midst of the plain with so fell fury and dispiteous force that neither could the others stroke sustain but rudely rolled to ground both man and horse neither of other taking pity nor remorse but calidore uprose again full light while yet his foe lay fast in senseless found yet would he not him hurt although he might for shame he weened a sleeping wight to wound but when briana saw that dreary stound there where she stood upon the castle wall she deemed him sure to have be dead on ground and made such piteous mourning therewithal that from the battlements she ready seemed to fallen natheless at length him self he did uprear in lustless wise as if against his will ere he had slept his fill he wakened were and gan to stretch his limbs which feeling ill of his late fallen a while he rested still but when he saw his foe before in view he shook off luskishness and courage chill kindling a fresh gan battle to renew to prove if better foot then horseback would ensue there then began a fearful cruel fray betwixt them two for mastery of might for both were wondrous practic in that play and passing well expert in single fight and both inflamed with furious despite which as it still increased so still increased their cruel strokes and terrible affright ne once for ruth their rigour they released ne once to breath a while their anger's tempest ceased thus long they traced and traversed to and from and tried all ways how each mote entrance make into the life of his malignant foe they hewed their helms and plataeae asunder brake as they had potsherds be for nought mote slake their greedy vengeances but gory blood that at the last like to a purple lake of bloody gore congealed about them stood which from their riven sides forth gushed like a flood at length it chanced that both their hands on high at once did heave with all their pour and might thinking the utmost of their force to try and prove the final fortune of the fight but calidore that was more quick of sighed and nimbler handed then his enemy prevented him before his stroke could light and on the helmet smote him formerly that made him stoop to ground with meek humility and ere he could recover foot again he following that fair advantage fast his stroke redoubled with such might and main that him upon the ground he groveling cast and leaping to him light would have unlaced his helm to make unto his vengeance way who seeing in what danger he was placed cried out ah mercy sir do me not slay but save my life which lot before your foot does lay with that his mortal hand a while he stayed and having somewhat calmed his wrathful heat with goodly patience thus he to him said and is the boast of that proud ladies threat that menaced me from the field to beatrice now brought to this by this now may you learn strangers no more so rudely to entreat but put away proud look and usage stern the which shall nought to you but foul dishonour yearn for nothing is more blameful to a knight that curtsy does as well as arms profess how ever strong and fortunate in fight then the reproach of pride and cruelness in vain he seeks others to suppress who hath not learned him self first to subdue all flesh is frail and full of fickleness subject to fortune's chance still changing new what haps to day to me to morrow may to you who will not mercy unto others show how can he mercy ever hope to have to pay each with his own is right and due yet since you mercy now do need to crave i will it grant your hopeless life to save with these conditions which i will propound first that you better shall your self behave unto all errant knights whereso on ground next that you ladies aid in every stead and stound the wretched man that all this while did dwell in dread of death his hests did gladly hear and promised to perform his precept well and whatsoever else he would require so suffering him to rise he made him swear by his own sword and by the cross thereon to take briana for his loving fere withouten dowry or composition but to release his former foul condition all which accepting and with faithful oath binding himself most firmly to obey he up arose how ever lief or loath and swore to him true fealty for aye then forth he called from sorrowful dismay the sad briana which all this beheld who coming forth yet full of late affray sir calidore upcheered and to her telled all this accord to which he crudor had compelled whereof she now more glad then sorry erst all overcome with infinite affect for his exceeding courtesy that pierced her stubborn heart with inward deep effect before his feet her self she did project and him adoring as her lives deer lord with all due thanks and dutiful respect her self acknowledged bound for that accord by which he had to her both life and love restored so all returning to the castle glad most joyfully she them did entertain where goodly glee and feast to them she made to show her thankful mind and meaning feign by all the means she mote it best explain and after all unto sir calidore she freely gave that castle for his pain and her self bound to him for evermore so wondrously now changed from that she was afore but calidore himself would not retain nor land nor fee for hire of his good deed but gave them straight unto that squire again whom from her seneschal he lately freed and to his damosel as their rightful meed for recompense of all their former wrong there he remained with them right well agreed till of his wounds he waxed hold and strong and then to his first quest he passed forth along cant. ii calidore sees young tristram slay a proud discourteous knight he makes him squire and of him learns his state and present plighted what virtue is so fitting for a knight or for a lady whom a knight should love as courtesy to bear themselves aright to all of each degree as does behoove for whither they be placed high above or low beneath yet ought they well to know their good that none them rightly may reprove of rudeness for not yielding what they owe great skill it is such duties timely to bestow thereto great help dame nature self does lend for some so goodly gracious are by kind that every actium does them much commend and in the eyes of men great liking find which others that have greater skill in mind though they enforce themselves cannot attain for every thing to which one is inclined does best become and greatest grace does gain yet praise likewise deserve good thews inforced with pain that well in courteous calidore appears whose every act and deed that he did say was like enchantment that through both the eyes and both the ears did steal the heart away he now again is on his former way to follow his first quest when as he spied a tall young man from thence not far away fighting on foot as well he him descried against and armed knight that did on horseback ride and them beside a lady fair he saw standing alone on foot in foul array to whom himself he hastily did draw to weet the cause of so uncomely fray and to depart them if so be he may but ere he came in place that youth had killed that armed knight that low on ground he lay which when he saw his heart was inly child with great amazement & his thought with wonder filled him steadfastly he marked and saw to be a goodly youth of amiable grace yet but a slender slip that scarce did see yet seuenteene years but tall and fair of face that sure he deemed him born of noble raze all in a woodman's jacket he was clad of lincoln green belayed with silver lace and on his head and hood with aglets spread and by his side his hunter's horn he hanging had buskin's he wore of costliest cordwain pinked upon gold and paled part per part as then the guise was for each gentle swain in his right hand he held a trembling dart whose fellow he before had sent apart and in his left he held a sharp boar-spear with which he wont to launch the salvage heart of many a lion and of many a bear that first unto his hand in chase did happen near whom calidore a while well having viewed at length bespoke what means this gentle swain why hath thy hand too bold it self imbrued in blood of knight the which by thee is slain by thee no knight which arms impugns plain certes said he loath were i to have broken the law of arms yet break it should again rather then let my self of wight be stroken so long as these two arms were able to be wrought for not i him as this his lady here may witness well did offer first to wrong ne surely thus unarmed i likely were but he me first through pride and puissance strong assailed not knowing what to arms does long perdie great blame then said sir calidore for armed knight a wight unarmed to wrong but then aread thou gentle child wherefore betwixt you two began this strife and stern uproar that shall i sooth said he to you declare i whose unriper years are yet unfit for thing of weight or work of greater care do spend my days and bend my careless wit to salvage chase where i thereon may hit in all this forest and wild woody rain where as this day i was enranging it i chanced to meet this knight who there lies slain together with this lady passing on the plain the knight as you did see on horseback was and this his lady that him ill became on her fair feet by his horse side did pass through thick and thin unfit for any dame yet not content more to increase his shame when so she lagged as she needs mote so he with his spear that was to him great blame would thump her forward and enforce to go weeping to him in vain and making piteous woe which when i saw as they me passed by much was i moved in indignant mind and gan to blame him for such cruelty towards a lady whom with usage kind he rather should have taken up behind wherewith he wroth and full of proud disdain took in foul scorn that i such fault did find and me in lieu thereof reviled again threatening to chastise me as does t'a child pertain which i no less disdaining back returned his scornful taunts unto his teeth again that he straight way with haughty choler burned and with his spear struck me one stroke or twaine which i inforced to bear though to my pain cast to requite and with a slender dart fellow of this i bear thrown not in vain struck him as seems underneath the heart that through the wound his spirit shortly did depart much did sir calidore admire his speech tempered so well but more admired the stroke that through the mails had made so strong a breach into his heart and had so sternly wreaked his wrath on him that first occasion broke yet rested not but further gan inquire of that same lady whither what he spoke were soothly so and that unrighteous ire of her own knight had given him his own due hire of all which when as she could nought deny but cleared that stripling of th'imputed blame said then sir calidore neither will i him charge with guilt but rather do quite claim for what he spoke for you he spoke it dame and what he did he did him self to save against both which that knight wrought knightless shame for knights and all men this by nature have towards all womankind them kindly to behave but sith that he is gone irrevocable please it you lady to us to aread what cause could make him so dishonourable to driven you so on foot unfit to tread and lackey by him gainst all womanhead certes sir knight said she full loath i were to raise a living blame against the dead but since it me concerns my self to clear i will the truth discover as it chanced whilere this day as he and i together road upon our way to which we weren bent we chanced to come foreby a covert glade within a wood whereas a lady gent sat with a knight in joyous jolliment of their frank loves free from all jealous spies fair was the lady sure that mote content and heart not carried with too curious eyes and unto him did show all lovely courtesies whom when my knight did see so lovely fair he inly gan her lover to envy and wish that he part of his spoil might share whereto when as my presence he did spy to be a let he bade me by and by for to alight but when as i was loath my loves own part to leave so suddenly he with strong hand down from his steed me throws and with presumptuous pour against that knight straight gos unarmed all was the knight as then more meet for ladies service and for loves delight then fearing any foeman there to meet whereof he taking odds straight bids him dight himself to yield his love or else to fight whereat the other starting up dismayed yet boldly answered as he rightly might to leave his love he should be ill payed in which he had good right gainst all that it gainsaid yet since he was not presently in plighted her to defend or his to justify he him requested as he was a knight to lend him day his better right to try or stay till he his arms which were thereby might lightly fetch but he was fierce and hot ne time would give nor any terms aby but at him flew and with his spear him smote from which to think to save himself it booted not mean while his lady which this outrage saw whilst they together for the quarry strove into the covert did her self withdraw and closely hid her self within the grove my knight hers soon as seems to danger drove and left soar wounded but when her he missed he wox half mad and in that rape gan rove and range through all the wood where so he wist she hidden was and sought her so long as him list but when as her he by no means could find after long search and chaff he turned back unto the place where me he left behind there gan he me to curse and ban for lack of that fair booty and with bitter wrack to wreak on me the guilt of his own wrong of all which i yet glad to bear the pack strove to appease him and persuaded long but still his passion grew more violent and strong then as it were avenge his wrath on me when forward we should fare he flat refused to take me up as this young man did see upon his steed for no just cause accused but forced to trot on foot and foul misused pounching me with the butt end of his spear in vain complaining to be so abused for he regarded neither plaint nor tear but more inforced my pain the more my plaints to hear so passed we till this young man us met and being moved with pity of my plighted spoke as was meet for ease of my regret whereof befell what now is in your sighed now sure then said sir calidore and right me seems that him befell by his own fault or through support of countenance proud and halt to wrong the weaker oft falls in his own assault then turning back unto that gentle boy which had himself so stoutly well acquit seeing his face so lovely stern and coy and hearing answers of his pregnant wit he praised it much and much admired it that sure he weened him born of noble blood with whom those graces did so goodly fit and when he long had him beholding stood he burst into these words as to him seemed good fair gentle swain and yet as stout as fair that in these woods amongst the nymphs dost won which daily may to thy sweet looks repair as they are wont unto latonaes son after his chase on woody cynthus done well may i certes such and one thee read as by thy worth thou worthily hast won or surely born of some heroic seed that in thy face appears and gracious goodly head but should it not displease thee it to tell unless thou in these woods thy self conceal for love among the woody gods to dwell i would thy self require thee to reveal for deer affection and unfeigned zeal which to thy noble personage i bear and wish thee grow in worship and great weal for since the day that arms i first did rear i never saw in any greater hope appear to whom then thus the noble youth may be sir knight that by discovering my estate harm may arise unweeting unto me natheless sith you so courteous seemed late to you i will not fear it to relate then wot you that i am a briton born son of a king how ever through fate or fortune i my country have forlorn and lost the crown which should my head by right adorn and tristram is my name the only heir of good king meliogras which did rain in cornewale till that he through lives despair untimely died before i did attain ripe years of reason my right to maintain after whose death his brother seeing me and infant weak a kingdom to sustain upon him took the royal high degree and sent me where him list instructed for to be the widow queen my mother which then hight fair emiline conceiving then great fear of my frail safety resting in the might of him that did the kingly sceptre bear whose jealous dread enduring not a pear is wont to cut off all that doubt may breed thought best away me to remove somewhere into some foreign land where as no need of dreaded danger might his doubtful humour feed so taking counsel of a wise man read she was by him advised to send me quite out of the country wherein i was bred the which the fertile lioness is hight into the land of faery where no wight should weet of me nor work me any wrong to whose wise read she harkening sent me straight into this land where i have woned thus long since i was ten years old now grown to stature strong all which my days i have not lewdly spent nor spilled the blossom of my tender years in idleness but as was convenient have trained be with many noble feres in gentle thews and such like seemly s amongst which my most delight hath always been to hunt the salvage chase among my peers of all that ranges in the forest green of which none is to me unknown that ever was seen ne is there hawk which mantles her on perch whither high towering or accosting low but i the measure of her flight do search and all her prey and all her diet know such be our joys which in these forests grow only the use of arms which most i joy and fits most for noble swain to know i have not tasted yet yet passed a boy and being now high time these strong joints to employ therefore good sir sith now occasion fit does fallen whose like hereafter seldom may let me this crave unworthy though of it that you will make me squire without delay that from henceforth in battailous array i may bear arms and learn to use them right the rather since that fortune hath this day given to me the spoil of this dead knight these goodly gilded arms which i have wone in fight all which when well sir calidore had herd him much more now then erst he gan admire for the rare hope which in his years appeared and thus replied fair child the high desire to love of arms which in you does aspire i may not certes without blame deny but rather wish that some more noble hire though none more noble then is chivalry i had you to reward with greater dignity there him he caused to kneel and made to swear faith to his knight and truth to ladies all and never to be recreant for fear of peril or of ought that might befall so he him dubbed and his squire did call full glad and joyous then young tristram grew like as a flower whose silken leaves small long shut up in the bud from heavens view at length breaks forth and broad displays his smiling hew thus when they long had treated to and from and calidore betook him to depart child tristram prayed that he with him might go on his adventure vowing not to start but wait on him in every place and part whereat sir calidore did much delight and greatly joyed at his so noble heart in hope he sure would prove a doughty knight yet for the time this answer he to him behight glad would i surely be thou courteous squire to have thy presence in my present quest that mote thy kindled courage set on fire and flame forth honour in thy noble breast but i am bound by vow which i professed to my dread sovereign when i it assayed that in achievement of her high behest i should no creature join unto mine aid for thy i may not grant that you so greatly prayed but since this lady is all desolate and needs safeguard now upon her way you may do well in this her needful state to succour her from danger of dismay that thankful guerdon may to you repay the noble imp of such new service fain it gladly did accept as he did say so taking courteous leave they parted twayne and calidore forth passed to his former pain but tristram then despoiling that dead knight of all those goodly implements of praise long fed his greedy eyes with the fair sighed of the bright mettle shining like sun rays handling and turning them a thousand ways and after having them upon him dight he took that lady and her up did raise upon the steed of her own late dead knight so with her marched forth as she did him behight there to their fortune leave we them awhile and turn we back to good sir calidore who ere he thence had traveled many a mile came to the place whereas you herd afore this knight whom tristram slew had wounded soar another knight in his despiteous pride there he that knight found lying on the flore with many wounds full perilous and wide that all his garments and the grass in vermeil died and there beside him sat upon the ground his woeful lady piteously complaining with loud laments that most unlucky stound and her sad self with careful hand constraining to wipe his wounds and ease their bitter paining which sorry sighed when calidore did view with heavy eyes from tears uneath refraining his mighty heart their mournful case can rew and for their better comfort to them nigher drew then speaking to the lady thus he said you doleful dame let not your grief impeach to tell what cruel hand hath thus arrayed this knight unarmed with so unknightly breach of arms that if i yet him nigh may reach i may avenge him of so foul despite the lady hearing his so courteous speech gan rear her eyes as to the cheerful light and from her sorry heart few heavy words forth sighed in which she showed how that discourteous knight whom tristram slew them in that shadow found joying together in unblamed delight and him unarmed as now he lay on ground charged with his spear and mortally did wound withouten cause but only her to reave from him to whom she was for ever bound yet when she fled into that covert grieve he her not finding both them thus nigh dead did leave when calidore this rueful story had well understood he gan of her demand what manner wight he was and how clad which had this outrage wrought with wicked hand she then like as she best could understand him thus described to be of stature large clad all in gilded arms with azure band quartered athwart and bearing in his targe a lady on rough waves rowed in a summer barge then gan sir calidore to guess straight way by many signs which she described had that this was he whom tristram erst did slay and to her said dame be no longer sad for he that hath your knight so ill bestead is now him self in much more wretched plighted these eyes him saw upon the cold earth spread the meed of his desert for that despite which to your self he wrought & to your loved knight therefore fair lady lay aside this grief which you have gathered to your gentle heart for that displeasure and think what relief were best devise for this your lovers smart and how you may him hence and to what part convey to be recured she thanked him deer both for that news he did to her impart and for the courteous care which he did bear both to her love and to her self in that sad drear yet could she not devise by any wit how thence she might convey him to some place for him to trouble she it thought unfit that was a stranger to her wretched case and him to bear she thought it thing too base which when as he perceived he thus bespoke fair lady let it not you seem disgrace to bear this burden on your dainty back my self will bear a part coportion of your pack so off he did his shield and downward laid upon the ground like to and hollow bear and powering balm which he had long purveyed into his wounds him up thereon did rear and betwixt them both with parted pains did bear betwixt life and death not knowing what was done thence they him carried to a castle near in which a worthy ancient knight did won where what ensued shall in next canto be begun cant. iii calidore brings priscilla home pursues the blatant beast saves serena whilst calepine by turpine is oppressed true is that whilom that good poet said the gentle mind by gentle deeds is known for a man by nothing is so well bewrayed as by his manners in which plain is shown of what degree and what raze he is grown for seldom seen a trotting stallion get and ambling colt that is his proper own so seldom seen that one in baseness set does noble courage show with courteous manners met but evermore contrary hath be tried that gentle blood will gentle manners breed as well may be in calidore descried by late ensample of that courteous deed done to that wounded knight in his great need whom on his back he boar till he him brought unto the castle where they had decreed there of the knight the which that castle ought to make abided that night he greatly was besought he was to weet a man of full ripe years that in his youth had been of much might and born great sway in arms among his pears but now weak age had dimmed his candle light yet was he courteous still to every wight and loved all that did to arms incline and was the father of that wounded knight whom calidore thus carried on his chine and aldus was his name and his sons aladine who when he saw his son so ill bedight with bleeding wounds brought home upon a bear by a fair lady and a stranger knight was inly touched with compassion deer and deer affection of so doleful drear that he these words burst forth ah sorry boy is this the hope that to my hoary hear thou brings aye me is this the timely joy which i expected long now turned to sad annoy such is the weakness of all mortal hope so tickle is the state of earthly things that ere they come unto their aimed scope they fallen too short of our frail reckonings and bring us bale and bitter sorrowings in stead of comfort which we should embrace this is the state of keasars and of kings let none therefore that is in meaner place too greatly grieve at any his unlucky case so well and wisely did that good old knight temper his grief and turned it to cheer to cheer his guests whom he had stayed that night and make their welcome to them well appear that to sir calidore was easy gear but that fair lady would be cheered for nought but sighed and sorrowed for her lover deer and inly did afflict her pensive thought with thinking to what case her name should now be brought for she was daughter to a noble lord which dwelled thereby who sought her to affy to a great peer but she did disaccord ne could her liking to his love apply but loved this fresh young knight who dwelled her nigh the lusty aladine though meaner born and of less livelihood and hability yet full of valour the which did adorn his meanness much & make her th'others riches scorn so having both found fit occasion they met together in that luckless glade where that proud knight in his presumption the gentle aladine did erst invade being unarmed and set in secret shade whereof she now bethinking gan advise how great a hazard she at erst had made of her good fame and further gan devise how she the blame might salve with coloured disguise but calidore with all good courtesy feigned her to frolic and to put away the pensive fit of her melancholy and that old knight by all means did assay to make them both as merry as he may so they the evening past till time of rest when calidore in seemly good array unto his bower was brought and there undressed did sleep all night through weary travel of his quest but fair priscilla so that lady hight would to no bed nor take no kindly sleep but by her wounded love did watch all night and all the night for bitter anguish weep and with her tears his wounds did wash and steep so well she washed them and so well she watched him that of the deadly swoon in which full deep he drenched was she at the length dispatched him and drove away the stound which mortally attached him the morrow next when day gan to uplook he also gan uplook with dreary eye like one that out of deadly dream awoke where when he saw his fair priscilla by he deeply sighed and groaned inwardly to think of this ill state in which she stood to which she for his sake had weetingly now brought her self and blamed her noble blood for first next after life he tendered her good which she perceiving did with plenteous tears his care more then her own compassionate forgetful of her own to mind his fears so both conspiring gan to intimate each others grief with zeal affectionate and betwixt them twaine with equal care to cast how to save hold her hazarded estate for which the only help now left them last seemed to be calidore all other helps were passed him they did deem as sure to them he seemed a courteous knight and full of faithful trust therefore to him their cause they best esteemed whole to commit and to his dealing just early so soon as titans beams forth burst through the thick clouds in which they steeped lay all night in darkness dulled with iron rust calidore rising up as fresh as day gan freshly him address unto his former way but first him seemed fit that wounded knight to visit after this nights perilous pass and to salute him if he were in plighted and eke that lady his fair lovely lass there he him found much better then he was and moved speech to him of things of course the anguish of his pain to overpass amongst which he namely did to him discourse of former days mishap his sorrows wicked source of which occasion aldine taking hold gan break to him the fortune's of his love and all his disadventures to unfold that calidore it dearly deep did move in th'end his kindly courtesy to prove he him by all the bans of love besought and as it mote a faithful friend behoove to safeconduct his love and not for ought to leave till to her father's house he had her brought sir calidore his faith thereto did plighted it to perform so after little stay that she her self had to the journey dight he passed forth with her in fair array fearless who ought did think or ought did say sith his own thought he knew most clear from wite so as they passed together on their way he can devise this counter-cast of slight to give fair colour to that ladies cause in sighed straight to the carcase of that knight he went the cause of all this evil who was slain the day before by just avengement of noble tristram where it did remain there he the neck thereof did cut in twaine and took with him the head the sign of shame so forth he passed through that days pain till to that ladies father's house he came most pensive man through fear what of his child became there he arriving boldly did present the fearful lady to her father deer most perfect pure and guiltless innocent of blame as he did on his knighthood swear since first he saw her and did free from fear of a discourteous knight who her had reft and by outrageous force away did bear witness thereof he showed his head there left and wretched life forlorn for vengement of his theft most joyful man her sire was her to see and hear th'aduenture of her late mischance and thousand thanks to calidore for fee of his large pains in her deliverance did yield ne less the lady did advance thus having her restored trustily as he had vowed some small continuance he there did make and then most carefully unto his first exploit he did him self apply so as he was pursuing of his quest he chanced to come whereas a jolly knight in covert shade him self did safely rest to solace with his lady in delight his warlike arms he had from him undight for that him self he thought from danger free and far from envious eyes that mote him spite and eke the lady was full fair to see and courteous withal becoming her degree to whom sir calidore approaching nigh ere they were well aware of living wight them much abashed but more him self thereby that he so rudely did upon them light and troubled had their quiet loves delight yet since it was his fortune not his fault him self thereof he laboured to acquit and pardon craved for his so rash default that he gainst courtesy so foully did default with which his gentle words and goodly wit he soon allayed that knights conceived displeasure that he besought him down by him to fit that they mote treat of things abroad at leisure and of adventures which had in his measure of so long ways to him befallen late so down he sat and with delightful pleasure his long adventures gan to him relate which he endured had through dangerous debate of which whilst they discoursed both together the fair serena so his lady hight allured with mildness of the gentle weather and pleasance of the place the which was dight with diverse flowers distinct with rare delight wandered about the fields as liking led her wavering lust after her wandering sighed to make a garland to adorn her head without suspect of ill or dangers hidden dreaded all suddenly out of the forest never the blatant beast forth rushing unawares caught her thus loosely wandering here and there and in his wide great mouth away her bore crying aloud in vain to show her sad misfare unto the knights and calling oft for aid who with the horror of her hapless care hastily starting up like men dismayed ran after fast to rescue the distressed maid the beast with their pursuit incited more into the wood was bearing her apace for to have spoiled her when calidore who was more light of foot and swift in chase him overtook in midst of his raze and fiercely charging him with all his might forced to forgo his prey there in the place and to betake him self to fearful flight for he durst not abide with calidore to fight who natheless when he the lady saw there left on ground though in full evil plighted yet knowing that her knight now near did draw stayed not to succour her in that affright but followed fast the monster in his flight through woods and hills he followed him so fast that he nould let him breath nor gather spright but forced him gape and gasp with dread aghast as if his lungs and lights were nigh a sunder braced and now by this sir calepine so hight came to the place where he his lady found in dolorous dismay and deadly plighted all in gore blood there tumbled on the ground having both sides through gripped with grisly wound his weapons soon from him he threw away and stooping down to her in dreary swoon upreared her from the ground whereon she lay and in his tender arms her forced up to stay so well he did his busy pains apply that the faint sprite he did revoke again to her frail mansion of mortality then up he took her betwixt his arms twaine and setting on his steed her did sustain with careful hands softing foot her beside till to some place of rest they mote attain where she in safe assurance mote abide till she recured were of those her wounds wide now when as phoebus with his fiery wain unto his inn began to draw apace though wexing weary of that toilsome pain in travelling on foot so long a space not wont on foot with heavy arms to trace down in a dale forby a rivers side he chanced to spy a fair and stately place to which he meant his weary steps to guide in hope there for his love some succour to provide but coming to the rivers side he found that hardly passable on foot it was therefore there still he stood as in a stound ne wist which way he through the ford mote pass thus whilst he was in this distressed case devising what to do he nigh espied and armed knight approaching to the place with a fair lady linked by his side the which themselves prepared through the ford to ride whom calepine saluting as became besought of courtesy in that his need for safe conducting of his sickly dame through that same perilous ford with better heed to take him up behind upon his steed to whom that other did this taunt return perdy thou peasant knight mightest rightly reed me then to be full base and evil born if i would bear behind a burden of such scorn but as thou hast thy steed forlorn with shame so fare on foot till thou another gain and let thy lady likewise do the same or bear her on thy back with pleasing pain and prove thy manhood on the billows vain with which rude speech his lady much displeased did him reprove yet could him not restrain and would on her own palfrey him have eased for pity of his dame whom she saw so diseased sir calepine her thanked yet inly wroth against her knight her gentleness refused and carelessly into the river goes as in despite to be so fowl abused of a rude churl whom often he accused of fowl discourtesy unfit for knight and strongly wading through the waves unused with spear in th'one hand stayed him self upright with th'other stayed his lady up with steady might and all the while that same discourteous knight stood on the further bank beholding him at whose calamity for more despite he laughed and mocked to see him like to swim but when as calepine came to the brim and saw his carriage passed that peril well looking at that same carl with countenance grim his heart with vengeance inwardly did swell and forth at last did break in speeches sharp and fell unknightly knight the blemish of that name and blot of all that arms upon them take which is the badge of honour and of fame lo i defy thee and here challenge make that thou for ever do those arms forsake and be for ever held a recreant knight unless thou dare for thy deer ladies sake and for thine own defence on foot alight to justify thy fault gainst me in equal fight the dastard that did hear him self defied seemed not to weigh his threatfully words at all but laughed them out as if his greater pride did scorn the challenge of so base a thrall or had no courage or else had no gall so much the more was calepine offended that him to no revenge he forth could call but both his challenge and him self contemned ne cared as a coward so to be condemned but he nought weighing what he said or did turned his steed about another way and with his lady to the castle rid where was his wone ne did the other stay but after went directly as he may for his sick charge some harbour there to seek where he arriving with the fallen of day drew to the gate and there with prayers meek and mild entreaty lodging did for her beseek but the rude porter that no manners had did shut the gate against him in his face and entrance boldly unto him forbade natheless the knight now in so needy case gan him entreat even with submission base and humbly prayed to let them in that night who to him answered that there was no place of lodging fit for any errant knight unless that with his lord he formerly did fight full loath am i quoth he as now at erst when day is spent and rest us needs most and that this lady both whose sides are pierced with wounds is ready to forgo the ghost ne would i gladly combat with mine host that should to me such courtesy afford unless that i were thereunto inforced but yet aread to me how hight thy lord that does thus strongly ward the castle of the ford his name quoth he if that thou list to learn is hight sir turpine one of much might and manhood rare but terrible and stern in all assays to every errant knight because of one that wrought him fowl despite ill seems said he if he so valiant be that he should be so stern to stranger wight for seldom yet did living creature see that courtesy and manhood ever disagree but go thy ways to him and from me say that here is at his gate and errant knight that houseroom craves yet would be loath assay the proof of battle now in doubtful night or courtesy with rudeness to requite yet if he needs will fight crave leave till morn and tell with all the lamentable plighted in which this lady languishes forlorn that pity craves as he of woman was born the groom went straight way in and to his lord declared the message which that knight did move who sitting with his lady then at board not only did not his demand reprove but both himself reviled and eke his love albe his lady that blandina hight him of ungentle usage did approve and earnestly entreated that they might find favour to be lodged there for that same night yet would he not persuaded be for ought ne from his currish will awhit reclaim which answer when the groom returning brought to calepine his heart did inly flame with wrathful fury for so foul a shame that he could not thereof avenged be but most for pity of his dearest dame whom now in deadly danger he did see yet had no means to comfort nor procure her glee but all in vain for why no remedy he saw the present mischief to redress but utmost end perforce for to aby which that nights fortune would for him address so down he took his lady in distress and laid her underneath a bush to sleep covered with cold and wrapped in wretchedness while he him self all night did nought but weep and wary watch about her for her safeguard keep the morrow next so soon as joyous day did show it self in sunny beams bedight serena full of dolorous dismay betwixt darkness dread and hope of living light upreared her head to see that cheerful sighed then calepine how ever inly wroth and greedy to avenge that vile despite yet for the feeble ladies sake full loath to make there longer stay forth on his journey goes he goes on foot all armed by her side upstaying still her self upon her steed being unable else alone to ride so soar her sides so much her wounds did bleed till that at length in his extremest need he chanced far off and armed knight to spy pursuing him apace with greedy speed whom well he wist to be some enemy that meant to make advantage of his misery wherefore he stayed till that he nearer drew to weet what issue would thereof betide though whenas he approached nigh in view by certain signs he plainly him descried to be the man that with such scornful pride had him abused and shamed yesterday therefore misdoubting lest he should misguide his former malice to some new assay he cast to keep him self so safely as he may by this the other came in place likewise and couching close his spear and all his pour as bent to some malicious enterprise he bade him stand abide the bitter avow of his soar vengeance or to make avow of the lewd words and deeds which he had done with that ran at him as he would devour his life atonce who nought could do but shun the peril of his pride or else be overrun yet he him still pursued from place to place with full intent him cruelly to kill and like a wild goat round about did chase flying the fury of his bloody will but his best succour and refuge was still behind his ladies back who to him cried and called oft with prayers loud and shrill as ever he to lady was affied to spare her knight and rest with reason pacified but he the more thereby enraged was and with more eager fellness him pursued so that at length after long weary chase having by chance a close advantage viewed he over reached him having long eschewed his violence in vain and with his spear struck through his shoulder that the blood ensued in great abundance as a well it were that forth out of and hill fresh gushing did appear yet ceased he not for all that cruel wound but chased him still for all his ladies cry not satisfied till on the fatal ground he saw his life poured forth dispiteously the which was certes in great jeopardy had not a wondrous chance his rescue wrought and saved from his cruel villainy such chances oft exceed all human thought that in another canto shall to end be brought cant. iiii calepine by a salvage man from turpine rescued is and whilst and infant from a bear he saves his love does miss like as a ship with dreadful storm long tossed having spent all her masts and her ground-hold now far from harbour likely to be lost at last some fisher bark does near behold that gives comfort to her courage cold such was the state of this most courteous knight being oppressed by that faitour bold that he remained in most perilous plighted and his sad lady left in pitiful affright till that by fortune passing all foresight a salvage man which in those woods did won drawn with that ladies loud and piteous shright towards the same incessantly did run to understand what there was to be done there he this most discourteous craven found as fiercely yet as when he first begun chasing the gentle calepine around ne sparing him the more for all his grievous wound the salvage man that never till this hour did taste of pity neither gentlesse knew seeing his sharp assault and cruel stour was much immoved at his perils view that even his ruder heart began to rew and feel compassion of his evil plighted against his foe that did him so pursue from whom he meant to free him if he might and him avenge of that so villainous despite yet arms or weapon had he none to fight ne knew the use of warlike instruments save such as sudden rage him lent to smite but naked without needful vestments to clad his corpse with meet habiliments he cared not for dint of sword nor spear no more then for the stroke of straws or bents for from his mother's womb which him did bear he was invulnerable made by magic lere he stayed not advise which way were best his foe assail or how himself to guard but with fierce fury and with force infest upon him ran who being well prepared his first assault full warily did ward and with the push of his sharp-pointed spear full on the breast him struck so strong and hard that forced him back recoil and reel arear yet in his body made no wound nor blood appear with that the wild man more enraged grew like to a tiger that hath missed his prey and with mad mood again upon him flew regarding neither spear that mote him slay nor his fierce steed that mote him much dismay the salvage nation does all dread despise though on his shield he gripple hold did lay and held the same so hard that by no wise he could him force to lose or leave his enterprise long did he wrest and wring it to and from and every way did try but all in vain for he would not his greedy gripe forgo but hailed and pulled with all his might and main that from his steed him nigh he drew again who having now no use of his long spear so nigh at hand nor force his shield to strain both spear and shield as things that needless were ▪ he quite forsook and fled himself away for fear but after him the wild man ran apace and him pursued with importune speed for he was swift as any buck in chase and had he not in his extremest need be helped through the swiftness of his steed he had him overtaken in his flight who ever as he saw him nigh succeed gan cry aloud with horrible affright and shrieked out a thing uncomely for a knight but when the salvage saw his labour vain in following of him that fled so fast he weary wox and back returned again with speed unto the place whereas he last had left that couple never their utmost cast there he that knight full sorely bleeding found and eke the lady fearfully aghast both for the peril of the present stound and also for the sharpness of her rankling wound for though she were right glad so rid to be from that vile lozel which her late offended yet now no less encumbrance she did see and peril by this salvage man pretended gainst whom she saw no means to be defended by reason that her knight was wounded soar therefore her self she wholly recommended to gods sole grace whom she did oft implore to send her succour being of all hope forlore but the wild man contrary to her fear came to her creeping like a fawning hound and by rude tokens made to her appear his deep compassion of her doleful stound kissing his hands and crouching to the ground for other language had he none nor speech but a soft murmur and confused found of senseless words which nature did him teach express his passion which his reason did impeach and coming likewise to the wounded knight when he beheld the streams of purple blood yet flowing fresh as moved with the sighed he made great moan after his salvage mood and running straight into the thickest wood a certain herb from thence unto him brought whose virtue he by use well understood the juice whereof into his wound he wrought and stopped the bleeding straight ere he it staunched thought then taking up that recreants shield and spear which erst he left he signs unto them made with him to weened unto his wonning near to which he easily did them persuade far in the forest by a hollow glade covered with mossy shrubs which spreading broad did underneath them make a gloomy shade there foot of living creature never trodden ne scarce wild beasts durst come there was this wights abided thither he brought these unacquainted guests to whom fair semblance as he could he showed by signs by looks and all his other gests but the bore ground with hoary moss bestrewed must be their bed their pillow was unsowed and the fruits of the forest was their feast for their bad steward neither ploughed nor sowed ne fed on flesh ne ever of wild beast did taste the blood obeying nature's first behest yet howsoever base and mean it were they took it well and thanked god for all which had them freed from that deadly fear and saved from being to that caitiff thrall here they of force as fortune now did fallen compelled were themselves a while to rest glad of that easement though it were but small that having there their wounds awhile redressed they mote the abler be to pass unto the rest during which time that wild man did apply his best endeavour and his daily pain in seeking all the woods both far and nigh for herbs to dress their wounds still seeming feign when ought he did that did their liking gain so as ere long he had that knights wound recured well and made him whole again but that same ladies hurts no herb he found which could redress for it was inwardly unsound now when as calepine was waxed strong upon a day he cast abroad to weened to take the air and hear the thrush's song unarmed as fearing neither foe nor friend and without sword his person to defend there him befell unlooked for before and hard adventure with unhappy end a cruel bear the which and infant boar betwixt his bloody jaws besprinkled all with gore the little babe did loudly scrike and squall and all the woods with piteous plaints did fill as if his cry did mean for help to call to calepine whose ears those shrieks shrill piercing his heart with pities point did thrill that after him he ran with zealous haste to rescue th'infant ere he did him kill whom though he saw now somewhat overpassed yet by the cry he followed and pursued fast well then him chanced his heavy arms to want whose burden mote impeach his needful speed and hinder him from liberty to pant for having long time as his daily weed them wont to wear and weened on foot for need now wanting them he felt himself so light that like and hawk which feeling her self freed from bells and jesses which did let her flight him seemed his feet did fly and in their speed delight so well he sped him that the weary bear ere long he overtook and forced to stay and without weapon him assailing near compelled him soon the spoil adown to lay wherewith the beast enraged to lose his prey upon him turned and with greedy force and fury to be crossed in his way gaping full wide did think without remorse to be avenged on him and to devour his corpse but the bold knight no whit thereat dismayed but catching up in hand a ragged stone which lay thereby so fortune him did aid upon him ran and thrust it all atone into his gaping throat that made him groan and gasp for breath that he nigh choked was being unable to digest that bone ne could it upward come nor downward pass ne could he brook the coldness of the stony mass whom when as he thus cumbered did behold striving in vain that nigh his bowels braced he with him closed and laying mighty hold upon his throat did gripe his gorge so fast that wanting breath him down to ground he cast and then oppressing him with urgent pain ere long inforced to breath his utmost blast gnashing his cruel teeth at him in vain and threatening his sharp claws now wanting pour to strain then took he up betwixt his arms twaine the little babe sweet relics of his prey whom pitying to hear so soar complain from his soft eyes the tears he wiped away and from his face the filth that did it ray and every little limb he searched around and every part that under swath-bands lay lest that the beasts sharp teeth had any wound made in his tender flesh but whole them all he found so having all his bans again uptied he with him thought back to return again but when he looked about on every side to weet which way were best to entertain to bring him to the place where he would feign he could no path nor tract of foot descry ne by inquiry learn nor guess by aim for nought but woods and forests far and nigh that all about did close the compass of his eye much was he then encumbered ne could tell which way to take now west he went a while then north then neither but as fortune fell so up and down he wandered many a mile with weary travel and uncertain toil yet nought the nearer to his journeys end and evermore his lovely little spoil crying for food did greatly him offend so all that day in wandering vainly he did spend at last about the setting of the sun him self out of the forest he did wind and by good fortune the plain champion won where looking all about where he mote find some place of succour to content his mind at length he herd under the forests side a voice that seemed of some woman kind which to her self lamenting loudly cried and oft complained of fate and fortune oft defied to whom approaching when as she perceived a stranger wight in place her plaint she stayed as if she doubted to have be deceived or loath to let her sorrows be bewrayed whom when as calepine saw so dismayed he to her drew and with fair blandishment her cheering up thus gently to her said what be you woeful dame which thus lament and for what cause declare so mote you not repent to whom she thus what need me sir to tell that which your self have erst aread so right a woeful dame you have me termed well so much more woeful as my woeful plighted cannot redressed be by living wight natheless quoth he if need do not you bind do it disclose to ease your grieved spright oftimes it haps that sorrows of the mind find remedy unsought which seeking cannot find then thus began the lamentable dame sith then you needs will know the grief i hoard i am th'vnfortunate matilde by name the wife of bold sir bruin who is lord of all this land late conquered by his sword from a great giant called cormorant whom he did overthrow by yonder ford and in three battles did so deadly daunt that he dare not return for all his daily vaunt so is my lord now seized of all the land as in his fee with peaceable estate and quietly does hold it in his hand ne any dares with him for it debate but to these happy fortune's cruel fate hath joined one evil which does ouerthow all these our joys and all our bliss abate and like in time to further ill to grow and all this land with endless loss to overflow for heavens envying our prosperity have not vouchsafed to grant unto us twaine the gladful blessing of posterity which we might see after our selves remain in heritage of our unhappy pain so that for want of heirs it to defend all is in time like to return again to that foul fiend who daily does attend to leap into the same after our lives end but most my lord is grieved herewithal and makes exceeding moan when he does think that all this land unto his foe shall fallen for which he long in vain did sweat and swink that now the same he greatly does forthink yet was it said there should to him a son be got not begotten which should drink and dry up all the water which does run in the next brook by whom that fiend should be fordone well hoped he then when this was prophesied that from his sides some noble child should rise the which through fame should far be magnified and this proud giant should with brave emprise quite overthrow who now begins to despise the good sir bruin growing far in years who thinks from me his sorrow all does rise lo this my cause of grief to you appears for which i thus do mourn and pour forth ceaseless tears which when he herd he inly touched was with tender ruth for her unworthy grief and when he had devised of her case he gan in mind conceive a fit relief for all her pain if please her make the proof and having cheered her thus said fair dame in evils counsel is the comfort chief which though i be not wise enough to frame yet as i well it mean vouchsafe it without blame if that the cause of this your languishment be lack of children to supply your place low how good fortune does to you present this little babe of sweet and lovely face and spotless spirit in which you may enchase what ever forms you list thereto apply being now soft and fit them to embrace whither you list him train in chivalry or nursle up in lore of learned philosophy and certes it hath oftentimes be seen that of the like whose lineage was unknown more brave and noble knights have raised been as their victorious deeds have often shown being with fame through many nations blown then those which have be dandled in the lap therefore some thought that those brave imps were sown here by the gods and fed with heavenly sap that made them grow so high t'all honourable hap the lady harkening to his senseful speech found nothing that he said unmeet nor geason having oft seen it tried as he did teach therefore inclining to his goodly reason agreeing well both with the place and season she gladly did of that same babe accept as of her own by livery and seisin and having over it a little wept she boar it thence and ever as her own it kept right glad was calepine to be so rid of his young charge whereof he skilled nought ne she less glad for she so wisely did and with her husband under hand so wrought that when that infant unto him she brought she made him think it surely was his own and it in goodly thews so well upbrought that it became a famous knight well known and did right noble deeds the which elsewhere are shown but calepine now being left alone under the greenwood's side in sorry plighted withouten arms or steed to ride upon or house to hide his head from heavens spite albe that dame by all the means she might him oft desired home with her to weened and offered him his courtesy to requite both horse and arms and what so else to lend yet he them all refused though thanked her as a friend and for exceeding grief which inly grew that he his love so luckless now had lost on the cold ground maugre himself he threw for fell despite to be so sorely crossed and there all night himself in anguish tossed vowing that never he in bed again his limbs would rest ne lig in ease embossed till that his ladies sighed he mote attain or understand that she in safety did remain cant. v. the salvage serves matilda well till she prince arthure find who her together with his squire with th'hermit leaves behind o what and easy thing is to descry the gentle blood how ever it bewrapt in sad misfortunes foul deformity and wretched sorrows which have often happened for howsoever it may grow mishap like this wild man being undisciplined that to all virtue it may seem unapt yet will it show some sparks of gentle mind and at the last break forth in his own proper kind that plainly may in this wild man be read who though he were still in this desert wood amongst salvage beasts both rudely born and bred ne ever saw fair guise ne learned good yet showed some token of his gentle blood by gentle usage of that wretched dame for certes he was born of noble blood how ever by hard hap he hither came as you may know when time shall be to tell the same who when as now long time he lacked had the good sir calepine that far was strayed did wax exceeding sorrowful and sad as he of some misfortune were afraid and leaving there this lady all dismayed went forth straightway into the forest wide to seek if he perchance a sleep were laid or what so else were unto him betide he sought him far & near yet him no where he spied tho back returning to that sorry dame he showed semblant of exceeding moan by speaking signs as he them best could frame now wringing both his wretched hands in one now beating his hard head upon a stone that ruth it was to see him so lament by which she well perceiving what was done gan tear her hair and all her garments rend and beatrice her breast and piteously her self torment upon the ground her self she fiercely threw regardless of her wounds yet bleeding rife that with their blood did all the flore embrue as if her breast new launched with murderous knife would straight dislodge the wretched weary life there she long groveling and deep groaning lay as if her vital powers were at strife with stronger death and feared their decay such were this ladies pangs and dolorous assay whom when the salvage saw so soar distressed he reared her up from the bloody ground and sought by all the means that he could best her to recure out of that stony swoon and staunch the bleeding of her dreary wound yet nould she be recomforted for nought ne cease her sorrow and impatient stound but day and night did vex her careful thought and ever more and more her own affliction wrought at length when as no hope of his return she saw now left she cast to leave the place and weened abroad though feeble and forlorn to seek some comfort in that sorry case his steed now strong through rest so long a space well as she could she god and did bedight and being thereon mounted forth did pace withouten guide her to conduct aright or guard her to defend from bold oppressors' might whom when her host saw ready to depart he would not suffer her alone to fare but gan himself address to take her part those warlike arms which calepine whilere had left behind he gan eftsoons prepare and put them all about himself unfit his shield his helmet and his curats bore but without sword upon his thigh to fit sir calepine himself away had hidden it so forth they traveled and uneven pair that mote to all men seem and uncouth sighed a salvage man matched with a lady fair that rather seemed the conquest of his might got by spoil then purchased aright but he did her attend most carefully and faithfully did serve both day and night withouten thought of shame or villainy ne ever showed sign of foul disloyalty upon a day as on their way they went it chanced some furniture about her steed to be disordered by some accident which to redress she did th'assistance need of this her groom which he by signs did reed and straight his cumbrous arms aside did lay upon the ground withouten doubt or dread and in his homely wise began to assay amend what was amiss and put in right array bout which whilst he was busied thus hard lo where a knight together with his squire all armed to point came riding thitherward which seemed by their portance and attire to be two errant knights that did inquire after adventures where they mote them get those were to weet if that you it requre prince arthur and young timias which met by strange occasion that here needs forth be set after that timias had again recured the favour of belphebe as you herd and of her grace did stand again assured to happy bliss he was full high upreared neither of envy nor of change afeard though many foes did him malign therefore and with unjust detraction him did beard yet he himself so well and wisely boar that in her sovereign liking he dwelled evermore but of them all which did his ruin seek three mighty enemies did him most despite three mighty ones and cruel minded eke that him not only sought by open might to overthrow but to supplant by slight the first of them by name was called despetto exceeding all the rest in pour and hight the second not so strong but wise decetto the third nor strong nor wise but spitefullest defetto oftimes their sundry powers they did employ and several deceits but all in vain for neither they by force could him destroy ne yet entrap in treasons subtle train therefore conspiring all together plain they did their counsels now in one compound where singled forces fail conjoined may gain the blatant beast the fittest means they found to work his utter shame and thoroughly him confound upon a day as they the time did wait when he did range the wood for salvage game they sent that blatant beast to be a bait to draw him from his deer beloved dame unwares into the danger of defame for well they wist that squire to be so bold that no one beast in forest wild or tame met him in chase but he it challenge would and pluck the pray oftimes out of their greedy hold the hardy boy as they devised had seeing the ugly monster passing by upon him set of peril nought dreaded ne skilful of the uncouth jeopardy and charged him so fierce and furiously that his great force unable to endure he forced was to turn from him and fly yet ere he fled he with his tooth impure him heedless bit the while he was thereof secure securely he did after him pursue thinking by speed to overtake his flight who through thick woods and brakes & briers him drew to weary him the more and waste his spite so that he now has almost spent his spright till that at length unto a woody glade he came whose covert stopped his further sighed there his three foes shrouded in guileful shade out of their ambush broke and gan him to invade sharply they all atonce did him assail burning with inward rancour and despite and heaped strokes did round about him hail with so huge force that seemed nothing might bear off their blows from piercing through quite yet he them all so warily did ward that none of them in his soft flesh did bite and all the while his back for best safeguard he lent against a tree that backward onset barred like a wild bull that being at a bay is baited of a mastiff and a hound and a cur-dog that do him sharp assay on every side and beatrice about him round but most that cur barking with bitter sound and creeping still behind does him encumber that in his chauffe he digs the trampled ground and threats his horns and bellows like the thunder so did that squire his foes disperse and driven asunder him well behooved so for his three foes sought to encompass him on every side and dangerously did round about enclose but most of all defetto him annoyed creeping behind him still to have destroyed so did decetto eke him circumvent but stout despetto in his greater pride did front him face to face against him bent yet he them all withstood and often made relent till that at length nigh tired with former chase and weary now with careful keeping ward he gan to shrink and somewhat to give place full like ere long to have escaped hard when as unwares he in the forest herd a trampling steed that with his neighing fast did warn his rider be upon his guard with noise whereof the squire now nigh aghast revived was and sad despair away did cast eftsoones he spied a knight approaching nigh who seeing one in so great danger set amongst many foes him self did faster high to rescue him and his weak part abet for pity so to see him overset whom soon as his three enemies did view they fled and fast into the wood did get him booted not to think them to pursue the covert was so thick that did no passage show then turning to that swain him well he knew to be his timias his own true squire whereof exceeding glad he to him drew and him embracing betwixt his arms entire him thus bespoke my lief my life's desire why have you me alone thus long left tell me what world's despite or heavens ire hath you thus long away from me bereft where have you all this while been wandering where be wove with that he sighed deep for inward tyne to whom the squire nought answered again but shedding few soft tears from tender eyes his deer affect with silence did restrain and shut up all his plaint in privy pain there they awhile some gracious speeches spent as to them seemed fit time to entertain after all which up to their steeds they went and forth together road a comely couplement so now they be arrived both in sighed of this wild man whom they full busy found about the sad serena things to dight with those brave armours lying on the ground that seemed the spoil of some right well renowned which when that squire beheld he to them stepped thinking to take them from that hilding hound but he it seeing lightly to him leapt and sternly with strong hand it from his handling kept gnashing his grinded teeth with grisly look and sparkling fire out of his furious eyes him with his fist unwares on th'head he struck that made him down unto the earth incline whence soon upstarting much he gan repine and laying hand upon his wrathful blade thought therewithal forthwith him to have slain who it perceiving hand upon him laid and greedily him gripping his avengement stayed with that aloud the fair serena cried unto the knight them to dispart in twaine who to them stepping did them soon divide and did from further violence restrain albe the wildman hardly would refrain then gan the prince of her for to demand what and from whence she was and by what train she fell into that salvage villains hand and whither free with him she now were or in band to whom she thus i am as now you see the wretchedest dame that live this day on ground who both in mind the which most grieves me and body have received a mortal wound that hath me driven to this dreary stound i was erewhile the love of calepine who whither he alive be to be

poisonous humour which did most infest their rankling wounds & every day them duly dressed for he right well in leaches craft was seen and through the long experience of his days which had in many fortune's tossed been and passed through many perilous assays he knew the diverse went of mortal ways and in the minds of men had great insight which with sage counsel when they went astray he could inform and them reduce aright and all the passion heal which wound the weaker spright for whilom he had be a doughty knight as any one that lived in his days and proved oft in many perilous fight of which he grace and glory won always and in all battles boar away the bays but being now attached with timely age and weary of this world's unquiet ways he took him self unto this hermitage in which he lived alone like careless bird in cage one day as he was searching of their wounds he found that they had festered privily and rankling inward with unruly stounds the inner parts now gan to putrify that quite they seemed passed help of surgery and rather needed to be disciplined with wholesome reed of sad sobriety to rule the stubborn rage of passion blind give salves to every soar but counsel to the mind so taking them apart into his cell he to that point fit speeches gan to frame as he the art of words knew wondrous well and eke could do as well as say the same and thus he to them said fair daughter dame and you fair son which here thus long now lie in piteous languor since you hither came in vain of me you hope for remedy and i likewise in vain do salves to you apply for in your self your only help does lie to heal your selves and must proceed alone from your own will to cure your malady who can him cure that will be cured of none if therefore health you seek observe this one first learn your outward senses to refrain from things that stir up frail affection your eyes your ears your tongue your talk restain from that they most affect and in due terms contain for from those outward senses ill affected the seed of all this evil first does spring which at the first before it had infected mote easy be suppressed with little thing but being grown strong it forth does bring sorrow and anguish and impatient pain in th'inner parts and lastly scattering contagious poison close through every vain it never rests till it have wrought his final bane for that beasts teeth which wounded you tofore are so exceeding venomous and keen made all of rusty iron rankling soar that where they bite it boots not to ween with salve or antidote or other mean it ever to amend ne marvel ought for that same beast was bred of hellish strain and long in darksome stygian den upbrought begotten of foul echidna as in books is taught echidna is a monster direful dreaded whom gods do hate and heavens abhor to see so hideous is her shape so huge her head that even the hellish fiends affrighted be at sighed thereof and from her presence flee yet did her face and former parts profess a fair young maiden full of comely glee but all her hinder parts did plain express a monstrous dragon full of fearful ugliness to her the gods for her so dreadful face in fearful darkness furthest from the sky and from the earth appointed have her place amongst rocks and caves where she enrolled does lie in hideous horror and obscurity wasting the strength of her immortal age there did typhaon with her company cruel typhaon whose tempestuous rage make heavens tremble oft & him with vows assuage of that commixtion they did then beget this hellish dog that hight the blatant beast a wicked monster that his tongue does whet gainst all both good and bad both most and least and pours his poisonous gall forth to infest the noblest wights with notable defame ne ever knight that boar so lofty crest ne ever lady of so honest name but he them spotted with reproach or secret shame in vain therefore it were with medicine to go about to salve such kind of soar that rather needs wise read and discipline then outward salves that may augment it more aye me said then serena sighing soar what hope of help does then for us remain if that no salves may us to health restore but sith we need good counsel said the swain aread good sire some counsel that may us sustain the best said he that i can you advise is to avoid the occasion of the ill for when the cause whence evil does arise removed is effect surceases still abstain from pleasure and restrain your will subdue desire and bridle lose delight use scanted diet and forbear your fill shun secrecy and talk in open sighed so shall you soon repair your present evil plighted thus having said his sickly patients did gladly harken to his graven behest and kept so well his wise commandments that in short space their malady was ceased and eke the biting of that harmful beast was thoroughly healed tho when they did perceive their wounds recured and forces reincreased of that good hermit both they took their leave and went both on their way ne each would other leave but each th'other vowed accompany the lady for that she was much in dreaded now left alone in great extremity the squire for that he courteous was indeed would not her leave alone in her great need so both together traveled till they met with a fair maiden clad in mourning weed upon a mangy jade unmeetly set and a lewd fool her leading through dry and wet but by what means that shame to her befell and how thereof her self she did acquit i must a while forbear to you to tell till that as comes by course i do recite what fortune to the briton prince did lite pursuing that proud knight the which whilere wrought to sir calidore so foul despite and eke his lady though she sickly were so lewdly had abused as you did lately hear the prince according to the former token which fair serene to him delivered had pursued him straight in mind to be wrought of all the vile demean and usage bad with which he had those two so ill bestead ne wight with him on that adventure went but that wild man whom though he oft forbade yet for no bidding nor for being shent would he restrained be from his attendment arriving there as did by chance befall he found the gate wide open and in he road ne stayed till that he came into the hall where soft dismounting like a weary load upon the ground with feeble feet he trodden as he unable were for very need to move one foot but there must make abided the while the salvage man did take his steed and in some stable near did set him up to feed ere long to him a homely groom there came that in rude wise him asked what he was that durst so boldly without let or shame into his lords forbidden hall to pass to whom the prince him feigning to embase mild answer made he was and errant knight the which was fallen into this feeble case through many wounds which lately he in fight received had and prayed to pity his ill plighted but he the more outrageous and bold sternly did bid him quickly thence avant or deer aby for why his lord of old did hate all errant knights which there did haunt ne lodging would to any of them grant and therefore lightly bade him pack away not sparing him with bitter words to taunt and therewithal rude hand on him did lay to thrust him out of door doing his worst assay which when the salvage coming now in place beheld eftsoons he all enraged grew and running straight upon that villain base like a fell lion at him fiercely flew and with his teeth and nails in present view him rudely rend and all to pieces tore so miserably him all helpless slew that with the noise whilst he did loudly roar the people of the house rose forth in great uproar who when on ground they saw their fellow slain and that same knight and salvage standing by upon them two they fell with might and main and on them laid so huge and horribly as if they would have slain them presently but the bold prince defended him so well and their assault withstood so mightily that maugre all their might he did repel and beatrice them back whilst many underneath him fell yet he them still so sharply did pursue that few of them he left alive which fled those evil tidings to their lord to show who hearing how his people badly sped came forth in haste where when as with the dead he saw the ground all strowed and that same knight and salvage with their blood fresh steeming read he wox nigh mad with wrath and fell despite and with reproachful words him thus bespoke on hight art thou he traitor that with treason vile hast slain my men in this unmanly manner and now triumphest in the piteous spoil of these poor folk whose souls with black dishonour and foul defame do deck thy bloody banner the meed whereof shall shortly be thy shame and wretched end which still attends on her with that him self to battle he did frame so did his forty yeomen which there with him came with dreadful force they all did him assail and round about with boisterous strokes oppress that on his shield did rattle like to hail in a great tempest that in such distress he wist not to which side him to address and evermore that craven cowherd knight was at his back with heartless heediness waiting if he unwares him murder might for cowardice does still in villainy delight whereof whenas the prince was well aware he to him turned with furious intent and him against his pour gan to prepare like a fierce bull that being busy bent to fight with many foes about him meant feeling some cur behind his heals to bite turns him about with fell avengement so likewise turned the prince upon the knight and laid at him amain with all his will and might who when he once his dreadful strokes had tasted durst not the fury of his force abide but turned aback and to retire him hasted through the thick press there thinking him to hide but when the prince had once him plainly eyed he foot by foot him followed always ne would him suffer once to shrink aside but joining close huge load at him did lay who flying still did ward and warding fly away but when his foe he still so eager saw unto his heals himself he did betake hoping unto some refuge to withdraw ne would the prince him ever foot forsake where so he went but after him did make he fled from room to room from place to place whilst every joint for dread of death did quake still looking after him that did him chase that made him evermore increase his speedy pace at last he up into the chamber came whereas his love was sitting all alone waiting what tidings of her folk became there did the prince him overtake anon crying in vain to her him to bemoan and with his sword him on the head did smite that to the gound he fell in senseless swoon yet whither thwart or flatly it did light the tempered steel did not into his brainpan bite which when the lady saw with great affright she starting up began to shriek aloud and with her garment covering him from sighed seemed under her protection him to shroud and falling lowly at his feet her bowed upon her knee entreating him for grace and often him besought and prayed and vowed that with the ruth of her so wretched case he stayed his second struck and did his hand abase her weed she then withdrawing did him discover who now come to himself yet would not rise but still did lie as dead and quake and quiver that even the prince his baseness did despise and eke his dame him seeing in such guise gan him recomfort and from ground to rear who rising up at last in ghastly wise like troubled ghost did dreadfully appear as one that had no life him left through former fear whom when the prince so deadly saw dismayed he for such baseness shamefully him shent and with sharp words did bitterly upbraid vile cowherd dog now do i much repent that ever i this life unto thee lent whereof thou caitiff so unworthy art that both thy love for lack of hardiment and eke thy self for want of manly heart and eke all knights hast shamed with this knightless part yet further hast thou heaped shame to shame and crime to crime by this thy cowherd fear for first it was to thee reproachful blame to erect this wicked custom which i hear gainst errant knights and ladies thou dost rear whom when thou mayest thou dost of arms despoil or of their upper garment which they wear yet dost thou not with manhood but with guile maintain this evil use thy foes thereby to foil and lastly in approvance of thy wrong to show such faintness and foul cowardice is greatest shame for oft it falls that strong and valiant knights do rashly enterprise either for fame or else for exercise a wrongful quarrel to maintain by right yet have through prowess and their brave emprise got great worship in this world's sighed for greater force there needs to maintain wrong then right yet since thy life unto this lady fair i given have live in reproach and scorn ne ever arms ne ever knighthood dare hence to profess for shame is to adorn with so brave badges one so basely born but only breath sith that i did forgive so having from his craven body torn those goodly arms he them away did give and only suffered him this wretched life to live there whilst he thus was settling things above atween that lady mild and recreant knight to whom his life he granted for her love he gan bethink him in what perilous plighted he had behind him left that salvage wight among so many foes whom sure he thought by this quite slain in so unequal fight therefore descending back in haste he sought if yet he were alive or to destruction brought there he him found environed about with slaughtered bodies which his hand had slain and laying yet a fresh with courage stout upon the rest that did alive remain whom he likewise right sorely did constrain like scattered sheep to seek for safety after he got had with busy pain some of their weapons which thereby did lie with which he laid about and made them fast to fly whom when the prince so felly saw to rage approaching to him near his hand he stayed and sought by making signs him to assuage who them perceiving straight to him obeyed as to his lord and down his weapons laid as if he long had to his hests be trained thence he him brought away and up conveyed into the chamber where that dame remained with her unworthy knight who ill him entertained whom when the salvage saw from danger free sitting beside his lady there at ease he well remembered that the same was he which lately sought his lord for to displease though all in rage he on him straight did seize as if he would in pieces him have rend and were not that the prince did him appease he had not left one limb of him unrent but straight he held his hand at his commandment thus having all things well in peace ordained the prince himself there all that night did rest where him blandina fairly entertained with all the courteous glee and goodly feast the which for him she could imagine best for well she knew the ways to win good will of every wight that were not too infest and how to please the minds of good and ill through tempering of her words & looks by wondrous skill yet were her words and looks but false and feigned to some hid end to make more easy way or to allure such foundlings whom she trained into her trap unto their own decay thereto when needed she could weep and pray and when her listed she could fawn and flatter now smiling smoothly like to summers day now glooming sadly so to cloak her matter yet were her words but wind & all her tears but water whither such grace were given her by kind as women wont their guileful wits to guide or learned the art to please i do not find this well i wot that she so well applied her pleasing tongue that soon she pacified the wrathful prince & wrought her husbands peace who natheless not therewith satisfied his rancorous despite did not release ne secretly from thought of fell revenge surcease for all that night the whiles the prince did rest in careless couch not weeting what was meant he watched in close await with weapons pressed willing to work his villainous intent on him that had so shamefully him shent yet durst he not for very cowardice effect the same whilst all the night was spent the morrow next the prince did early rise and passed forth to follow his first enterprise cant. vii turpine is baffled his two knights do gain their treasons meed fair mirabellaes punishment for loves disdain decreed like as the gentle heart it self betrays in doing gentle deeds with frank delight even so the baser mind it self displays in cankered malice and revengeful spite for to malign envy use shifting slight be arguments of a vile dunghill mind which what it dare not do by open might to work by wicked treason ways does find by such discourteous deeds discovering his base kind that well appears in this discourteous knight the coward turpine whereof now i treat who notwithstanding that in former fight he of the prince his life received late yet in his mind malicious and ingrate he gan denize to be avenged anew for all that shame which kindled inward hate therefore so soon as he was out of view himself in haste he armed and did him fast pursue well did he tract his steps as he did ride yet would not near approach in dangers eye but kept aloof for dread to be descried until fit time and place he mote espy where he mote work him scathe and villainy at last he met two knights to him unknown the which were armed both agreeably and both combined what ever chance were blown betwixt them to divide and each to make his own to whom false turpine coming courteously to cloak the mischief which he inly meant gan to complain of great discourtesy which a strange knight that near afore him went had done to him and his deer lady shent which if they would afford him aid at need for to avenge in time convenient they should accomplish both a knightly deed and for their pains obtain of him a goodly meed the knights believed that all he said was true and being fresh and full of youthly spright were glad to hear of that adventure new in which they mote make trial of their might which never yet they had approved in fight and eke desirous of the offered meed said then the one of them where is that wight the which hath done to thee this wrongful deed that we may it avenge and punish him with speed he rides said turpine there not far afore with a wild man soft footing by his side that if you list to haste a little more you may him overtake in timely tied eftsoons they pricked forth with forward pride and ere that little while they ridden had the gentle prince not far away they spied riding a softly pace with portance sad devizing of his love more then of danger dread then one of them aloud unto him cried bidding him turn again false traitor knight foul womanwronger for he him defied with that they both at once with equal spite did bend their spears and both with equal might against him ran but th'one did miss his mark and being carried with his force forthright glanced swiftly by like to that heavenly spark which gliding through the air lights all the heavens dark but th'other aiming better did him smite full in the shield with so impetuous pour that all his lance in pieces shivered quite and scattered all about fell on the flower but the stout prince with much more steady stour full on his beaver did him strike so soar that the cold steel through piercing did devour his vital breath and to the ground him boar where still he bathed lay in his own bloody gore as when a cast of falcons make their flight at and herneshaw that lies aloft on wing the whiles they strike at him with heedless might the wary foul his bill does backward wring on which the first whose force her first does bring her self quite through the body does engore and falls down to ground like senseless thing but th'other not so swift as she before fails of her souse and passing by does hurt no more by this the other which was passed by himself recovering was returned to fight where when he saw his fellow lifeless lie he much was daunted with so dismal sighed yet nought abating of his former spite let driven at him with so malicious mind as if he would have passed through him quite but the steelhead no steadfast hold could find but glancing by deceived him of that he designed not so the prince for his well learned spear took surer hold and from his horses back above a lances length him forth did bear and gainst the cold hard earth so soar him strake that all his bones in pieces nigh he brake where seeing him so lie he left his steed and to him leaping vengeance thought to take of him for all his former follies meed with flaming sword in hand his terror more to breed the fearful swain beholding death so nigh cried out aloud for mercy him to save in lieu whereof he would to him descry great treason to him meant his life to reave the prince soon hearkened and his life forgave then thus said he there is a stranger knight the which for promise of great meed us drove to this attempt to wreak his hid despite for that himself thereto did want sufficient might the prince much mused at such villainy and said now sure you well have earned your meed for th'one is dead and th'other soon shall die unless to me thou hither bring with speed the wretch that hired you to this wicked deed he glad of life and willing eke to wreak the guilt on him which did this mischief breed swore by his sword that neither day nor week he would surcease but him where so he were would seek so up he rose and forth straight way he went back to the place where turpine late he lore there he him found in great astonishment to see him so bedight with bloody gore and grisly wounds that him appalled soar yet thus at length he said how now sir knight what means this which here i see before how fortunes this foul uncomely plighted so different from that which erst you seemed in sighed perdie said he in evil hour it fell that ever i for meed did undertake so hard a task as life for hire to fell the which i erst adventured for your sake witness the wounds and this wide bloody lake which you may see yet all about me steam therefore now yield as you did promise make my due reward the which right well i deem i yearned have that life so dearly did redeem but where then is quoth he half wrothfully where is the booty which therefore i bought that cursed caitiff my strong enemy that recreant knight whose hated life i sought and where is eke your friend which half it ought he lies said he upon the cold bore ground slain of that errant knight with whom he fought whom afterwards my self with many a wound did slay again as you may see there in the stound thereof false turpin was full glad and feign and needs with him straight to the place would ride where he himself might see his foeman slain for else his fear could not be satisfied so as they road he saw the way all died with streams of blood which tracting by the trail ere long they came whereas in evil tied that other swain like ashes deadly pale lay in the lap of death rewing his wretched bale much did the craven seem to moan his case that for his sake his deer life had forgone and him bewailing with affection base did counterfeit kind pity where was none for where no courage theres no ruth nor moan thence passing forth not far away he found whereas the prince himself lay all alone loosely displayed upon the grassy ground possessed of sweet sleep that lulled him soft in swoon weary of travel in his former fight he there in shade himself had laid to rest having his arms and warlike things undight fearless of foes that mote his peace molest the whiles his salvage page that wont be pressed was wandered in the wood another way to do some thing that seemed to him best the whiles his lord in silver slumber lay like to the evening star adorned with dewy ray whom when as turpin saw so loosely laid he weened well that he in deed was dead like as that other knight to him had said but when he nigh approached he mote aread plain signs in him of life and livelihood whereat much grieved against that stranger knight that him too light of credence did mislead he would have back retired from that sighed that was to him on earth the deadliest despite but that same knight would not once let him start but plainly gan to him declare the case of all his mischief and late luckless smart how both he and his fellow there in place were vanquished and put to foul disgrace and how that he in lieu of life him lent had vowed unto the victor him to trace and follow through the world where so he went till that he him delivered to his punishment he therewith much abashed and afraid began to tremble every limb and vain and softly whispering him entirely prayed advise him better then by such a train him to betray unto a stranger swain yet rather counseled him contrariwise sith he likewise did wrong by him sustain to join with him and vengeance to devise whilst time did offer means him sleeping to surprise natheless for all his speech the gentle knight would not be tempted to such villainy regarding more his faith which he did plighted all were it to his mortal enemy then to entrap him by false treachery great shame in lieges' blood to be imbrued thus whilst they were debating diversely the salvage forth out of the wood issued back to the place whereas his lord he sleeping viewed there when he saw those two so near him stand he doubted much what mote their meaning be and throwing down his load out of his hand to weet great store of forest fruit which he had for his food late gathered from the tree himself unto his weapon he betook that was and oaken plant which lately he rend by the root which he so sternly shook that like and hazel wand it quivered and quaked whereat the prince awaking when he spied the traitor turpin with that other knight he started up and snatching near his side his trusty sword the servant of his might like a fell lion leapt to him light and his left hand upon his collar laid therewith the cowherd deadened with affright fell flat to ground ne word unto him said but holding up his hands with silence mercy prayed but he so full of indignation was that to his prayer nought he would incline but as he lay upon the humbled grass his foot he set on his vile neck in sign of servile yoke that nobler hearts repine then letting him arise like abject thrall he gan to him object his heinous crime and to revile and rate and recreant call and lastly to despoil of knightly banner all and after all for greater infamy he by the heals him hung upon a tree and baffled so that all which passed by the picture of his punishment might see and by the like ensample warned be how ever they through treason do trespass but turn we now back to that lady free whom late we left riding upon and ass led by a carl and fool which by her side did pass she was a lady of great dignity and lifted up to honourable place famous through all the land of faery though of mean parentage and kindred base yet decked with wondrous gifts of nature's grace that all men did her person much admire and praise the feature of her goodly face the beams whereof did kindle lovely fire in harts of many a knight and many a gentle squire but she thereof grew proud and insolent that none she worthy thought to be her fere but scorned them all that love unto her meant yet was she loved of many a worthy peer unworthy she to be beloved so dear that could not weigh of worthiness aright for beauty is more glorious bright and clear the more it is admired of many a wight and noblest she that served is of noblest knight but this coy damosel thought contrariwise that such proud looks would make her praised more and that the more she did all love despise the more would wretched lovers her adore what cared she who sighed for her soar or who did wail or watch the weary night let them that list their luckless lot deplore she was born free not bound to any wight and so would ever live and love her own delight through such her stubborn stiffness and hard heart many a wretch for want of remedy did languish long in life consuming smart and at the last through dreary dolour die whilst she the lady of her liberty did boast her beauty had such sovereign might that with the only twinkle of her eye she could or save or spill whom she would hight what could the gods do more but do it more aright but lo the gods that mortal follies view did worthily revenge this maidens pride and nought regarding her so goodly hew did laugh at her that many did deride whilst she did weep of no man mercified for on a day when cupid kept his court as he is wont at each saint valentide unto the which all lovers do resort that of their loves success they there may make report it fortuned then that when the rolls were read in which the names of all loves folk were filed that many there were missing which were dead or kept in bans or from their loves exiled or by some other violence despoiled which when as cupid herd he waxed wroth and doubting to be wronged or beguiled he bade his eyes to be unblindfold both that he might see his men and muster them by oath then found he many missing of his crew which wont do suit and service to his might of whom what was becomen no man knew therefore a jury was impaneled straight t'enquire of them whither by force or sleight or their own guilt they were away conveyed to whom foul infamy and fell despite gave evidence that they were all betrayed and murdered cruelly by a rebellious maid fair mirabella was her name whereby of all those crimes she there indited was all which when cupid herd he by and by in great displeasure wild a capias should issue forth attach that scornful lass the warrant straight was made and therewithal a bailiff errant forth in post did pass whom they by name there portamore did call he which does summon lovers to loves judgement hall the damosel was attached and shortly brought unto the bar whereas she was arraigned but she thereto nould plead nor answer ought even for stubborn pride which her restrained so judgement past as is by law ordained in cases like which when at last she saw her stubborn heart which love before disdained gan stoop and falling down with humble awe cried mercy to abate the extremity of law the son of venus who is mild by kind but where he is provoked with peevishness unto her prayers piteously inclined and did the rigour of his doom repress yet not so freely but that natheless he unto her a penance did impose which was that through this world's wide wilderness she wander should in company of those till she had saved so many loves as she did loose so now she had be wandering two whole years throughout the world in this uncomely case wasting her goodly hew in heavy tears and her good days in dolorous disgrace yet had she not in all these two years space saved but two yet in two years before through her dispiteous pride whilst love lacked place she had destroyed two and twenty more aye me how could her love make half amends therefore and now she was upon the weary way when as the gentle squire with fair serene met her in such misseeming foul array the while that mighty man did her demean with all the evil terms and cruel mean that he could make and eke that angry fool which followed her with cursed hands unclean whipping her horse did with his smarting tool oft whip her dainty self and much augment her dole ne ought it mote avail her to entreat the one or th'other better her to use for both so wilful were and obstinate that all her piteous plaint they did refuse and rather did the more her beat and bruise but most the former villain which did led her tireling jade was bent her to abuse who though she were with weariness nigh dead yet would not let her lite nor rest a little stead for he was stern and terrible by nature and eke of person huge and hideous exceeding much the measure of men stature and rather like a giant monstruous forsooth he was descended of the house of those old giants which did wars deraign against the heaven in order battailous and sib to great orgolio which was slain by arthure when as vnas knight he did maintain his looks were dreadful and his fiery eyes like two great beacons glared bright and wide glancing askew as if his enemies he scorned in his overweening pride and stalking stately like a crane did stride at every step upon the tiptoes high and all the way he went on every side he gazed about and stared horribly as if he with his looks would all men terrify he wore no armour ne for none did care as no whit dreading any living wight but in a jacket quilted richly rare upon checklaton he was strangely dight and on his head a roll of linen plighted like to the moors of malaber he wore with which his locks as black as pitchy night were bound about and voided from before and in his hand a mighty iron club he boar this was disdain who led that ladies horse through thick & thin through mountains & through plains compelling her where she would not by force haling her palfrey by the hempen reins but that same fool which most increased her pains was scorn who having in his hand a whip her therewith jerks and still when she complains the more he laughs and does her closely quip to see her soar lament and bite her tender lip whose cruel handling when that squire beheld and saw those villains her so vildly use his gentle heart with indignation swelled and could no longer bear so great abuse as such a lady so to beat and bruise but to him stepping such a stroke him lent that forced him halter from his hand to lose and maugre all his might back to relent else had he surely there be slain or foully shent the villain wroth for greeting him so soar gathered him self together soon again and with his iron baton which he boar let driven at him so dreadfully amain that for his safety he did him constrain to give him ground and shift to every side rather then once his burden to sustain for bootless thing him seemed to abide so mighty blows or prove the puissance of his pride like as a mastiff having at a bay a salvage bull whose cruel horns do threat desperate danger if he them assay traces his ground and round about does beatrice to spy where he may some advantage get the while the beast does rage and loudly roar so did the squire the while the carl did fret and fume in his disdainful mind the more and oftentimes by turmagant and mahound swore natheless so sharply still he him pursued that at advantage him at last he took when his foot slipped that slip he dearly rued and with his iron club to ground him struck where still he lay ne out of swoon awoke till heavy hand the carl upon him laid and bound him fast though when he up did look and saw him self captived he was dismayed ne pour had to withstand ne hope of any aid then up he made himself and forward fare led in a rope which both his hands did bind ne ought that fool for pity did him spare but with his whip him following behind him often scourged and forced his feet to find and other while with bitter mocks and mows he would him scorn that to his gentle mind was much more grievous then the others blows words sharply wound but greatest grief of scorning grows the fair serena when she saw him fallen under that villains club then surely thought that slain he was or made a wretched thrall and fled away with all the speed she might to seek for safety which long time she sought and passed through many perils by the way ere she again to calepine was brought the which discourse as now i must delay till mirabellaes fortune's i do further say cant. viii prince arthure overcomes disdain quites mirabell from dread serena found of salvages by calepine is freed you gentle ladies in whose sovereign pour love hath the glory of his kingdom left and th'hearts of men as your eternal dowry in iron chains of liberty bereft delivered hath into your hands by gift be well aware how you the same do use that pride do not to tyranny you lift lest if men you of cruelty accuse he from you take that chiefdom which you do abuse and as you soft and tender are by kind adorned with goodly gifts of beauty's grace so be you soft and tender eke in mind but cruelty and hardness from you chase that all your other praises will deface and from you turn the love of men to hate ensample take of mirabellaes case who from the high degree of happy state fell into wretched woes which she repented late who after thraldom of the gentle squire which she beheld with lamentable eye was touched with compassion entire and much lamented his calamity that for her sake fell into misery which booted nought for prayers nor for threat to hope for to release or mollify for aye the more that she did them entreat the more they him misused and cruelly did beatrice so as they forward on their way did pass him still reviling and afflicting soar they met prince arthure with sir enias that was that courteous knight whom he before having subdued yet did to life restore to whom as they approached they gan augment their cruelty and him to punish more scourging and haling him more vehement as if it them should grieve to see his punishment the squire him self when as he saw his lord the witness of his wretchedness in place was much ashamed that with and hempen cord he like a dog was led in captive case and did his head for bashfulness abase as loath to see or to be seen at all shame would be hid but whenas enias beheld two such of two such villains thrall his manly mind was much immoved therewithal and to the prince thus said see you sir knight the greatest shame that ever eye yet saw yond lady and her squire with foul despite abused against all reason and all law without regard of pity or of awe see how they do that squire beatrice and revile see how they do the lady hale and draw but if you please to lend me leave a while i will them soon acquit and both of blame assoil the prince assented and then he straight way dismounting light his shield about him threw with which approaching thus he gan to say abide you caitiff traitors untrue that have with treason thralled unto you these two unworthy of your wretched bans and now your crime with cruelty pursue abide and from them lay your loathly hands or else abide the death that hard before you stands the villain stayed not answer to invent but with his iron club preparing way his minds sad message back unto him sent the which descended with such dreadful sway that seemed nought the course thereof could stay no more then lightning from the lofty sky ne list the knight the pour thereof assay whose doom was death but lightly slipping by unwares defrauded his intended destiny and to requite him with the like again with his sharp sword he fiercely at him flew and struck so strongly that the carl with pain saved him self but that he there him slew yet saved not so but that the blood it drew and gave his foe good hope of victory who therewith fleshed upon him set anew and with the second stroke thought certainly to have supplied the first and paid the usury but fortune answered not unto his call for as his hand was heaved up on hight the villain met him in the middle fallen and with his club bet back his brandiron bright so forcibly that with his own hands might rebeaten back upon him self again he driven was to ground in self despite from whence ere he recovery could gain he in his neck had set his foot with fell disdain with that the fool which did that end await came running in and whilst on ground he lay laid heavy hands on him and held so strait that down he kept him with his scornful sway so as he could not wielded him any way the while that other villain went about him to have bound and thralled without delay the while the fool did him revile and flout threatening to yoke them tow & tame their courage stout as when a sturdy ploughman with his hind by strength have overthrown a stubborn steer they down him hold and fast with cords do bind till they him force the buxom yoke to bear so did these two this knight oft tug and tear which when the prince beheld there standing by he left his lofty steed to aid him near and buckling soon him self gan fiercely fly upon that carl to save his friend from jeopardy the villain leaving him unto his mate to be captived and handled as he list himself addressed unto this new debate and with his club him all about so blessed that he which way to turn him scarcely wist sometime aloft he laid sometime allow now here now there and oft him near he missed so doubtfully that hardly one could know whither more wary were to give or ward the blow but yet the prince so well enured was with such huge strokes approved oft in fight that way to them he gave forth right to pass ne would endure the danger of their might but wait advantage when they down did light at last the caitiff after long discourse when all his strokes he saw avoided quite resolved in one t'assemble all his force and make one end of him without ruth or remorse his dreadful hand he heaved up aloft and with his dreadful instrument of ire thought sure have pounded him to powder soft or deep emboweled in the earth entire but fortune did not with his will conspire for ere his stroke attained his intent the noble child preventing his desire under his club with wary boldness went and smote him on the knee that never yet was bent it never yet was bent ne bent it now albe the stroke so strong and puissant were that seemed a marble pillar it could bow but all that leg which did his body bear it cracked throughout yet did no blood appear so as it was unable to support so huge a burden on such broken gear but fell to ground like to a lump of dirt whence he assayed to rise but could not for his hurt eftsoones the prince to him full nimbly stepped and lest he should recover foot again his head meant from his shoulders to have swept which when the lady saw she cried amain stay stay sir knight for love of god abstain for that unwares you weetless do intend slay not that carl though worthy to be slain for more on him does then him self depend my life will by his death have lamentable end he stayed his hand according her desire yet nathemore him suffered to arise but still suppressing gan of her inquire what meaning mote those uncouth words comprise that in that villains health her safety lies that were no might in man nor heart in knights which durst her dreaded rescue enterprise yet heavens them selves that favour feeble rights would for it self redress and punish such despites then bursting forth in tears which gushed fast like many water streams a while she stayed till the sharp passion being overpassed her tongue to her restored then thus she said nor heavens nor men can me most wretched maid deliver from the doom of my desert the which the god of love hath on me laid and damned to endure this direful smart for penance of my proud and hard rebellious heart in prime of youthly years when first the flower of beauty gan to bud and bloom delight and nature me endued with plenteous dowry of all her gifts that pleased each living sighed i was beloved of many a gentle knight and sued and sought with all the service due full many a one for me deep groaned and sighed and to the door of death for sorrow drew complaining out on me that would not on them rew but let them love that list or live or die me list not die for any lovers dole ne list me leave my loved liberty to pity him that list to play the fool to love my self i learned had in school thus i triumphed long in lovers pain and sitting careless on the scorner's stool did laugh at those that did lament and plain but all is now repaid with interest again for lo the winged god that wounds hearts caused me be called to account therefore and for revengement of those wrongful smarts which i to others did inflict afore dempt me to endure this penance soar that in this wise and this unmeet array with these two lewd companions and no more disdain and scorn i through the world should stray till i have saved so many as i erst did slay certes said then the prince the god is just that takes vengeance of his peoples spoil for were no law in love but all that lust might them oppress and painfully turmoil his kingdom would continue but a while but tell me lady wherefore do you bear this bottle thus before you with such toil and eke this wallet at your back arrear that for these carls to carry much more comely were here in this bottle said the sorry maid i put the tears of my contrition till to the brim i have it full defrayed and in this bag which i behind me done i put repentance for things past and gone yet is the bottle leak and bag so torn that all which i put in falls out anon and is behind me trodden down of scorn who mocks all my pain & laughs the more i mourn the infant hearkened wisely to her tale and wondered much at cupids judgement wise that could so meekly make proud hearts avail and wreak him self on them that him despise then suffered he disdain up to arise who was not able up him self to rear by means his leg through his late luckless prize was cracked in twaine but by his foolish fear was helped up who him supported standing near but being up he looked again aloft as if he never had received fallen and with stern eyebrows stared at him oft as if he would have daunted him with all and standing on his tiptoes to seem tall down on his golden feet he often gazed as if such pride the other could appall who was so far from being ought amazed that he his looks despised and his boast dispraised then turning back unto that captive thrall who all this while stood there beside them bound unwilling to be known or seen at all he from those bans weened him to have unwound but when approaching near he plainly found it was his own true groom the gentle squire he thereat waxed exceedingly astounded and him did oft embrace and oft admire ne could with seeing satisfy his great desire mean while the salvage man when he beheld that huge great fool oppressing th'other knight whom with his weight unwieldy down he held he flew upon him like a greedy kite unto some carrion offered to his sighed and down him plucking with his nails and teeth gan him to hale and tear and scratch and bite and from him taking his own whip therewith so soar him scourges that the blood down follows and sure i ween had not the ladies cry procured the prince his cruel hand to stay he would with whipping him have done to die but being checked he did abstain straight way and let him rise then thus the prince gan say now lady sith your fortune's thus dispose that if you list have liberty you may unto your self i freely leave to chosen whither i shall you leave or from these villains loose ah nay sir knight said she it may not be but that i needs must by all means fulfil this penance which enjoined is to me lest unto me betide a greater ill yet no less thanks to you for your good will so humbly taking leave she turned aside but arthure with the rest went onward still on his first quest in which did him betide a great adventure which did him from them divide but first it falls me by course to tell of fair serena who as erst you herd when first the gentle squire at variance fell with those two carls fled fast away afeard of villainy to be to her inferred so fresh the image of her former dread yet dwelling in her eye to her appeared that every foot did tremble which did tread and every body two and two she foure did read through hills & dales through bushes & through briers long thus she fled till that at last she thought her self now passed the peril of her fears then looking round about and seeing nought which doubt of danger to her offer might she from her palfrey lighted on the plain and sitting down her self a while bethought of her long travel and turmoiling pain and often did of love and oft of luck complain and evermore she blamed calepine the good sir calepine her own true knight as only author of her woeful tine for being of his love to her so light as her to leave in such a piteous plighted yet never turtle truer to his make then he was tried unto his lady bright who all this while endured for her sake great peril of his life and restless pains did take tho when as all her plaints she had displayed and well disburdened her engrieved breast upon the grass her self adown she laid where being tired with travel and oppressed with sorrow she betook her self to rest there whilst in morpheus bosom safe she lay fearless of ought that mote her peace molest false fortune did her safety betray unto a strange mischance that menaced her decay in these wild deserts where she now abided there dwelled a salvage nation which did live of stealth and spoil and making nightly road into their neighbours borders ne did give them selves to any trade as for to driven the painful plough or cattle for to breed or by adventurous merchandise to thrive but on the labours of poor men to feed and serve their own necessities with others need thereto they used one most accursed order to eat the flesh of men whom they mote find and strangers to devour which on their border were brought by error or by wreckful wind a monstrous cruelty gainst course of kind they towards evening wandering every way to seek for booty came by fortune blind whereas this lady like a sheep astray now drowned in the depth of sleep all fearless lay soon as they spied her lord what gladful glee they made among them selves but when her face like the fair ivory shining they did see each gan his fellow solace and embrace for joy of such good hap by heavenly grace then gan they to devise what course to take whither to slay her there upon the place or suffer her out of her sleep to wake and then her eat atonce or many meals to make the best advisement was of bad to let her sleep out her fill without encumberment for sleep they said would make her battle better then when she waked they all gave one consent that since by grace of god she there was sent unto their god they would her sacrifice whose share her guiltless blood they would present but of her dainty flesh they did devise to make a common feast & feed with gourmandise so round about her they them selves did place upon the grass and diversely dispose as each thought best to spend the lingering space some with their eyes the daintiest morsels chosen some praise her paps some praise her lips and nose some whet their knives and strip their elbows bore the priest him self a garland does compose of finest flowers and with full busy care his bloody vessels wash and holy fire prepare the damosel wakes then all atonce upstarted and round about her flock like many flies whooping and hallowing on every part as if they would have rend the brazen skies which when she sees with ghastly griefful eyes her heart does quake and deadly pallid hew benumbs her cheeks then out aloud she cries where none is nigh to hear that will her rew and rends her golden locks and snowy breasts embrew but all boots not they hands upon her lay and first they spoil her of her iewls deer and afterwards of all her rich array the which among them they in pieces tear and of the pray each one a part does bear now being naked to their sordid eyes the goodly treasures of nature appear which as they view with lustful fantasies each wishes to him self and to the rest envies her ivory neck her alabaster breast her paps which like white silken pillows were for love in soft delight thereon to rest her tender sides her belly white and clear which like and altar did it self uprear to offer sacrifice divine thereon her goodly thighs whose glory did appear like a triumphal arch and thereupon the spoils of princes hanged which were in battle wone those dainty parts the darlings of delight which mote not be profaned of common eyes those villains viewed with lose lascivious sighed and closely tempted with their crafty spies and some of them gan amongst themselves devise thereof by force to take their beastly pleasure but them the priest rebuking did advise ▪ to dare not to pollute so sacred treasure vowed to the gods religion held even thieves in measure so being stayed they her from thence directed unto a little grove not far aside in which and altar shortly they erected to slay her on and now the eventide his broad black wings had through the heavens wide by this dispread that was the time ordained for such a dismal deed their guilt to hide of few green turfs and altar soon they feigned and decked it all with flowers which they nigh hand obtained tho when as all things ready were aright the damosel was before the altar set being already dead with fearful fright to whom the priest with naked arms full net approaching nigh and murderous knife well whet gan mutter close a certain secret charm with other devilish ceremonies met which done he gan aloft advance his arm whereat they shouted all and made a loud alarm then gan the bagpipes and the horns to shrill and shriek aloud that with the peoples voice confused did the air with terror fill and made the wood to tremble at the noise the whiles she wailed the more they did rejoice now mote you understand that to this grove sir calepine by chance more then by choice the self same evening fortune hither drove as he to seek serena through the woods did rove long had he sought her and through many a soil had traveled still on foot in heavy arms ne ought was tired with his endless toils ne ought was feared of his certain harms and now all weetless of the wretched storms in which his love was lost he slept full fast till being waked with these loud alarms he lightly started up like one aghast and catching up his arms straight to the noise forth past there by th'vncertaine glims of starry night and by the twinkling of their sacred fire he mote perceive a little dawning sighed of all which there was doing in that choir amongst whom a woman spoiled of all attire he spied lamenting her unlucky strife and groaning soar from grieved heart entire eftsoons he saw one with a naked knife ready to launch her breast and let out loved life with that he thrusts into the thickest throng and even as his right hand adown descends he him preventing lays on earth along and sacrifices to infernal fiends then to the rest his wrathful hand he bends of whom he makes such havoc and such hew that swarms of damned souls to hell he sends the rest that escape his sword and death eschew fly like a flock of doves before a falcons view from them returning to that lady back whom by the altar he does sitting find yet fearing death and next to death the lack of clothes to cover what they ought by kind he first her hands begins to unbind and then to question of her present woe and afterwards to cheer with speeches kind but she for nought that he could say or do one word durst speak or answer him awhit thereto so inward shame of her uncomely case she did conceive through care of womanhood that though the night did cover her disgrace yet she in so unwomanly a mood would not bewray the state in which she stood so all that night to him unknown she passed but day that does discover bad and good ensuing made her known to him at last the end whereof i'll keep until another cast cant. ix calidore hosts with meliboe and loves fair pastorell coridon envies him yet he for ill rewards him well now turn again my teem thou jolly swain back to the furrow which i lately left i lately left a furrow one or twayne unploughed the which my coulter hath not cleft yet seemed the soil both fair and fruitful eft as i it past that were too great a shame that so rich fruit should be from us bereft beside the great dishonour and defame which should befall to calidores immortal name great travel hath the gentle calidore and toil endured sith i left him last sewing the blatant beast which i forbore to finish then for other present haste full many paths and perils he hath passed through hills through dales through forests & through plains in that same quest which fortune on him cast which he achieved to his own great gains reaping eternal glory of his restless pains so sharply he the monster did pursue that day nor night he suffered him to rest ne rested he himself but nature's due for dread of danger not to be redressed if he for sloth forslacked so famous quest him first from court he to the cities coursed and from the cities to the towns him pressed and from the towns into the country forced and from the country back to private farms he scorsed from thence into the open fields he fled whereas the herds were keeping of their neat and shepherds singing to their flocks that fed lays of sweet love and youths delightful heat him thither eke for all his fearful threat he followed fast and chased him so nigh that to the folds where sheep at night do seat and to the little cots where shepherd's lie in winter's wrathful time he forced him to fly there on a day as he pursued the chase he chanced to spy a sort of shepherd grooms playing on pipes and caroling apace the whiles their beasts there in the budded brooms beside them fed and nipped the tender blooms for other worldly wealth they cared nought to whom sir calidore yet sweating comes and them to tell him courteously besought if such a beast they saw which he had thither brought they answered him that no such beast they saw nor any wicked fiend that mote offend their happy flocks nor danger to them draw but if that such there were as none they kenned they prayed high god them far from them to send then one of them him seeing so to sweat after his rustic wise that well he weened offered him drink to quench his thirsty heat and if he hungry were him offered eke to eat the knight was nothing nice where was no need and took their gentle offer so adown they prayed him fit and gave him for to feed such homely what as serves the simple clown that does despise the dainties of the town tho having fed his fill he there beside saw a fair damosel which did wear a crown of sundry flowers with silken ribbons tied clad in home-made green that her own hands had died upon a little hillock she was placed higher then all the rest and round about environed with a garland goodly graced of lovely lasses and them all without the lusty shepherd swains sat in a rout the which did pipe and sing her praises due and oft rejoice and oft for wonder shout as if some miracle of heavenly hew were down to them descended in that earthly view and soothly sure she was full fair of face and perfectly well shaped in every limb which she did more augment with modest grace and comely carriage of her countenance trim that all the rest like lesser lamps did dim who her admiring as some heavenly wight did for their sovereign goddess her esteem and caroling her name both day and night the fairest pastorella her by name did hight ne was there herd ne was there shepherds swain but her did honour and eke many a one burned in her love and with sweet pleasing pain full many a night for her did sighs and groan but most of all the shepherd coridon for her did languish and his deer life spend yet neither she for him nor other none did care a whit ne any liking lend though mean her lot yet higher did her mind ascend her whiles sir calidore there viewed well and marked her rare demeanour which him seemed so far the mean of shepherds to excel as that he in his mind her worthy deemed to be a princes paragon esteemed he was unwares surprised in subtle bans of the blind boy ne thence could be redeemed by any skill out of his cruel hands caught like the bird which gazing still on others stands so stood he still long gazing thereupon ne any will had thence to move away although his quest were far afore him gone but after he had fed yet did he stay and sat there still until the flying day was far forth spent discoursing diversely of sundry things as fell to work delay and evermore his speech he did apply to heards but meant them to the damsels fantasy by this the moisty night approaching fast her dewy humour gan on earth to shed that warned the shepherds to their homes to hast their tender flocks now being fully fed for fear of wetting them before their bed then came to them a good old aged sire whose silver locks bedecked his beard and head with shepherds hook in hand and fit attire that willed the damosel rise the day did now expire he was to weet by common voice esteemed the father of the fairest pastorell and of her self in very deed so deemed yet was not so but as old stories tell found her by fortune which to him befell in open fields and infant left alone and taking up brought home and nursed well as his own child for other he had none that she in tract of time accounted was his own she at his bidding meekly did arise and straight unto her little flock did fare then all the rest about her rose likewise and each his sundry sheep with several care gathered together and them homeward bore whilst every one with helping hands did strive among themselves and did their labours share to help fair pastorella home to driven her fleecy flock but coridon most help did give but meliboee so hight that good old man now seeing calidore left all alone and night arrived hard at hand began him to invite unto his simple home which though it were a cottage clad with loom and all things therein mean yet better so to lodge then in the salvage fields to room the knight full gladly soon agreed thereto being his hearts own wish and home with him did go there he was welcomed of that honest sire and of his aged beldame homely well who him besought himself to disattire and rest himself till supper time befell by which home came the fairest pastorell after her flock she in their fold had tied and supper ready dight they to it fell with small ado and nature satisfied the which does little crave contented to abide tho when they had their hunger slaked well and the fair maid the table taken away the gentle knight as he that did excel in courtesy and well could do and say for so great kindness as he found that day gan greatly thank his host and his good wife and drawing thence his speech another way gan highly to commend the happy life which shepherds led without debate or bitter strife how much said he more happy is the state in which you father here do dwell at ease leading a life so free and fortunate from all the tempests of these worldly seas which toss the rest in dangerous disease where wars and wrecks and wicked enmity do them afflict which no man can appease that certes i your happiness envy and wish my lot were placed in such felicity surely my son then answered he again if happy then it is in this intent that having small yet do i not complain of want ne wish for more it to augment but do my self with that i have content so taught of nature which does little need of foreign helps to life's due nourishment the fields my food my flock my raiment breed no better do i wear no better do i feed therefore i do not any one envy nor am envied of any one therefore they that have much fear much to lose thereby and store of cares does follow riches store the little that i have grows daily more without my care but only to attend it my lambs do every year increase their score and my flocks father daily does amend it what have i but to praise th'almighty that does send it to them that list the world's gay shows i leave and to great ones such follies do forgive which oft through pride do their own peril weave and through ambition down themselves do driven to sad decay that might contented live me no such cares nor cumbrous thoughts offend ne once my minds unmoved quiet grieve but all the night in silver sleep i spend and all the day to what i list i do attend sometime i hunt the fox the vowed foe unto my lambs and him dislodge away sometime the fawn i practise from the doe or from the goat her kid how to convey another while i baits and nets display the birds to catch or fish to beguile and when i weary am i down do lay my limbs in every shade to rest from toil and drink of every brook when thirst my throat does boil the time was once in my first prime of years when pride of youth forth pricked my desire that i disdained among mine equal pears to follow sheep and shepherds base attire for further fortune then i would inquire and leaving home to royal court i sought where i did fell my self for yearly hire and in the princes garden daily wrought there i beheld such vainness as i never thought with sighed whereof soon cloyed and long deluded with idle hope's which them do entertain after i had ten years my self excluded from native home and spent my youth in vain i gan my follies to my self to plain and this sweet peace whose lack did then appear tho back returning to my sheep again i from thenceforth have learned to love more deer this lowly quiet life which i inherit here whilst thus he talked the knight with greedy ear hung still upon his melting mouth attended whose senseful words empierced his heart so near that he was rapt with double ravishment both of his speech that wrought him great content and also of the object of his view on which his hungry eye was always bent that betwixt his pleasing tongue and her fair hew he lost himself and like one half entranced grew yet to occasion means to work his mind and to insinuate his hearts desire he thus replied now surely sire i find that all this world's gay shows which we admire be but vain shadows to this safe retire of life which here in lowliness you led fearless of foes or fortune's wrackful ire which tosses states and under foot does tread the mighty ones afraid of every changes dread that even i which daily do behold the glory of the great amongst whom i wone and now have proved what happiness you hold in this small plot of your dominion now loath great lordship and ambition and wish heavens so much had graced me as grant me live in like condition or that my fortune's might transposed be from pitch of higher place unto this low degree in vain said then old meliboe do men the heavens of their fortune's fault accuse sith they know best what is the best for them for they to each such fortune do diffuse as they do know each can most aptly use for not that which men covet most is best nor that thing worst which men do most refuse but fittest is that all contented rest with that they hold each hath his fortune in his breast it is the mind that makes good or ill that makes wretch or happy rich or poor for some that hath abundance at his will hath not enough but wants in greatest store and other that hath little asks no more but in that little is both rich and wise for wisdom is most riches fools therefore they are which fortune's do by vows devise sith each unto himself his life may fortunize since then in each men self said calidore it is to fashion his own life's estate give leave awhile good father in this shore to rest my bark which hath be beaten late with storms of fortune and tempestuous fate in seas of troubles and of toilsome pain that whither quite from them for to retreat i shall resolve or back to turn again i may here with your self some small repose obtain not that the burden of so bold a guest shall chargeful be or change to you at all for your mean food shall be my daily feast and this your cabin both my bower and hall beside for recompense hereof i shall you well reward and golden guerdon give that may perhaps you better much withal and in this quiet make you safer live so forth he drew much gold and towards him it driven but the good man nought tempted with the offer of his rich mould did thrust it far away and thus bespoke sir knight your bounteous proffer be far from me to whom you ill display that mucky mass the cause of men's decay that mote impair my peace with dangers dread but if you algates covet to assay this simple sort of life that shepherds led be it your own our rudeness to your self aread so there that night sir calidore did dwell and long while after whilst him list remain daily beholding the fair pastorell and feeding on the bait of his own bane during which time he did her entertain with all kind courtesies he could invent and every day her company to gain when to the field she went he with her went so for to quench his fire he did it more augment but she that never had acquainted been with such quaint usage fit for queens and kings ne ever had such knightly service seen but being bred under base shepherds wings had ever learned to love the lowly things did little whit regard his courteous guise but cared more for colins carolings then all that he could do or ever devise his lays his loves his looks she did them all despise which calidore perceiving thought it best to change the manner of his lofty look and doffing his bright arms himself addressed in shepherds weed and in his hand he took in stead of steelhead spear a shepherds hook that who had seen him then would have bethought on phrygian paris by plexippus brook when he the love of fair benone sought what time the golden apple was unto him brought so being clad unto the fields he went with the fair pastorella every day and kept her sheep with diligent attended watching to driven the ravenous wolf away the whilst at pleasure she mote sport and play and every evening helping them to fold and otherwhiles for need he did assay in his strong hand their rugged teats to hold and out of them to press the milk love so much could which seeing coridon who her likewise long time had loved and hoped her love to gain he much was troubled at that strangers guise and many jealous thoughts conceived in vain that this of all his labour and long pain should reap the harvest ere it ripened were that made him scowl and pout and oft complain of pastorell to all the shepherds there that she did love a stranger swain then him more dear and ever when he came in company where calidore was present he would lour and bite his lip and even for jealousy was ready oft his own heart to devour impatient of any paramour who on the other side did seem so far from malicing or grudging his good hour that all he could he graced him with her ne ever showed sign of rancour or of jar and oft when coridon unto her brought or little sparrows stolen from their nest or wanton squirrels in the woods far sought or other dainty thing for her addressed he would commend his gift and make the best yet she no whit his presents did regard ne him could find to fancy in her breast this newcome shepherd had his market marred old love is little worth when new is more preferred one day when as the shepherd swains together were met to make their sports and merry glee as they are wont in fair sunshiny weather the while their flocks in shadows shrouded be they fell to dance then did they all agree that colin clout should pipe as one most fit and calidore should led the ring as he that most in pastorellaes grace did fit thereat frowned coridon and his lip closely bit but calidore of courteous inclination took coridon and set him in his place that he should led the dance as was his fashion for coridon could dance and trimly trace and when as pastorella him to grace her flowery garland took from her own head and placed on his he did it soon displace and did it put on coridons in stead then coridon wox frolic that erst seemed dead another time when as they did dispose to practise games and masteries to try they for their judge did pastorella chosen a garland was the meed of victory there coridon forth stepping openly did challenge calidore to wrestling game for he through long and perfect industry therein well practised was and in the same thought sure avenge his grudge & work his foe great shame but calidore he greatly did mistake for he was strong and mightily stiff pight that with one fallen his neck he almost brake and had he not upon him fallen light his dearest joint he sure had broken quite then was the oaken crown by pastorell given to calidore as his due right but he that did in courtesy excel gave it to coridon and said he won it well thus did the gentle knight himself abear among that rustic rout in all his deeds that even they the which his rivals were could not malign him but commend him needs for courtesy among the rudest breeds good will and favour so it surely wrought with this fair maid and in her mind the seeds of perfect love did sow that last forth brought the fruit of joy and bliss though long time dearly bought thus calidore continued there long time to win the love of the fair pastorell which having god he used without crime or blameful blot but managed so well that he of all the rest which there did well was favoured and to her grace commended but what strange fortune's unto him befell ere he attained the point by him intended shall more conveniently in other place be ended cant. x. calidore sees the graces dance to colins melody the while his pastorell is led into captivity who now does follow the foul blatant beast whilst calidore does follow that fair maid unmindful of his vow and high behest which by the fairy queen was on him laid that he should never leave nor be delayed from chasing him till he had it achieved but now entrapped of love which him betrayed he minds more how he may be relieved with grace from her whose love his heart hath soar engrieved that from henceforth he means no more to sew his former quest so full of toil and pain another quest another game in view he hath the guerdon of his love to gain with whom he minds for ever to remain and set his rest among the rustic sort rather then hunt still after shadows vain of courtly favour fed with light report of every blast and sailing always on the port ne certes mote he greatly blamed be from so high step to stoop unto so low for who had tasted once as oft did he the happy peace which there does overflow and proved the perfect pleasures which do grow among poor hinds in hills in woods in dales would never more delight in painted show of such false bliss as there is set for stales t'entrap unwary fools in their eternal bales for what hath all that goodly glorious gaze like to one sighed which calidore did view the glance whereof their dimmed eyes would daze that never more they should endure the show of that sunshine that makes them look askew ne ought in all that world of beauty's rare save only glorianaes heavenly hew to which what can compare can it compare the which as comes now by course i will declare one day as he did range the fields abroad whilst his fair pastorella was elsewhere he chanced to come far from all peoples troad unto a place whose pleasance did appear to pass all others on the earth which were for all that ever was by nature's skill devised to work delight was gathered there and there by her were poured forth at fill as if this to adorn she all the rest did pill it was and hill placed in and open plain that round about was bordered with a wood of matchless hight that seemed earth to disdain in which all trees of honour stately stood and did all winter as in summer bud spreading pavilions for the birds to bower which in their lower branches sung aloud and in their tops the soaring hawk did tower sitting like king of fowls in majesty and pour and at the foot thereof a gentle flood his silver waves did softly tumble down unmarred with ragged moss or filthy mud ne mote wild beasts ne mote the ruder clown thereto approach ne filth mote therein drown but nymphs and fairies by the banks did fit in the woods shade which did the waters crown keeping all noisome things away from it and to the waters fallen tuning their accents fit and on the top thereof a spacious plain did spread it self to serve to all delight either to dance when they to dance would feign or else to course about their bases light ne ought there wanted which for pleasure might desired be or thence to banish bale so pleasantly the hill with equal hight did seem to overlook the lowly vale therefore it rightly cleped was mount acidale they say that venus when she did dispose her self to pleasance used to resort unto this place and therein to repose and rest her self as in a gladsome port or with the graces there to play and sport that even her own cytheron though in it she used most to keep her royal court and in her sovereign majesty to fit she in regard hereof refused and thought unfit unto this place when as the elfin knight approached him seemed that the merry found of a shrill pipe he playing herd on hight and many feet fast thumping hollow ground that through the woods their echo did rebound he nigher drew to weet what mote it be there he a troop of ladies dancing found full merrily and making gladful glee and in the midst a shepherd piping he did see he durst not enter into open green for dread of them unwares to be descried for breaking of their dance if he were seen but in the covert of the wood did bide beholding all yet of them unespied there he did see that pleased much his sighed that even he him self his eyes envied and hundred naked maidens lily white all ranged in a ring and dancing in delight all they without were ranged in a ring and danced round but in the midst of them three other ladies did both dance and sing the whilst the rest them round about did hem and like a garland did in compass stem and in the midst of those same three was placed another damosel as a precious gem amid a ring most richly well enchased that with her goodly presence all the rest much graced look how the crown which ariadne wore upon her ivory forehead that same day that theseus her unto his bridal boar when the bold centaur's made that bloody fray with the fierce lapithes which did them dismay being now placed in the firmament through the bright heaven does her beams display and is unto the stars and ornament which round about her move in order excellent such was the beauty of this goodly band whose sundry parts were here too long to tell but she that in the midst of them did stand seemed all the rest in beauty to excel crowned with a rosy garland that right well did her beseem and ever as the crew about her danced sweet flowers that far did smell and fragrant odours they upon her threw but most of all those three did her with gifts endue those were the graces daughters of delight handmaidens of venus which are wont to haunt upon this hill and dance there day and night those three to men all gifts of grace do grant and all that venus in her self does vaunt is borrowed of them but that fair one that in the midst was placed paravant was she to whom that shepherd piped alone that made him pipe so merrily as never none she was to weet that jolly shepherds lass which piped there unto that merry rout that jolly shepherd which there piped was poor colin clout who knows not colin clout he piped apace whilst they him danced about pipe jolly shepherd pipe thou now apace unto thy love that made thee low to lout thy love is present there with thee in place thy love is there advanced to be another grace much wondered calidore at this strange sighed whose like before his eye had never seen and standing long astonished in spright and rapt with pleasance wist not what to ween whither it were the train of beauty's queen or nymphs or fairies or enchanted show with which his eyes mote have deluded been therefore resolving what it was to know out of the wood he rose and towards them did go but soon as he appeared to their view they vanished all away out of his sighed and clean were gone which way he never knew all save the shepherd who for fell despite of that displeasure broke his bagpipe quite and made great moan for that unhappy turn but calidore though no less sorry wight for that mishap yet seeing him to mourn drew near that he the truth of all by him mote learn and first him greeting thus unto him spoke hail jolly shepherd which thy joyous days here leadest in this goodly merry make frequented of these gentle nymphs always which to thee flock to hear thy lovely lays tell me what mote these dainty damsels be which here with thee do make their pleasant plays right happy thou that mayest them freely see but why when i them saw fled they away from me not i so happy answered then that swain as thou unhappy which them thence didst chase whom by no means thou canst recall again for being gone none can them bring in place but whom they of them selves list so to grace right sorry i said then sir calidore that my ill fortune did them hence displace but since things passed none may now restore tell me what were they all whose lack thee grieves so soar tho gan that shepherd thus for to dilate then wot thou shepherd whatsoever thou be that all those ladies which thou sawest late are venus damsels all with in her fee but differing in honour and degree they all are graces which on her depend beside a thousand more which ready bee her to adorn when so she forth does weened but those three in the midst do chief on her attend they are the daughters of sky-ruling ioue by him begotten of fair eurynome the ocean's daughter in this pleasant grove as he this way coming from feastful glee of thetis wedding with aecidee in summers shade him self here rested weary the first of them hight mild euphrosyne next fair aglaia last thalia merry sweet goddesses all three which me in mirth do cherry these three on men all gracious gifts bestow which deck the body or adorn the mind to make them lovely or well favoured show as comely carriage entertainment kind sweet semblant friendly offices that bind and all the compliments of courtesy they teach us how to each degree and kind we should our selves demean to low to high to friends to foes which skill men call civility therefore they always smoothly seem to smile that we likewise should mild and gentle be and also naked are that without guile or false dissemblance all them plain may see simple and true from covert malice free and eke them selves so in their dance they boar that two of them still forward seemed to be but one still towards showed her self afore that good should from us go then come in greater store such were those goddesses which you did see but that fourth maid which there amid them traced who can aread what creature mote she be whither a creature or a goddess graced with heavenly gifts from heaven first enraced but what so sure she was she worthy was to be the fourth with those three other placed yet was she certes but a counrtey lass yet she all other country lasses far did pass so far as does the daughter of the day all other lesser lights in light excel so far does she in beautiful array above all other lasses bear the bell ne less in virtue that beseems her well does she exceed the rest of all her raze for which the graces that here wont to dwell have for more honour brought her to this place and graced her so much to be another grace another grace she well deserves to be in whom so many graces gathered are excelling much the mean of her degree divine resemblance beauty sovereign rare firm chastity that spite ne blemish dare all which she with such courtesy does grace that all her peers cannot with her compare but quite are dimmed when she is in place she made me often pipe and now to pipe apace sun of the world great glory of the sky that all the earth dost lighten with thy rays great gloriana greatest majesty pardon thy shepherd amongst so many lays as he hath sung of thee in all his days to make one minime of thy poor handmaid and underneath thy feet to place her praise that when thy glory shall be far displayed to future age of her this mention may be made when thus that shepherd ended had his speech said calidore now sure it irks me that to thy bliss i made this luckless breach as now the author of thy bale to be thus to bereave thy loves deer sighed from thee but gentle shepherd pardon thou my shame who rashly sought that which i mote not see thus did the courteous knight excuse his blame and to recomfort him all comely means did frame in such discourses they together spent long time as fit occasion forth them led with which the knight him self did much content and with delight his greedy fancy fed both of his words which he with reason read and also of the place whose pleasures rare with such regard his senses ravished that thence he had no will away to fare but wished that with that shepherd he mote dwelling share but that envenomed sting the which of yore his poisonous point deep fixed in his heart had left now gan afresh to rankle soar and to renew the rigour of his smart which to recure no skill of leeches art mote him avail but to return again to his wounds worker that with lovely dart dinting his breast had bred his restless pain like as the wounded whale to shore flies from the main so taking leave of that same gentle swain he back returned to his rustic won where his fair pastorella did remain to whom in sort as he at first begun he daily did apply him self to done all dueful service void of thoughts impare ne any pains ne peril did he shun by which he might her to his love allure and liking in her yet untamed heart procure and evermore the shepherd coridon what ever thing he did her to aggrate did strive to match with strong contention and all his pains did closely emulate whither it were to carol as they sat keeping their sheep or games to exercise or to present her with their labours late through which if any grace chanced to arise to him the shepherd straight with jealousy did freeze one day as they all three together went to the green wood to gather strawberries there chanced to them a dangerous accident a tiger forth out of the wood did rise that with fell claws full of fierce gourmandise and greedy mouth wide gaping like hell gate did run at pastorell her to surprise whom she beholding now all desolate gan cry to them aloud to help her all too late which coridon first hearing ran in haste to rescue her but when he saw the fiend through cowherd fear he fled away as fast ne durst abide the danger of the end his life he esteemed dearer then his friend but calidore soon coming to her aid when he the beast saw ready now to rend his loves deer spoil in which his heart was prayed he ran at him enraged in stead of being frayed he had no weapon but his shepherds hook to serve the vengeance of his wrathful will with which so sternly he the monster struck that to the ground astonished he fell whence ere he could recour he did him quell and hewing off his head it presented before the feet of the fair pastorell who scarcely yet from former fear exempted a thousand times him thanked that had her death prevented from that day forth she gan him to affect and daily more her favour to augment but coridon for cowardice reject fit to keep sheep unfit for loves content the gentle heart scorns base disparagement yet calidore did not despise him quite but used him friendly for further intent that by his fellowship he colour might both his estate and love from skill of any wight so well he wood her and so well he wrought her with humble service and with daily suit that at the last unto his will he brought her which he so wisely well did prosecute that of his love he reaped the timely fruit and joyed long in close felicity till fortune fraught with malice blind and brutus that envies lovers long prosperity blew up a bitter storm of foul adversity it fortuned one day when calidore was hunting in the woods as was his trade a lawless people brigants hight of yore that never used to live by plough nor spade but fed on spoil and booty which they made upon their neighbours which did nigh them border the dwelling of these shepherds did invade and spoiled their houses and them selves did murder and drove away their flocks with other much disorder among the rest the which they then did pray they spoiled old melibee of all he had and all his people captive led away amongst which this luckless maid away was lad fair pastorella sorrowful and sad most sorrowful most sad that ever sighed now made the spoil of thieves and brigants bad which was the conquest of the gentlest knight that ever lived and only glory of his might with them also was taken coridon and carried captive by those thieves away who in the covert of the night that none mote them descry nor rescue from their prey unto their dwelling did them close convey their dwelling in a little island was covered with shrubby woods in which no way appeared for people in nor out to pass nor any footing find for overgrown grass for underneath the ground their way was made through hollow caves that no man mote discover for the thick shrubs which did them always shade from view of living wight and covered over but darkness dreaded and daily night did hover through all the inner parts wherein they dwelled ne ligntned was with window nor with lover but with continual candlelight which dealt a doubtful sense of things not so well seen as felt hither those brigants brought their present prey and kept them with continual watch and ward meaning so soon as they convenient may for slaves to fell them for no small reward to merchant's which them kept in bondage hard or sold again now when fair pastorell into this place was brought and kept with guard of grisly thieves she thought her self in hell where with such damned fiends she should in darkness dwell but for to tell the doleful dreariment and pitiful complaints which there she made where day and night she nought did but lament her wretched life shut up in deadly shade and waste her goodly beauty which did fade like to a flower that feels no heat of sun which may her feeble leaves with comfort glade but what befell her in that thievish won will in and other canto better be begun cant. xi the thieves fallen out for pastorell whilst melibee is slain her calidore from them redeems and brings back again the joys of love if they should ever last without affliction or disquietness that worldly chances do among them cast would be on earth too great a blessedness liker to heaven then mortal wretchedness therefore the winged god to let men weet that here on earth is no sure happiness a thousand sours hath tempered with one sweet to make it seem more deer and dainty as is meet like as is now befallen to this fair maid fair pastorell of whom is now my song who being now in dreadful darkness laid among those thieves which her in bondage strong detained yet fortune not with all this wrong contented greater mischief on her threw and sorrows heaped on her in greater throng that who so hears her heaviness would rew and pity her sad plighted so changed from pleasant hew whilst thus she in these hellish dens remained wrapped in wretched cares and hearts unrest it so befell as fortune had ordained that he which was their capitaine professed and had the chief command of all the rest one day as he did all his prisoners view with lustful eyes beheld that lovely guest fair pastorella whose sad mournful hew like the fair morning clad in misty fog did show at sighed whereof his barbarous heart was fired and inly burned with flames most raging hot that her alone he for his part desired of all the other prey which they had god and her in mind did to him self allot from that day forth he kindness to her showed and sought her love by all the means he mote with looks with words with gifts he oft her wowed and mixed threats among and much unto her vowed but all that ever he could do or say her constant mind could not a whit remove nor draw unto the lure of his lewd lay to grant him favour or afford him love yet ceased he not to sew and all ways prove by which he mote accomplish his request saying and doing all that mote behoove ne day nor night he suffered her to rest but her all night did watch and all the day molest at last when him she so importune saw fearing lest he at length the reins would lend unto his lust and make his will his law sith in his pour she was to foe or friend she thought it best for shadow to pretend some show of favour by him gracing small that she thereby mote either freely weened or at more ease continue there his thrall a little well is lent that gains more withal so from thenceforth when love he to her made with better terms she did him entertain which gave him hope and did him half persuade that he in time her joyance should obtain but when she saw through that small favours gain that further then she willing was he pressed she found no means to bar him but to feign a sudden sickness which her soar oppressed and made unfit to serve his lawless minds behest by means whereof she would not him permit once to approach to her in privity but only amongst the rest by her to fit mourning the rigour of her malady and seeking all things meet for remedy but she resolved no remedy to find nor better cheer to show in misery till fortune would her captive bonds unbind her sickness was not of the body but the mind during which space that she thus sick did lie it chanced a sort of merchant's which were wont to skim those coasts for bondmen there to buy and by such traffic after gains to hunt arrived in this isle though bore and blunt t'inquire for slaves where being ready met by some of these same thieves at the instant brunt were brought unto their captain who was set by his fair patients side with sorrowful regret to whom they showed how those merchants were arrived in place their bondslaves for to buy and therefore prayed that those same captives there mote to them for their most commodity be sold and amongst them shared equally this their request the captain much appalled yet could he not their just demand deny and willed straight the slaves should forth be called and sold for most advantage not to be forestalled then forth the good old meliboe was brought and coridon with many other more whom they before in diverse spoils had caught all which he to the merchants sale did show till some which did the sundry prisoners know gan to inquire for that fair shepherdess which with the rest they took not long ago and gan her form and feature to express the more augment her price through praise of comeliness to whom the captain in full angry wise made answer that the maid of whom they spoke was his own purchase and his only prize with which none had to do ne ought partake but he himself which did that conquest make little for him to have one silly lass beside through sickness now so wan and weak that nothing meet in merchandise to pass so showed them her to prove how pale & weak she was the sighed of whom though now decayed and marred and eke but hardly seen by candlelight yet like a diamond of rich regard in doubtful shadow of the darksome night with starry beams about her shining bright these merchants fixed eyes did so amaze that what through wonder & what through delight a while on her they greedily did gaze and did her greatly like and did her greatly praise at last when all the rest them offered were and prizes to them placed at their pleasure they all refused in regard of her ne ought would buy how ever priced with measure withouten her whose worth above all treasure they did esteem and offered store of gold but then the captain fraught with more displeasure bade them be still his love should not be sold the rest take if they would he her to him would hold therewith some other of the chiefest thieves boldly him bade such injury forbear for that same maid how ever it him grieves should with the rest be sold before him there to make the prizes of the rest more deer that with great rage he stoutly does denay and fiercely drawing forth his blade does swear that who so hardy hand on her does lay it dearly shall aby and death for handsel pay thus as they words among them multiply they fallen to strokes the fruit of too much talk and the mad steel about does fiercely fly not sparing wight ne leaving any balk but making way for death at large to walk who in the horror of the grisly night in thousand dreadful shapes does amongst them stalk and makes huge havoc while the candlelight out quenched leaves no skill nor difference of wight like as a sort of hungry dogs met about some carcase by the common way do fallen together striving each to get the greatest portion of the greedy prey all on confused heaps themselves assay and snatch and bite and rend and tug and tear that who them sees would wonder at their fray and who sees not would be afraid to hear such was the conflict of those cruel brigants there but first of all their captives they do kill lest they should join against the weaker side or rise against the remnant at their will old meliboe is slain and him beside his aged wife with many others wide but coridon escaping craftily creeps forth of doors while darkness him does hide and flies away as fast as he can high ne stays leave to take before his friends do die but pastorella woeful wretched elf was by the captain all this while defended who minding more her safety then himself his target always over her pretended by means whereof that mote not be amended he at the length was slain and laid on ground yet holding fast betwixt both his arms extended fair pastorell who with the self same wound launched through the arm fell down with him in dreary swoon there lay she covered with confused press of carcases which dying on her fell tho when as he was dead the fray gan cease and each to other calling did compel to stay their cruel hands from slaughter fell sith they that were the cause of all were gone thereto they all atonce agreed well and lighting candles new gan search anon how many of their friends were slain how many soon their captain there they cruelly found killed and in his arms the dreary dying maid like a sweet angel betwixt two clouds upheld her lovely light was dimmed and decayed with cloud of death upon her eyes displayed yet did the cloud make even that dimmed light seem much more lovely in that darkness laid and betwixt the twinkling of her eyelids bright to spark out little beams like stars in foggy night but when they moved the carcases aside they found that life did yet in her remain then all their helps they busily applied to call the soul back to her home again and wrought so well with labour and long pain that they to life recovered her at last who sighing soar as if her heart in twaine had riven be and all her heart strings braced with dreary drooping eyes looked up like one aghast there she beheld that soar her grieved to see her father and her friends about her lying her self sole left a second spoil to be of those that having saved her from dying renewed her death by timely death denying what now is left her but to wail and weep wringing her hands and ruefully loud crying ne cared she her wound in tears to steep albe with all their might those brigants her did keep but when they saw her now relived again they left her so in charge of one the best of many worst who with unkind disdain and cruel rigour her did much molest scarce yielding her due food or timely rest and scarcely suffering her infestered wound that soar her pained by any to be dressed so leave we her in wretched thraldom bound and turn we back to calidore where we him found who when he back returned from the wood and saw his shepherds cottage spoiled quite and his love reft away he waxed wood and half enraged at that rueful sighed that even his heart for very fell despite and his own flesh he ready was to tear he chafed he grieved he fretted and he sighed and fared like a furious wild bear whose whelps are stolen away she being otherwhere ne wight he found to whom he might complain ne wight he found of whom he might inquire that more increased the anguish of his pain he sought the woods but no man could see there he sought the plains but could no tidings hear the woods did nought but echos vain rebound the plains all waste and empty did appear where wont the shepherds oft their pipes resound and feed and hundred flocks there now not one he found at last as there he roamed up and down he chanced one coming towards him to spy that seemed to be some sorry simple clown with ragged weeds and locks upstaring high as if he did from some late danger fly and yet his fear did follow him behind who as he unto him approached nigh he mote perceive by signs which he did find that coridon it was the silly shepherd's hind tho to him running fast he did not stay to greet him first but asked where were the rest where pastorell who full of fresh dismay and gushing forth in tears was so oppressed that he no word could speak but smit his breast and up to heaven his eyes fast streaming threw whereat the knight amazed yet did not rest but asked again what meant that rueful hew where was his pastorell where all the other crew ah well away said he then sighing soar that ever i did live this day to see this dismal day and was not dead before before i saw fair pastorella die die out alas then calidore did cry how could the death dare ever her to quell but read thou shepherd read what destiny or other direful hap from heaven or hell hath wrought this wicked deed do fear away and tell tho when the shepherd breathed had a while he thus began where shall i then commence this woeful tale or how those brigants vile with cruel rage and dreadful violence spoiled all our cots and carried us from hence or how fair pastorell should have be sold to merchants but was saved with strong defence or how those thieves whilst one sought her to hold fell all at ods and fought through fury fierce and bold in that same conflict woe is me befell this fatal chance this doleful accident whose heavy tidings now i have to tell first all the captives which they here had hent were by them slain by general consent old meliboe and his good wife withal these eyes saw die and dearly did lament but when the lot to pastorell did fallen their captain long withstood & did her death forestall but what could he gainst all them do alone it could not boot needs mote she die at last i only escaped through great confusion of cries and clamours which among them passed in dreadful darkness dreadfully aghast that better were with them to have be dead then here to see all desolate and wast despoiled of those joys and jolly head which with those gentle shepherd's here i wont to led when calidore these rueful news had reached his heart quite deadened was with anguish great and all his wits with dole were nigh distracted that he his face his head his breast did beatrice and death it self unto himself did threat oft cursing heavens that so cruel were to her whose name he often did repeat and wishing oft that he were present there when she was slain or had be to her succour never but after grief awhile had had his course and spent it self in mourning he at last began to mitigate his swelling source and in his mind with better reason cast how he might save her life if life did last or if that dead how he her death might wreak sith otherwise he could not mend thing past or if it to revenge he were too weak then for to die with her and his lives thread to break tho coridon he prayed sith he well knew the ready way unto that thievish won to weened with him and be his conduct true unto the place to see what should be done but he whose heart through fear was late fordone would not for ought be drawn to former dread but by all means the danger known did shun yet calidore so well him wrought with meed and fair bespoke with words that he at last agreed so forth they go together god before both clad in shepherds weeds agreeably and both with shepherds hooks but calidore had underneath him armed privily tho to the place when they approached nigh they chanced upon and hill not far away some flocks of sheep and shepherds to espy to whom they both agreed to take their way in hope there news to learn how they mote best assay there did they find that which they did not fear the self same flocks the which those thieves had reft from meliboe and from themselves whilere and certain of the thieves there by them left the which for want of heards themselves then kept right well knew coridon his own late sheep and seeing them for tender pity wept but when he saw the thieves which did them keep his heart gan fail albe he saw them all asleep but calidore recomforting his grief though not his fear for nought may fear dissuade him hardly forward drew whereas the thief lay sleeping soundly in the bushes shade whom coridon him counseled to invade now all unwares and take the spoil away but he that in his mind had closely made a further purpose would not so them slay but gently waking them gave them the time of day tho sitting down by them upon the green of sundry things he purpose gan to feign that he by them might certain tidings ween of pastorell were she alive or slain amongst which the thieves them questioned again what mister men and eke from whence they were to whom they answered as did appertain that they were poor herdgrooms the which whilere had from their masters fled & now sought hire elsewhere whereof right glad they seemed and offer made to hire them well if they their flocks would keep for they themselves were evil grooms they said unwont with heards to watch or pasture sheep but to foray the land or scour the deep thereto they soon agreed and earnest took to keep their flocks for little hire and cheap for they for better hire did shortly look so there all day they bode till light the sky forsook tho when as towards darksome night it drew unto their hellish dens those thieves them brought where shortly they in great acquaintance grew and all the secrets of their entrails sought there did they find contrary to their thought that pastorell yet lived but all the rest were dead right so as coridon had taught whereof they both full glad and blithe did rest but chiefly calidore whom grief had most possessed at length when they occasion fittest found in dead of night when all the thieves did rest after a late foray and slept full found sir calidore him armed as he thought best having of late by diligent inquest provided him a sword of meanest sort with which he straight went to the captains nest but coridon durst not with him consort ne durst abide behind for dread of worse effort when to the cave they came they found it fast but calidore with huge resistless might the doors assailed and the locks upbraced with noise whereof the thief awaking light unto the entrance ran where the bold knight encountering him with small resistance slew the while fair pastorell through great affright was almost dead misdoubting least of new some uproar were like that which lately she did view but when as calidore was come in and gan aloud for pastorell to call knowing his voice although not herd long since she sudden was revived therewithal and wondrous joy felt in her spirits thrall like him that being long in tempest tossed looking each hour into deaths mouth to fallen at length espies at hand the happy cost on which he safety hope's that erst feared to be lost her gentle heart that now long season passed had never joyance felt nor cheerful thought began some smack of comfort new to taste like life-full heat to numbed senses brought and life to feel that long for death had sought ne less in heart rejoiced calidore when he her found but like to one distracted and robbed of reason towards her him boar a thousand times embraced and kissed a thousand more but now by this with noise of late uproar the hue and cry was raised all about and all the brigants flocking in great store unto the cave gan press nought having doubt of that was done and entered in a rout but calidore in entry close did stand and entertaining them with courage stout still slew the foremost that came first to hand so long till all the entry was with bodies manned tho when no more could nigh to him approach he breathed his sword and rested him till day which when he spied upon the earth encroach through the dead carcases he made his way amongst which he found a sword of better say with which he forth went into open light where all the rest for him did ready stay and fierce assailing him with all their might gan all upon him lay there gan a dreadful fight how many flies in hottest summers day do seize upon some beast whose flesh is bore that all the place with swarms do overlay and with their little stings right felly fare so many thieves about him swarming are all which do him assail on every side and soar oppress ne any him does spare but he does with his raging brand divide their thickest troops & round about him scatters wide like as a lion amongst and herd of dear disperses them to catch his choicest prey so did he fly among them here and there and all that never him came did hew and slay till he had strewed with bodies all the way that none his danger daring to abide fled from his wrath and did themselves convey into their caves their heads from death to hide ne any left that victory to him envied then back returning to his dearest deer he her gan to recomfort all he might with gladful speeches and with lovely cheer and forth her bringing to the joyous light whereof she long had lacked the wishful sighed devise all goodly means from her to driven the sad remembrance of her wretched plighted so her uneath at last he did revive that long had lyen dead and made again alive this done into those thievish dens he went and thence did all the spoils and treasures take which they from many long had robbed and rend but fortune now the victor's meed did make of which the best he did his love betake and also all those flocks which they before had reft from meliboe and from his make he did them all to coridon restore so drove them all away and his love with him boar cant. xii fair pastorella by great hap her parents understands calidore does the blatant beast subdue and bind in bans like as a ship that through the ocean wide directs her course unto one certain cost is met of many a counter wind and tied with which her winged speed is let and crossed and she her self in stormy surges tossed yet making many a board and many a bay still wins way ne hath her compass lost right so it fares with me in this long way whose course is often stayed yet never is astray for all that hitherto hath long delayed this gentle knight from sewing his first quest though out of course yet hath not be missaid to show the courtesy by him professed even unto the lowest and the least but now i come into my course again to his achievement of the blatant beast who all this while at will did range and rain while none was him to stop nor none him to restrain sir calidore when thus he now had reached fair pastorella from those brigants pour unto the castle of belgard her brought whereof was lord the good sir bellamoure who whilom was in his youths freshest flower a lusty knight as ever wielded spear and had endured many a dreadful stour in bloody battle for a lady deer the fairest lady then of all that living were her name was claribell whose father hight the lord of many lands far renowned for his great riches and his greater might he through the wealth wherein he did abound this daughter thought in wedlock to have bound unto the prince of picteland bordering never but she whose sides before with secret wound of love to bellamoure empierced were by all means shunned to match with any foreign fere and bellamour again so well her pleased with daily service and attendance due that of her love he was entirely seized and closely did her wed but known to few which when her father understood he grew in so great rage that them in dungeon deep without compassion cruelly he threw yet did so streightly them a sunder keep that neither could to company of th'other creep natheless sir bellamour whither through grace or secret gifts so with his keepers wrought that to his love sometime he came in place whereof her womb unwist to wight was fraught and in due time a maiden child forth brought which she straight way for dread least if her sire should know thereof to slay he would have sought delivered to her handmaid that for hire she should it cause be fostered under strange attire the trusty damosel bearing it abroad into the empty fields where living wight mote not bewray the secret of her load she forth gan lay unto the open light the little babe to take thereof a sighed whom whilst she did with watery eyes behold upon the little breast like crystal bright she mote perceive a little purple mould that like a rose her silken leaves did fair unfold well she it marked and pitied the more yet could not remedy her wretched case but closing it again like as before bedewed with tears there left it in the place yet left not quite but drew a little space behind the bushes where she her did hide to weet what mortal hand or heavens grace would for the wretched infants help provide for which it loudly called and pitifully cried at length a shepherd which there by did keep his fleecy flock upon the plains around led with the infants cry that loud did weep came to the place where when he wrapped found abandoned spoil he softly it unbound and seeing there that did him pity soar he took it up and in his mantle wound so home unto his honest wife it boar who as her own it nursed and nam evermore thus long continued claribell a thrall and bellamour in bans till that her sire departed life and left unto them all then all the storms of fortune's former ire were turned and they to freedom did retire thenceforth they joyed in happiness together and lived long in peace and love entire without disquiet or dislike of either till time that calidore brought pastorella thither both whom they goodly well did entertain for bellamour knew calidore right well and loved for his prowess sith they twaine long since had fought in field also claribell no less did tender the fair pastorell seeing her weak and wan through durance long there they a while together thus did dwell in much delight and many joys among until the damosel gan to wex more found and strong tho gan sir calidore him to advise of his first quest which he had long forlore ashamed to think how he that enterprise the which the fairy queen had long afore bequeathed to him forslacked had so soar that much he feared least reproachful blame with foul dishonour him mote blot therefore beside the loss of so much loos and fame as through the world thereby should glorify his name therefore resolving to return in haste unto so great achievement he bethought to leave his love now peril being passed with claribell whilst he that monster sought troughout the world and to destruction brought so taking leave of his fair pastorell whom to recomfort all the means he wrought with thanks to bellamour and claribell he went forth on his quest and did that him befell but first ere i do his adventures tell in this exploit me needs to declare what did betide to the fair pastorell during his absence left in heavy care through daily mourning and nightly misfare yet did that ancient matron all she might to cherish her with all things choice and rare and her own handmaid that melissa hight appointed to attend her duly day and night who in a morning when this maiden fair was dighting her having her snowy breast as yet not laced nor her golden hair into their comely tresses duly dressed chanced to espy upon her ivory chest the rosy mark which she remembered well that little infant had which forth she cast the daughter of her lady claribell the which she boar the while i prison she did dwell which well advising straight she gan to cast in her conceitful mind that this fair maid was that same infant which so long sith passed she in the open fields had loosely laid to fortune's spoil unable it to aid so full of joy straight forth she ran in haste unto her mistress being half dismayed to tell her how the heavens had her graced to save her child which in misfortunes mouth was placed the sober mother seeing such her mood yet knowing not what meant that sudden through asked her how mote her words be understood and what the matter was that moved her so my lief said she you know that long xx whilst you in durance dwelled you to me gave a little maid the which you childed though the same again if now you list to have the same is yonder lady whom high god did save much was the lady troubled at that speech and gan to question straight how she it knew most certain marks said she do me it teach for on her breast i with these eyes did view the little purple rose which thereon grew whereof her name you then to her did give beside her countenance and her likely hew matched with equal years do surely prove that yond same is your daughter sure which yet does live the matron stayed no longer to inquire but forth in haste ran to the stranger maid whom catching greedily for great desire rend up her breast and bosom open laid in which that rose she plainly saw displayed then her embracing betwixt her arms twaine she long so held and softly weeping said and livest thou my daughter now again and art thou yet alive whom dead i long did feign tho further asking her of sundry things and times comparing with their accidents she found at last by very certain signs and speaking marks of passed monuments that this young maid whom chance to her presents is her own daughter her own infant deer tho wondering long at those so strange events a thousand times she her embraced never with many a joyful kiss and many a melting tear who ever is the mother of one child which having thought long dead she finds alive let her by proof of that which she hath filled in her own breast this mother's joy describe for other none such passion can contrive in perfect form as this good lady felt when she so fair a daughter saw survive as pastorella was that nigh she swelled for passing joy which did all into pity melt thence running forth unto her loved lord she unto him recounted all that fell who joining joy with her in one accord acknowledged for his own fair pastorell there leave we them in joy and let us tell of calidore who seeking all this while that monstrous beast by final force to quell through every place with restless pain and toil him followed by the tract of his outrageous spoil through all estates he found that he had passed in which he many massacres had left and to the clergy now was come at last in which such spoil such havoc and such theft he wrought that thence all goodness he bereft that endless were to tell the elfin knight who now no place beside unsought had left at length into a monastere did light where he him found despoiling all with main & might into their cloisters now he broken had through which the monks he chased here & there and them pursued into their dortours sad and searched all their cells and secrets near in which what filth and ordure did appear were irksome to report yet that foul beast nought sparing them the more did toss and tear and ransack all their dens from most to least regarding nought religion nor their holy hest from thence into the sacred church he broke and robbed the chancel and the desks down threw and altars fouled and blasphemy spoke and th'images for all their goodly hew did cast to ground whilst none was them to rew so all confounded and disordered there but seeing calidore away he flew knowing his fatal hand by former fear but he him fast pursuing soon approached near him in a narrow place he overtook and fierce assailing forced him turn again sternly he turned again when he him struck with his sharp steel and ran at him amain with open mouth that seemed to contain a full good peck within the utmost brim all set with iron teeth in ranges twaine that terrified his foes and armed him appearing like the mouth of orcus grisly grim and therein were a thousand tongue's empight of sundry kinds and sundry quality some were of dogs that barked day and night and some of cats that wrawling still did cry and some of bears that groined continually and some of tigers that did seem to grin and snare at all that ever passed by but most of them were tongues of mortal men which spoke reproachfully not caring where nor when and them among were mingled here and there the tongues of serpents with three forked stings that spat out poison and gore bloody gere at all that came within his ravenings and spoke licentious words and hateful things of good and bad alike of low and high ne kesars spared he a whit nor kings but either blotted them with infamy or bit them with his baneful teeth of injury but calidore thereof no whit afraid rencountered him with so impetuous might that outrage of his violence he stayed and bet aback threatening in vain to bite and spitting forth the poison of his spite that foamed all about his bloody jaws tho rearing up his former feet on hight he ramped upon him with his ravenous paws as if he would have rend him with his cruel claws but he right well aware his rage to ward did cast his shield atween and therewithal putting his puissance forth pursued so hard that backward he inforced him to fallen and being down ere he new help could call his shield he on him threw and fast down held like as a bullock that in bloody stall of butchers baleful hand to ground is felled is forcibly kept down till he be thoroughly quelled full cruelly the beast did rage and roar to be down held and mastered so with might that he gan fret and foam out bloody gore striving in vain to rear him self upright for still the more he strove the more the knight did him suppress and forcibly subdue that made him almost mad for fell despite he grind he bit he scratched he venom threw and fared like a fiend right horrible in hew or like the hellborn hydra which they feign that great alcides whilom overthrew after that he had laboured long in vain to crop his thousand heads the which still new forth budded and in greater number grew such was the fury of this hellish beast whilst calidore him under him down threw who nathemore his heavy load released but aye the more he raged the more his pour increased tho when the beast saw he mote nought avail by force he gan his hundred tongues apply and sharply at him to revile and rail with bitter terms of shameful infamy oft interlacing many a forged lie whose like he never once did speak nor hear nor ever thought thing so unworthily yet did he nought for all that him forbear but strained him so streightly that he choked him near at last when as he found his force to shrink and rage to quail he took a muzzle strong of surest iron made with many a link therewith he mured up his mouth along and therein shut up his blasphemous tonge for never more defaming gentle knight or unto lovely lady doing wrong and thereunto a great long chain he tied with which he drew him forth even in his own despite like as whilom that strong tirynthian swain brought forth with him the dreadful dog of hell against his will fast bound in iron chain and roaring horribly did him compel to see the hateful sun that he might tell to grisly pluto what on earth was done and to the other damned ghosts which dwell for aye in darkness which day light does shun so led this knight his captive with like conquest won yet greatly did the beast repine at those strange bans whose like till then he never boar ne ever any durst till then impose and chafed inly seeing now no more him liberty was left aloud to roar yet durst he not draw back nor once withstand the proved pour of noble calidore but trembled underneath his mighty hand and like a fearful dog him followed through the land him through all fairy land he followed so as if he learned had obedience long that all the people where so he did go out of their towns did round about him throng to see him lead that beast in bondage strong and seeing it much wondered at the sighed and all such persons as he erst did wrong rejoiced much to see his captive plighted and much admired the beast but more admired the knight thus was this monster by the mastering might of doughty calidore suppressed and tamed that never more he mote endamage wight with his vile tongue which many had defamed and many causeless caused to be blamed so did he eke long after this remain until that whither wicked fate so framed or fault of men he broke his iron chain and god into the world at liberty again thenceforth more mischief and more scathe he wrought to mortal men then he had done before ne ever could by any more be brought into like bans ne mastered any more albe that long time after calidore the good sir pelleas him took in hand and after him sir lamoracke of yore and all his brothers born in britaine land yet none of them could ever bring him into band so now he ranges through the world again and rages soar in each degree and state ne any is that may him now restrain he grown is so great and strong of late barking and biting all that him do bore albe they worthy blame or clear of crime ne spares he most learned wits to rate ne spares he the gentle poets rhyme but rends without regard of person or of time ne may this homely verse of many meanest hope to escape his venomous despite more then my former writs all were they clearest from blameful blot and free from all that wite with which some wicked tongues did it backbite and bring into a mighty peers displeasure that never so deserved to endite therefore do you my rhymes keep better measure and

finding that the same too much pleased those of like age & disposition which being too vehemently carried with that kind of affection do rather suck out poison to their strong passion then honey to their honest delight i was moved by the one of you two most excellent ladies to call in the same but being unable so to do by reason that many copies thereof were formerly scattered abroad i resolved at least to amend and by way of retractation to reform them making in stead of those two hymns of earthly or natural love and beauty two others of heavenly and celestial the which i do dedicate

threatening their own confusion and decay air hated earth and water hatefyre till love relented their rebellious ire he then them took and tempering goodly well their contrary dislikes with loved

kindly might so ever since they firmly have remained and duly well observed his behest through which now all these things that are contained within this goodly cope both most and lest their being have

seek only without further care to quench the flame which they in burning find but man that breathes a more immortal mind not for lustest sake but for eternity seeks to enlarge his lasting progeny for

vassal whose yet bleeding heart with thousand wounds thou mangled haste so soar that whole remains scarce any little part yet to augment the anguish of my smart thou hast enfrosen her disdainful breast that no one drop of pity there does rest why then do i this honour unto thee thus to ennoble thy victorious name since thou dost show no favour unto me ne once move ruth in that rebellious dame somewhat to slack the rigour of my flame certes small glory dost thou win hereby to let her live thus free and me to die but if thou be indeed as men thee call the world's great parent the most kind preserver of living wights the sovereign lord of all how falls it then that with thy furious fervour thou dost afflict as well the not deserver as him that doth thy lovely hests despise and on thy subjects most dost tyrannise yet herein eke thy glory seems more by so hard handling those which best thee serve that ere thou dost them unto grace restore thou mayest well try if they will ever swerve and mayest them make it better to deserve and bauing god it may it more esteem for things hard got men more dearly deem so hard those heavenly beauty's be enfyred as things divine least passion

his feeble earthly eyes endure the flaming light of that celestial fire which kindleth love in generous desire and makes him mount above the native might of heavy earth up to the heavens hight such is the pour of that sweet passion that it all sordid baseness does expel and the refined mind does newly fashion unto a fairer form which now does dwell in his high thought that would it self excel which he beholding still with constant sighed admires the mirror of so heavenly light whose image printing in his deepest wit he thereon feeds his hungry fantasy still full yet never satisfied with it like tantale that in store does steruedly so does he pine in most satiety for nought may quench his infinite desire once kindled through that first conceived fire thereon his mind affixed wholly is ne thinks on ought but how it to attain his care his joy his hope is all on this that seems in it all blisses to contain in sighed whereof all other bliss seems vain thrice happy man might he the same possess he feigns himself and does his fortune bless and though he do not win his wish to end yet thus far happy he him self does ween that heavens such happy grace did to him lend as thing on earth so heavenly to have seen his hearts enshrined saint his heavens queen fairer then fairest in his feigning eye whose sole aspect he counts felicity then forth he casts in his unquiet thought what he may do her favour to obtain what brave exploit what peril hardly wrought what puissant conquest what aduenturons pain may please her best and grace unto him gain he dreads no danger nor misfortune fears his faith his fortune in his breast he bears thou art his god thou art his mighty guide thou being blind lettest him not see his fears but carriest him to that which he hath eyed through seas

further on and strives still t'approch more near till in her inmost breast he may embosomd bee and loved best and yet not best but to be loved alone for love can not endure a paragon the fear whereof o how does it torment his troubled mind with more then hellish pain and to his feigning fausie represent sights never seen and thousand shadows vain to break his sleep and waste his idle brain thou that hast never loved canst not believe lest part of evils which poor lovers grieve the gnawing envy the heartfretting fear the vain surmizes the distrustful shows the false reports that flying tales do bear the doubts the dangers the delays the woes the feigned friends the unassured foes with thousands more then any tongue can tell do make a lovers life a wretches hell yet is there one more cursed then they all that cancer worm that monster jealousy which eats the heart and feeds upon the gall turning all loves delight to misery through fear of losing his felicity ah gods that ever you that monster placed in gentle love that all his joys defaced by these o love thou dost thy entrance make unto thy heaven and dost the more endear thy pleasures unto those which them partake as after storms when clouds begin to clear the sun more bright & glorious does appear so thou thy folk through pains of purgatory dost bear unto thy bliss and heavens glory there thou them placest in a paradise of all delight and joyous happy rest where they do feed on nectar heavenly wise with hercules and hebe and the rest of venus darlings through her bounty blessed and lie like gods in ivory beds arrayed with rose and lilies over them displayed there with thy daughter pleasure they do play their hurtless sports without rebuke or blame and in her snowy bosom boldly lay their quiet heads devoid of guilty shame after full joyance of their gentle game then her they crown their goddess and their queen and deck with flowers thy altars well beseen ay me deer lord that ever i might hope for all the pains and woes that i endure to come at length unto the wished scope of my desire or might my self assure that happy port for ever to recure then would i think these pains no pains at all and all my woes to be but penance small then would i sing of thine immortal praise and heavenly hymn such as the angels sing and thy triumphant name then would i raise above all the gods thee only honouring my guide my god my victor and my king till then dread lord vouchsafe to take of me this simple song thus framed in praise of thee finis and hymne in honovr of beavtie ah whither love wilt thou now carry me what wontless fury dost thou now inspire into my feeble breast too full of thee whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire thou in me kindlest much more great desire and up aloft above my strength dost raise the wondrous matter of my fire to praise that as i erst in praise of thine own name so now in honour of thy mother deer and honourable hymn i eke should frame and with the brightness of her beauty clear the ravished hearts of gazeful men might rear to admiration of that heavenly light from whence proceeds such foul enchanting might thereto do thou great goddess queen of beauty mother of love and of all world's delight without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sighed do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light tilluminate my dim and dulled eyes and beautify this sacred hymn of thine that both to thee to whom i mean it most and eke to her whose fair immortal beam hath darted fire into my feeble ghost that now it wasted is with woes extreme it may so please that she at length will stream some dew of grace into my withered heart after long sorrow and consuming smart what time this world's great workmaster did cast to make all things such as we now behold it seems that he before his eyes had placed a goodly pattern to whose perfect mould he fashioned them as comely as he could that now so fair and seemly they appear as nought may be amended any where that wondrous pattern wheresoever it be whither in earth laid up in secret store or else in heaven that no man may it see with sinful eyes for fear it to deflore is perfect beauty which all men adore whose face and feature does so much excel all mortal sense that none the same may tell thereof as every earthly thing partakes or more or less by influence divine so it more fair accordingly it makes and the gross matter of this earthly mine which clotheth it thereafter does refyne doing away the dross which dims the light of that fair beam which therein is empight for through infusion of celestial pour the duller earth it quickeneth with delight and life-full spirits privily does pour through all the parts that to the lookers sighed they seem to please that is thy sovereign might oh cyprian queen which flowing from the beam of thy bright star thou into them dost stream that is the thing which gives pleasant grace to all things fair that kindleth lively fire light of thy lamp which shining in the face thence to the soul darts amorous desire and robs the hearts of those which it admire therewith thou pointest thy sons poisoned arrow that wounds the life & wastes the inmost marrow how vainly then do idle wits invent that beauty is nought else but mixture made of colours fair and goodly temp'rament of pure complexions that shall quickly fade and pass away like to a summers shade or that it is but comely composition of parts well measured with meet disposition hath white and read in it such wondrous pour that it can pierce through eyes unto the heart and therein stir such rage and restless stour as nought but death can stint his dolours smart or can proportion of the outward part move such affection in the inward mind that it can rob both sense and reason blind why do not then the blossoms of the field which are arrayed with much more orient hew and to the sense most dainty odours yield work like impression in the lookers view or why do not fair pictures like pour show in which oftimes we nature see of art excelled in perfect limming every part but ah believe me there is more then so that works such wonders in the minds of men i that have often proved too well it know and who so list the like assays to ken shall find by trial and confess it then that beauty is not as found men misdeem and outward show of things that only seem for that same goodly hew of white and read with which the cheeks are sprinkled shall decay and those sweet rosy leaves so fairly spread upon the lips shall fade and fallen away to that they were even to corrupted clay that golden wire those sparkling stars so bright shall turn to dust and lose their goodly light but that fair lamp from whose celestial ray that light proceeds which kindleth lovers fire shall never be extinguished nor decay but when the vital spirits do expire unto her native planet shall retire for it is heavenly born and can not die being a parcel of the purest sky for when the soul the which derived was at first out of that great immortal spright by whom all live to love whilom did pass down from the top of purest heavens hight to be embodied here it then took light and lively spirits from that fairest star which lights the world forth from his firy car which pour retaining still or more or less when she in fleshly seed is est enraced through every part she does thee same impress according as the heavens have her graced and frames her house in which she will be placed fit for her self adorning it with spoil of heavenly riches which she robderewhyle thereof it comes that these fair souls which have the most resemblance of that heavenly light frame to themselves most beautiful and brave their fleshly bower most fit for their delight and the gross matter by a sovereign might tempers so trim that it may well be seen a palace fit for such a virgin queen so every spirit as it is most pure and hath in it the more of heavenly light so it the fairer body does procure to habit in and it more fairly dight with cheerful grace and amiable sighed for of the soul the body form does take for soul is form and does the body make therefore where ever that thou dost behold a comely corpse with beauty fair endued know this for certain that the same does hold a beauteous soul with fair conditions thewed fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed for all that fair is is by nature good that is a sign to know the gentle blood yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind dwells in deformed tabernacle drowned either by chance against the course of kind or through unaptness in the substance found which it assumed of some stubborn ground that will not yield unto her forms direction but is performed with some foul imperfection and oft it falls ay me the more to rew that goodly beauty albe heavenly born is foul abused and that celestial hew which does the world with her delight adorn made but the bait of sin and sinners scorn whilst every one does seek and sew to have it but every one does seek but to deprave it yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame but theirs that do abuse it unto ill nothing so good but that through guilty shame may be corrupt and wrested unto will natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still how ever fleshes fault it filthy make for things immortal no corruption take but you fair dams the world's deer ornaments and lively images of heavens light let not your beams with such disparagements be dimmed and your bright glory darkened quite but mindful still of your first countries sighed do still preserve your first informed grace whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face loath that foul blot that hellish fierbrand disloyal lust fair beauty's foulest blame that base affections which your ears would bland commend to you by loves abused name but is indeed the bondslave of defame which will the garland of your glory mar and quench the light of your bright shining star but gentle love that loyal is and true will more illumine your resplendent ray and add more brightness to your goodly hew from light of his pure fire which by like way kindled of yours your likeness does display like as two mirrors by opposed reflection do both express the faces first impression therefore to make your beauty more appear it you behooves to love and forth to lay that heavenly riches which in you you bear that men the more admire their fountain may for else what boots that celestial ray if it in darkness be enshrined ever that it of loving eyes be viewed never but in your choice of loves this well advise that likest to your selves you them select the which your forms first source may sympathise and with like beauty's parts be inly decked for if you loosely love without respect it is no love but a discordant war whose unlike parts among themselves do jar for love is a celestial harmony of likely hearts composed of stars concent which join together in sweet sympathy to work each others joy and true content which they have harboured since their first descent out of their heavenly bowers where they did see and know each other here beloved to be then wrong it were that any other twaine should in loves gentle band combined be but those whom heaven did at first ordain and made out of one mould the more agree for all that like the beauty which they see straight do not love for love is not so light as straight to burn at first beholders sighed but they which love indeed look otherwise with pure regard and spotless true intent drawing out of the object of their eyes a more refined form which they present unto their mind void of all blemishment which it reducing to her first perfection beholdeth free from fleshes frail infection and then conforming it unto the light which in it self it hath remaining still of that first sun yet sparkling in his sighed thereof he fashions in his higher skill and heavenly beauty to his fancies will and it embracing in his mind entire the mirror of his own thought does admire which seeing now so inly fair to be as outward it appears to the eye and with his spirits proportion to agree he thereon fixeth all his fantasy and fully sets his felicity counting it fairer then it is indeed and yet indeed her fairness does exceed for lovers eyes more sharply sighted be then other men's and in deer loves delight see more then any other eyes can see through mutual receipt of beams bright which carry privy message to the spright and to their eyes that inmost fair display as plain as light discovers dawning day therein they see through amorous eye-glaunces armies of loves still flying too and from which dart at them their little fiery lances whom having wounded back again they go carrying compassion to their lovely foe who seeing her fair eyes so sharp effect cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect in which how many wonders do they reed to their conceit that others never see now of her smiles with which their souls they feed like gods with nectar in their banquets free now of her looks which like to cordials be but when her words embassade forth she sends lord how sweet music that unto them lends sometime upon her forehead they behold a thousand graces masking in delight sometime within her eyelids they unfold ten thousand sweet belgard's which to their sighed do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night but on her lips like rosy buds in may so many millions of chaste pleasures play all those o cytherea and thousands more thy handmaidens be which do on thee attend to deck thy beauty with their dainties store that may it more to mortal eyes commend and make it more admired of foe and friend that in men's hearts thou mayest thy throne enstall and spread thy lovely kingdom over all then iotryumph o great beauty's queen advance the banner of thy conquest high that all this world the which thy vassals been may draw to thee and with due fealty adore the pour of thy great majesty singing this hymn in honour of thy name compiled by me which thy poor liegeman am in lieu whereof grant o great sovereign that she whose conquering beauty does captive my trembling heart in her eternal chain one drop of grace at length will to me give that i her bounden thrall by her may live and this same life which first from me she reaved may owe to her of whom i it received and you fair venus darling my deer dread fresh flower of grace great goddess of my life when your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read deign to let fallen one drop of due relief that may recure my hearts long pining grief and show what wondrous pour your beauty hath that can restore a damned wight from death finis and hymne of heavenly love loue lift me up upon thy golden wings from this base world unto thy heavens hight where i may see those admirable things which there thou workest by thy sovereign might far above feeble reach of earthly sighed that i thereof and heavenly hymn may sing unto the god of love high heavens king many lewd lays ah woe is me the more in praise of that mad fit which fools call love i have in th'heat of youth made heretofore that in light wits did lose affection move but all those follies now i do reprove and turned have the tenor of my string the heavenly praises of true love to sing and you that wont with greedy vain desire to read my fault and wondering at my flame to warm your selves at my wide sparkling fire sith now that heat is quenched quench my blame and in her ashes shroud my dying shame for who my passed follies now pursues begins his own and my old fault renews before this world's great frame in which all things are now contained found any being place ere flitting time could wag his eyas wings about that mighty bound which does embrace the rolling spheres & parts their hours by space that high eternal pour which now does move in all these things moved in it self by love it loved it self because it self was fair for fair is loved and of it self begotten like to it self his eldest son and heir eternal pure and void of sinful blot the firstling of his joy in whom no jot of loves dislike or pride was to be found whom he therefore with equal honour crowned with him he reigned before all time prescribed in endless glory and immortal might together with that third from them derived most wise most holy most almighty spright whose kingdoms throne no thought of earthly wight can comprehend much less my trembling verse with equal words can hope it to rehearse yet o most blessed spirit pure lamp of light eternal spring of grace and wisdom true vouchsafe to shed into my barren spright some little drop of thy celestial due that may my rhymes with sweet infuse embrew and give me words equal unto my thought to tell the marvels by thy mercy wrought yet being pregnant still with powerful grace and full of fruitful love that loves to get things like himself and to enlarge his raze his second brood though not in pour so great yet full of beauty next he did beget and infinite increase of angels bright all glistering glorious in their makers light to them the heavens illimitable hight not this round heaven which we from hence behold adorned with thousand lamps of burning light and with ten thousand gems of shining gold he gave as their inheritance to hold that they might serve him in eternal bliss and be partakers of those joys of his there they in their trinal triplicities about him wait and on his will depend either with nimble wings to cut the skies when he them on his messages does send or on his own dread presence to attend where they behold the glory of his light and carol hymns of love both day and night both day and night is unto them all one for he his beams does still to them extend that darkness there appears never none ne hath their day ne hath their bliss and end but there their termelesse time in pleasure spend ne ever should their happiness decay had not they dared their lord to disobey but pride impatient of long resting peace did puff them up with greedy bold ambition that they gan cast their state how to increase above the fortune of their first condition and fit in gods own seat without commission the brightest angel even the child of light drew millions more against their god to fight th'almighty seeing their so bold assay kindled the flame of his consuming ire and with his only breath them blew away from heavens hight to which they did aspire to deepest hell and lake of damned fire where they in darkness and dread horror dwell hating the happy light from which they fell so that next offspring of the makers love next to himself in glorious degree degendering to hate fell from above through pride for pride and love may ill agree and now of sin to all ensample be how then can sinful flesh it self assure sith purest angels fell to be impure but that eternal fount of love and grace still flowing forth his goodness unto all now seeing left a waste and empty place in his wide palace through those angels fallen cast to supply the same and to enstall a new unknown colony therein whose root from earth's base groundwork should begin therefore of clay base vile and next to nought yet formed by wondrous skill and by his might according to and heavenly pattern wrought which he had fashioned in his wise foresight he man did make and breathed a living spright into his face most beautiful and fair endued with wifedomes riches heavenly rare such he him made that he resemble might himself as mortal thing immortal could him to be lord of every living wight he made by love out of his own like mould in whom he might his mighty self behold for love does love the thing beloved to see that like it self in lovely shape may be but man forgetful of his makers grace no less then angels whom he did ensue fell from the hope of promised heavenly place into the mouth of death to sinners due and all his offspring into thraldom threw where they for ever should in bonds remain of never dead yet ever dying pain till that great lord of love which him at first made of mere love and after liked well seeing him lie like creature long accursed in that deep horror of despair hell him wretch in dole would let no longer dwell but cast out of that bondage to redeem and pay the price all were his debt extreme out of the bosom of eternal bliss in which he reigned with his glorious sire he down descended like a most demisse and abject thrall in fleshes frail attire that he for him might pay sins deadly hire and him restore unto that happy state in which he stood before his hapless fate in flesh at first the guilt committed was therefore in flesh it must be satisfied nor spirit nor angel though they man surpass could make amends to god for men misguide but only man himself who self did slide so taking flesh of sacred virgins womb for men deer sake he did a man become and that most blessed body which was born without all blemish or reproachful blame he freely gave to be both rend and torn of cruel hands who with despiteful shame reuyling him that them most vile became at length him nailed on a gallow tree and slew the just by most unjust decree o huge and most unspeakable impression of loves deep wound that pierced the piteous heart of that deer lord with so entire affection and sharply launching every inner part dolours of death into his soul did dart doing him die that never it deserved to free his foes that from his hest had swerved what heart can feel least touch of so soar launch or thought can think the depth of so deer wound whose bleeding source their streams yet never staunch but still do flow & freshly still redound to heal the sores of sinful souls unsound and cleanse the guilt of that infected crime which was enrooted in all fleshly slime o blessed well of love o flower of grace oh glorious morning star o lamp of light most lively image of thy father's face eternal king of glory lord of might meek lamb of god before all world's behight how can we thee requite for all this good or what can prize that thy most precious blood yet nought thou askest in lieu of all this love but love of us for guerdon of thy pain ay me what can us less then that behone had he required life of us again had it been wrong to ask his own with gain he gave us life he it restored lost then life were least that us so little cost but he our life hath left unto us free free that was thrall and blessed that was band ne ought demands but that we loving bee as he himself hath loved us afore hand and bound thereto with and eternal band him first to love that us so dearly bought and next our brothers to his image wrought him first to love great right and reason is who first to us our life and being gave and after when we fared had amiss us wretches from the second death did save and last the food of life which now we have even himself in his deer sacrament to feed our hungry souls unto us lent then next to love our brothers that were made of that self mould and that self makers hand that we and to the same again shall fade where they shall have like heritage of land how ever here on higher steps we stand which also were with self same price redeemed that we how ever of us light esteemed and were they not yet since that loving lord commanded us to love them for his sake even for his sake and for his sacred word which in his last bequest he to us spoke we should them love & with their needs partake knowing that whatsoever to them we give we give to him by whom we all do live such mercy he by his most holy reed unto us taught and to approve it true ensampled it by his most righteous deed showing us mercy miserable crew that we the like should to the wretches show and love our brothers thereby to approve how much himself that loved us we love then rouse thy self o earth out of thy soil in which thou wallowest like to filthy swine and dost thy mind in dirty pleasures moil unmindful of that dearest lord of thine lift up to him thy heavy clouded eyes that thou his sovereign bounty mayest behold and read through love his mercies manifold begin from first where he encradled was in simple cratch wrapped in a would of hay between the toylefull ox and humble ass and in what rags and in how base array the glory of our heavenly riches lay when him the silly shepherds came to see whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee from thence read on the story of his life his humble carriage his unfaulty ways his cankered foes his fights his toil his strife his pains his poverty his sharp assays through which he passed his miserable days offending none and doing good to all yet being malist both of great and small and look at last how of most wretched wights he taken was betrayed and false accused how with most scornful taunts & fell despites bruised he was reviled disgraced and foul abused how scourged how crowned how buffeted how & side and lastly how betwixt robbers crucifyde with bitter wounds through hands through feet then let thy flinty heart that feels no pain empierced be with pitiful remorse and let thy bowels bleed in every vain at sighed of his most sacred heavenly corpse so torn and mangled with malicious force and let thy soul whose sins his sorrows wrought melt into tears and groan in grieved thought with sense whereof whilst so thy softened spirit is inly touched and humbled with meek zeal through meditation of his endless merit lift up thy mind to author of thy weal and to his sovereign mercy do appeal learn him to love that loved thee so deer and in thy breast his blessed image bear with all thy heart with all thy soul and mind thou must him love and his behests embrace all other loves with which the world does blind weak fancies and stir up affections base thou must renounce and utterly displace and give thy self unto him full and free that full and freely gave himself to thee then shalt thou feel thy spirit so possessed and ravished with devouring great desire of his deer self that shall thy feeble breast inflame with love and set thee all on fire with burning zeal through every part entire that in no earthly thing thou shalt delight but in his sweet and amiable sighed thenceforth all world's desire will in thee die and all earth's glory on which men do gaze seem dirt and dross in thy pure sighted eye compared to that celestial beauty's blaze whose glorious beams all fleshly sense does daze with admiration of their passing light blinding the eyes and lumining the spright then shall thy ravished soul inspired be with heavenly thoughts far above humane skill and thy bright radiant eyes shall plainly see th'idee of his pure glory present still before thy face that all thy spirits shall fill with sweet enragement of celestial love kindled through sighed of those fair things above finis and hymne of heavenly beavtie rapt with the rage of mine own ravished thought through contemplation of those goodly sights and glorious images in heaven wrought whose wondrous beauty breathing sweet delights do kindle love in high conceited sprights i feign to tell the things that i behold but feel my wits to fail and tongue to fold vouchsafe then o thou most almighty spright from whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow to shed into my breast some sparkling light of thine eternal truth that i may show some little beams to mortal eyes below of that immortal beauty there with thee which in my weak distraughted mind i see that with the glory of so goodly sighed the hearts of men which fondly here admire fair seeming shows and feed on vain delight transported with celestial desire of those fair forms may lift themselves up high and learn to love with zealous humble duty th'eternall fountain of that heavenly beauty beginning then below with th'easie view of this base world subiectro fleshly eye from thence to mount aloft by order due to contemplation of th'immortall sky of the soar falcon so i learn to fly that flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath till she her self for stronger flight can breath then look who list thy gazeful eyes to feed with sighed of that is fair look on the frame of this wide universe and therein reed the endless kinds of creatures which by name thou canst not count much less their nature's aim all which are made with wondrous wise respect and all with admirable beauty decked first earth on adamantine pillars founded amid the sea engirded with brazen bans then th'aire still flitting but yet firmly bounded on every side with piles of flaming brands never consumed nor quenched with mortal hands and last that mighty shining crystal wall wherewith he hath encompassed this all. by view whereof it plainly may appear that still as every thing does upward tend and further is from earth so still more clear and fair it grows till to his perfect end of purest beauty it at last ascend air more then water fire much more then air and heaven then fire appears more pure & fair look thou no further but affix thine eye on that bright shiny round still moving mass the house of blessed gods which men call sky all sowd with glistering stars more thick them grass whereof each other does in brightness pass but those two most which ruling night and day as king and queen the heavens empire sway and tell me then what hast thou ever seen that to their beauty may compared be or can the sighed that is most sharp and keen endure their captains flaming head to see how much less those much higher in degree and so much fairer and much more then these as these are fairer then the land and seas for far above these heavens which here we see be others far exceeding these in light not bounded not corrupt as these same be but infinite in largeness and in hight unmoving uncorrupt and spotless bright that need no sun t'illuminate their spheres but their own native light far passing theirs and as these heavens still by degrees arise until they come to their first movers bound that in his mighty compass does comprise and carry all the rest with him around so those likewise do by degrees redound and rise more fair till they at last arrive to the most fair whereto they all do strive fair is the heaven where happy souls have place in full enjoyment of felicity whence they do still behold the glorious face of the divine eternal majesty more fair is that where those idees on high enranged be which plato so admired and pure intelligences from god inspired yet fairer is that heaven in w hich do rain the sovereign powers and mighty potentates which in their high protections do contain all mortal princes and imperial states and fairer yet whereas the royal seats and heavenly dominations are set from whom all earthly governance is fetched yet far more fair be those bright cherubins which all with golden wings are overdight and those eternal burning seraphins which from their faces dart out fiery light yet fairer then they both and much more bright be th'angels and archangels which attend on gods own person without rest or end these thus in fair each other far excelling as to the highest they approach more near yet is that highest far beyond all telling fairer then all the rest which there appear though all their beauty's joined together were how then can mortal tongue hope to express the image of such endless perfectness cease then my tongue and lend unto my mind leave to bethink how great that beauty is whose utmost parts so beautiful i find how much more those essential parts of his his truth his love his wisdom and his bliss his grace his doom his mercy and his might by which he lends us of himself a sighed those unto all he daily does display and show himself in th'image of his grace as in a looking glass through which he may be seen of all his creatures vile and base that are unable else to see his face his glorious face which glistereth else so bright that th'angels selves can not endure his sighed but we frail wights whose sighed cannot sustain the suns bright beams when he on us does shine but that their points rebutted back again are dulled how can we see with feeble eyes the glory of that majesty divine in sighed of whom both sun and moon are dark compared to his least resplendent spark the means therefore which unto us is lent him to behold is on his works to look which he hath made in beauty excellent and in the same as in a brazen book to read enregistered in every nook his goodness which his beauty does declare for all thats good is beautiful and fair thenee gathering plumes of perfect speculation to imp the wings of thy high flying mind mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation from this dark world whose damps the soul do blind and like the native brood of eagles kind on that bright sun of glory fix thine eyes cleared from gross mists of frail infirmities humbled with fear and awful reverence before the footstool of his majesty throw thy self down with trembling innocence ne dare look up with corruptible eye on the dreaded face of that great deity for fear lest if he chance to look on thee thou turn to nought and quite confounded be but lowly fallen before his mercy seat close covered with the lambs integrity from the iustwrath of his avengeful threat that sits upon the righteous throne on high his throne is built upon eternity more firm and durable then steel or brass or the hard diamond which them both does pass his sceptre is the rod of righteousness with which he bruiseth all his foes to dust and the great dragon strongly does repress under the rigour of his judgement just his seat is truth to which the faithful trust from whence proceed her beams so pure & bright that all about him sheds glorious light light far exceeding that bright blazing spark which darted is from titans flaming head that with his beams enlumineth the dark the dark & dampish air whereby all things are read whose nature yet so much is marveled of mortal wits that it does much amaze the greatest wizards which thereon do gaze but that immortal light which there does shine is many thousand times more clear more excellent more glorious more divine through which to god all mortal actions here and even the thoughts of men do plain appear for from th'eternall truth it does proceed through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed with the great glory of that wondrous light his throne is all encompassed around and hid in his own brightness from the sighed of all that look thereon with eyes unsound and underneath his feet are to be found thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire the instruments of his avenging ire there in his bosom sapience does fit the sovereign darling of the deity clad like a queen in royal robes most fit for so great pour and peerless majesty and all with gems and jewels gorgeously adorned that brighter then the stars appear and make her native brightness seem more clear and on her head a crown of purest gold is set in sign of highest sovereignty and in her hand a sceptre she does hold with which she rules the house of god on high and menageth the ever-moving sky and in the same these lower creatures all subjected to her pour imperial both he aven and earth obey unto her will and all the creatures which they both contain for of her fullness which the world does fill they all partake and do in state remain as their great maker did at first ordain through observation of her high behest by which they first were made and still increased the fairness of her face no tongue can tell for she the daughters of all women's raze and angels eke in beauty does excel sparkled on her from gods own glorious face and more increased by her own goodly grace that it does far exceed all humane thought ne can on earth compared be to ought ne could that painter had he lived yet which pictured venus with so curious quill that all posterity admired it have portrayed this for all his mastering skill ne she her self had she remained still and were as fair as fabling wits do fain could once come near this beauty sovereign but had those wits the wonders of their days or that sweet teian poet which did spend his plenteous vain in setting forth her praise seen but a glims of this which i pretend how wondrously would he her face commend above that idol of his feigning thought that all the world should with his rhymes be fraught how then dare i the novice of his art presume to picture so divine a wight or hope express her least perfections part whose beauty fills the heavens with her light and darks the earth with shadow of her sighed ah gentle muse thou art too weak and faint the portrait of so heavenly hew to paint let angels which her goodly face behold and see at will her sovereign praises sing and those most facred mysteries unfold of that fair love of mighty heavens king enough is me admire so heavenly thing and being thus with her huge love possessed in only wonder of her self to rest but who so may thrice happy man him hold of all on earth whom god so much does grace and lets his own beloved to behold for in the view of her celestial face all joy all bliss all happiness have place ne ought on earth can want unto the wight who of her self can win the wishful sighed for she out of her secret treasury plenty of riches forth on him will pour even heavenly riches which there hidden lie within the closet of her chastest bower th'eternall portion of her precious dowry which mighty god hath given to her free and to all those which thereof worthy be none thereof worthy be but those whom she vouchsafeth to her presence to receive and lets them her lovely face to see whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive and sweet contentment that it does bereave their soul of sense through infinite delight and them transport from flesh into the spright in which they see such admirable things as carries them into and ecstasy and hear such heavenly notes and carolings of gods high praise that fills the brazen sky and feel such joy and pleasure inwardly that makes them all worldly cares forget and only think on that before them set ne from thenceforth does any fleshly sense or idle thought of earthly things remain but all that erst seemed sweet seems now offence and all that pleased erst now seems to pain their joy their comfort their desire their gain is fixed all on that which now they see all other sights but feigned shadows be and that fair lamp which uses to inflame the hearts of men with self consuming fire thenceforth seems fowl & full of sinful blame and all that pomp to which proud minds aspire by name of honour and so much desire seems to them baseness and all riches dross and all mirth sadness and all lucre loss so full their eyes are of that glorious sighed and senses fraught with such satiety that in nought else on earth they can delight but in th'aspect of that felicity which they have written in their inward ey on which they feed and in their fastened mind all happy joy and full contentment find ah then my hungry soul which long hast fed on idle fancies of thy foolish thought and with false beauty's flattering bait misled hast after vain deceitful shadows sought which all are fled and now have left thee nought but late repentance through thy follies brief ah cease to gaze no matter of thy grief and look at last up to that sovereign light from whose pure beams alperfect beauty springs that kindleth love in every godly spright even the love of god which loathing brings of this vile world and these gay seeming things with whose sweet pleasures being so possessed thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest daphnaida and elegie upon the death of the noble and vertvovs dovglas howard daughter and heir of henry lord howard viscount byndon and wife of arthur gorges esquire dedicated to the right honourable the lady helena marquess of northampton by ed. sp. anchora spei at london printed for william ponsonby 1596. to the right honourable and virtuous lady helena marquess of northampton i have the rather presumed humbly to offer unto your honour the dedication of this little poëme for that the noble and virtuous gentlewoman of whom it is written was by match near allied and in affection greatly devoted unto your ladyship the occasion why i wrote the same was aswell the great good fame which i herd of her deceased as the particular good will which i bear unto her husband master arthur gorges a lover of learning and virtue whose house as your ladyship by marriage hath honoured so do i find the name of them by many notable records to be of great antiquity in this realm and such as have ever born themselves with honoarable reputation to the world & unspotted loyalty to their prince and country beside so lineally are they descended from the howards as that the lady anne howard eldest daughter to iohn duke of norfolke was wife to sir edmund mother to sir edward and grandmother to sir william and sir thomas gorges knights and therefore i do assure my self that no due honour done to the white lion but will be most grateful to your ladyship whose husband and children do so nearly participate with the blood of that noble family so in all duty i recommend this pamphlet and the good acceptance thereof to your honourable favour and protection london this first of ianuarie 1591. your honours humbly ever ed. sp. daphnaida what ever man he be whose heavy mind with grief of mournful great mishap oppressed fit matter for his cares increase would find let read the rueful plaint herein expressed of one i ween the wofulst man alive even sad alcyon whose empierced breast sharp sorrow did in thousand pieces rive but who so else in pleasure finds sense or in this wretched life doth take delight let him be banished far away from hence ne let the sacred sisters here be hight though they of sorrow heavily can sing for even their heavy song would breed delight but here no tunes save sobs and groans shall ring in stead of them and their sweet harmony let those three fatal sisters whose sad bans do weave the direful threads of destiny and in their wrath break off the vital bans approach hereto and let the dreadful queen of darkness deep come from the stygian strands and grisly ghosts to hear this doleful teen in gloomy evening when the weary sun after his days long labour drew to rest and sweaty steeds now having over run the compassed sky gan water in the west i walked abroad to breath the freshing air in open fields whose flowering pride oppressed with early frosts had lost their beauty fair there came unto my mind a troublous thought which daily does my weaker wit possess ne lets it rest until it forth have brought her long born infant fruit of heaviness which she conceived hath through meditation of this world's vainness and life's wretchedness that yet my soul it deeply does empassion so as i mused on the misery in which men live and i of many most most miserable man i did espy where towards me a sorry wight did cost clad all in black that mourning did bewray and iaakob staff in hand devoutly crossed like to some pilgrim come from far away his careless locks uncombed and unshorn hung long adown and beard all over grown that well he seemed to be some wight forlorn down to the earth his heavy eyes were thrown as loathing light and ever as he went he sighed soft and inly deep did groan as if his heart in pieces would have rend approaching nigh his face i viewed never and by the semblant of his countenance me seemed i had his person seen else where most like alcyon seeming at a glance alcyon he the jolly shepherd swain that wont full merrily to pipe and dance and fill with pleasance every wood and plain yet half in doubt because of his disguise i softly said alcyon there withal he looked a side as in disdainful wise yet stayed not till i again did call then turning back he said with hollow found who is it that doth name me woeful thrall the wretchedest man that treads this day on ground one whom like wofulnesse impressed deep hath made fit mate thy wretched case to hear and given like cause with thee to wail and weep grief finds some ease by him that like does bear then stay alcyon gentle shepherd stay quoth i till thou have to my trusty care committed what thee doth so ill apay cease foolish man said he half wrothfully to seek to hear that which cannot be told for the huge anguish which doth multiply my dying pains no tongue can well unfold ne do i care that any should bemoan my hard mishap or any weep that would but seek alone to weep and die alone then be it so quoth i that thou art bent to die alone unpitied unplained yet ere thou die it were convenient to tell the cause which thee thereto constrained lest that the world thee dead accuse of guilt and say when thou of none shalt be maintained that thou for secret crime thy blood hast spilled who life does loath and longs to be unbound from the strong shackles of frail flesh quoth he nought cares at all what they that live on ground deem the occasion of his death to be rather desires to be forgotten quite than question made of his calamity for hearts deep sorrow hates both life and light yet since so much thou seemest to rue my grief and carest for one that for himself cares nought sign of thy love though nought for my relief for my relief exceeds living thought i will to thee this heavy case relate then harken well till it to end be brought for never didst thou hear more hapless fate whilom ivsde as thou right well dost know my little flock on western downs to keep not far from whence sabrinaes stream does flow and flowery banks with silver liquour steep nought card i then for worldly change or chance for all my joy was on my gentle sheep and to my pipe to carol and to dance it there befell as i the fields did range fearless and free a fair young lioness white as the native rose before the change which venus blood did in her leaves impress i spied playing on the grassy plain her youthful sports and kindly wantonness that did all other beasts in beauty stain much was i moved at so goodly sighed whose like before mine eye had seldom seen and gan to cast how i her compass might and bring to hand that yet had never been so well i wrought with mildness and with pain that i her caught disporting on the green and brought away fast bound with silver chain and afterwards i handled her so sayre that though by kind she stout and salvage were for being born and ancient lions hair and of the raze that all wild beasts do fear yet i her framed and wanso to my bent that she became so meek and mild of cheer as the least lamb in all my flock that went for she in field where ever i did weened would weened with me and wait by me all day and all the night that i in watch did spend if cause required or else in sleep if nay she would all night by me or watch or sleep and evermore when i did sleep or play she of my flock would take full wary keep safe then and safest were my filly she epe ne feared the wolf ne feared the wildest beast all were i drowned in carelessequiet deep my loucly lionosse without behest so careful was for them and for my good thta when i waked neither most nor lest i found miscarried or in plain or wood oft did the shepheatils which my hap did hear and oft their lasses which my lack envied daily resort to my from far and near to see my lioness whose prailes wide where spread abroad and when her worthiness much greater than the rude report they tried they her did praise and my good fortune bless long thus lioyed in my happiness and well did hope my joy would have no end but o found man that in world's fickleness reposedst hope or weenedest her thy friend that glories most in mortal misery's and daily does her changeful counfels bend to make new matter fit for tragedies for whilst i was thus without dread or doubt a cruel satire with his murderous dart greedy of mischief ranging all about gave her the fatal wound of deadly smart and reft from me my sweet companion and reft from me my love my life my heart my lioness and woe is me is gone out of the world thus was she reft away out of the world unworthy such a spoil and born to heaven for he aven a fitter pray much fitter than the lion which with toil alcides slew and fixed in firmament her now i seek throughout this earthly soil and seeking miss and missing do lament therewith he gan afresh to wail and weep that i for pity of his heavy plighted could not abstain mine eyes with tears to steep but when i saw the anguish of his spright some deal alaid i him bespoke again certes alcyon painful is thy plighted that it in me breeds almost equal pain yet does not my dull wit well understand the riddle of thy loved lioness for rare it seems in reason to be skand that man who does the whole world's rule possess should to a beast his noble heart embase and be the vassal of his vassalesse therefore more plain aread this doubtful case then sighing soar daphne thou knewest quoth he she now is dead ne more endured to say but fell to ground for great extremity that i beholding it with deep dismay was much paid and lightly him uprearing revoked life that would have fled away all were my self through grief in deadly drearing then gan i him to comfort all my best and with mild counsel strove to mitigate the stormy passion of his troubled breast but he thereby was more empassionate as stubborn steed that is with curb restrained becomes more fierce and fervent in his gate and breaking forth at last thus dearnely plained 1 what man henceforth that breathes vital air will honour heaven or heavenly powers adore which so unjustly do their judgements share amongst earthly wights as to afflict so soar the innocent as those which do transgress and do not spare the best or fairest more than worst or foulest but do both oppress if this be right why did they then create the world so fair sith fairness is neglected or why be they themselves immaculate if purest things be not by them respected she fair she pure most fair most pure she was yet was by them as thing impure rejected yet she in pureness heaven it self did pass in pureness and in all celestial grace that men admire in goodly womankind she did excel and seemed of angels raze living on earth like angel new diuinde adorned with wisdom and with chastity and all the dowries of a noble mind which did her beauty much more beautify no age hath bred since fair astraea left the sinful world more virtue in a wight and when she parted hence with her she reft great hope and robbed her raze of bounty quite well may the shepherd lasses now lament for double loss by her hath on them light to lose both her and bounties omament ne let elisa royal shepherdess the praises of my parted love envy for she hath praises in all plenteousness poured upon her like showers of castaly by her own shepherd colin her own shepherd that her with heavenly hymns does deify of rustic muse full hardly to be bettered she is the rose the glory of the day and mine the primrose in the lowly shade mine ah not mine amiss i mine did say not mine but his which mine a while her made mine to be his with him to live for ay oh that so fair a flower so soon should fade and through untimely tempest fallen away she fell away in her first ages spring while yet her leaf was green & fresh her rind and while her branch fair blossoms forth did bring she fell away against all course of kind for age to die is right but youth is wrong she fell away like fruit blown down with wind weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 2 what heart so stony hard but that would weep and pour forth fountains of incessant tears what timon but would let compassion creep into his breast and pierce his frozen ears in stead of tears whose brackish bitter well i wasted have my heart blood dropping wears to think to ground how that fair blossom fell yet fell she not as one inforced to die ne died with dread and grudging discontent but as one toiled with travel down does lie so lay she down as if to fleepe she went and closed her eyes with careless quiemesse the while soft death away her spirit hent and soul assoiled from sinful fleshliness yet ere that life her lodging did forsake she all resolved and ready to remone calling to me ay me this wise bespoke alcyon ah my first and latest lone ah why does my alcyon weep and mourn and grieve my ghost that ill more him behoove as if to me had chanced some evil turn i since the messenger is come for me that summons souls unto the bridal feast of his great lord must needs depart from thee and straight obey his soneraine behest why should alcyon then so soar lament that i from misery shall be released and freed from wretched long imprisonment our days are full of dolour and disease our life afflicted with incessant pain that nought on earth may lessen or appease why then should i desire here to remain or why should he that loves me sorry bee for my deliverance or at all complain my good to hear and towards joys to see i go and long desired have to go i go with gladness to my wished rest whereas no world's sad care nor wasting woe may come their happy quiet to molest but saints and angels in celestial thrones eternally him praise that hath them blessed there shall i be among those blessed ones yet ere i go a pledge i leave with thee of the late love the which betwixt us passed my young ambrosia in lieu of me love her so shall our love for ever last thus deer adieu whom i expect ere long so having said away she softly passed weep shepherd weep to make mine undersong 3 so oft as i record those piercing words which yet are deep engraved in my breast and those last deadly accents which like swords did wound my heart and rend my bleeding chest with those sweet sugared speeches do compare the which my soul first conquered and possessed the first beginners of my endless care and when those pallid cheeks and ashy hew in which sad death his portraiture had writ and when those hollow eyes and deadly view on which the cloud of ghastly night did fit i match with that sweet smile and cheerful brow which all the world subdued unto it how happy was i then and wretched now how happy was i when i saw her lead the shepherds daughters dancing in around how trimly would she trace and softly tread the tender grass with rosy garland crowned and when she list advance her heavenly voice both nymphs & muses nigh she made astounded and flocks and shepherds caused to rejoice but now you shepherd lasses who shall led your wandering troops or sing your virelays or who shall dight your bowers sith she is dead that was the lady of your holy days let now your bliss be turned into bale and into plaints convert your joyous plays and with the same fill every hill and dale let bagpipe never more be herd to shrill that may allure the senses to delight ne ever shepherd found his oaten quill unto the many that provoke them might to idle pleasance but let ghastliness and dreary horror dim the cheerful light to make the image of true heaviness let birds be silent on the naked spray and shady woods resound with dreadful yells let streaming floods their hasty courses stay and parching drouth dry up the crystal wells let earth be barren and bring forth no flowers and the be filled with noise of doleful knells and wandering spirits walk untimely hours and nature nurse of every living thing let rest her self from her long weariness and cease henceforth things kindly forth to bring but hideous monsters full of ugliness for she it is that hath me done this wrong no nurse but stepdame cruel merciless weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 4 my little flock whom erst i loved so well and wont to feed with finest grass that grew feed you henceforth on bitter astrofell and stinking smallage and unsavoury rew and when your maws are with those weeds corrupted be you the prey of wolves ne will i rew that with your carcases wild beasts be glutted ne worse to you my silly sheep i pray ne sorer vengeance wish on you to fallen than to my self for whose confused decay to careless heavens i do daily call but heavens refuse to hear a wretches cry and cruel death does scorn to come at call or grant his boon that most desires to die the good and righteous he away does take to plague unrighteous which alive remain but the ungodly ones he does forsake by living long to multiply their pain else surely death should be no punishment as the great judge at first did it ordain but rather riddance from long languishment therefore my daphne they have taken away for worthy of a better place was she but me unworthy willed here to stay that with her lack i might tormented be sith then they so have ordered i will pay penance to her according their decree and to her ghost do service day by day for i will walk this wandering pilgrimage throuhout the world from one to other end and in affliction waste my better age my bred shall be the anguish of my mind my drink the tears which from mine eyes do rain my bed the ground that hardest i may find so will i wilfully increase my pain and the my love that was my saint that is when she beholds from her celestial throne in which she joyeth in eternal bliss my bitter penance will my cafe bemoan and pity me that living thus do die for heavenly spirits have compassion on mortal men and rue their misery so when i have with sorrow satisfied importune fates which vengeance on me seek and th'eauens with long languor pacified she for pure pity of my sufferance mecke will send for me for which i daily long and will tell then my painful penance ecke weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 5 henceforth i hate what ever nature made and in her workmanship no pleasure find for they be all but vain and quickly fade so soon as on them blows the northern wind they tarry not but flit and fallen away leaving behind them nought but grief of mind and mocking such as think they long will stay i hate the heaven because it does withhold me from my love and eke my love from me i hate the earth because it is the mould of fleshly slime and frail mortality i hate the fire because to nought it flies i hate the air because fighes of it be i hate the sea because it tears supplies i hate the day because it dares light to see all things and not my love to see i hate the darkness and the dreary night because they breed sad balefulness in me i hate all times because all times do fly so fast away and may not stayed be but as aspeedie post that passes by i hate to speak my voice is spent with crying i hate to hear loud plaints have dulled mine ears i hate to taste for food withholds my dying i hate to see mine eyes are dimmed with tears i hate to smell no sweet on earth is left i hate to feel my flesh is numbed with fears so all my senses from me are bereft i hate all men and shun all womankind the one because as i they wretched are the other for because i do not find my love with them that wont to be their star and life i hate because it will not last and death i hate because it life does mar and all i hate that is to come or passed so all the world and all in it i hate because it changes ever too and from and never stands in one certain state but still unsteadfast round about does go like a mill wheel in midst of misery driven with streams of wretchedness and woe that dying lives and living still does die so do i live so do i daily die and pine away in self-consuming pain sith she that did my vital powers supply and feeble spirits in their force maintain is fetched from me why seek i to prolong my weary days in dolour and disdain weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 6 why do i longer live in life's despite and do not die then in despite of death why do i longer see this loathsome light and do in darkness not abridge my breath sith all my sorrow should have end thereby and cares find quiet is it so uneath to leave this life or dolorous to die to live i find it deadly dolorous for life draws care and care continual woe therefore to die must needs be joyous and wishful thing this fad life to forgo but i must stay i may it not amend my daphne hence departing bade me so she bade me stay till she for me did send yet whilst i in this wretched vale do stay my weary feet shall ever wandering be that still i may be ready on my way when as her messenger does come for me ne will i rest my feet for feebleness ne will i rest my limbs for frailty ne will i rest mine eyes for heaviness but as the mother of the gods that sought for fair eurydice her daughter deer throughout the world with woeful heavy thought so will i travel whilst i tarry here ne will i lodge ne will i ever lin ne when as drooping titan draws near to lose his teem will i take up my inn ne sleep the harbinger of weary wights shall ever lodge upon mine eyelids more ne shall with rest refresh my fainting sprights nor failing force to former strength restore but i will wake and sorrow all the night with philumene my fortune to deplore with philumene the partner of my plighted and ever as i see the star to fallen and under ground to go to give them light which dwell in darkness i to mind will call how my fair star that shined on me so bright fell suddenly and faded under ground since whose departure day is turned to night and night without a venus star is found but soon as day does show his dewy face and calls forth men unto their toilsome trade i will withdraw me to some darksome place or some deer came or solitary shade there will i sighs and sorrow all day long and the huge burden of my cares vn lade weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 7 henceforth mine eyes shall never more behold fair thing on earth ne feed on false delight of ought that framed is of mortal mould sith that my fairest flower is faded quite for all i see is vain and transitory ne will be held in any steadfast plighted but in a moment lose their grace and glory and you found men on fortune's wheel that ride or in ought under heaven repose assurance be it riches beauty or honours pride be sure that they shall have no long endurance but ere you be aware will flit away for nought of them is yours but only usance of a small time which none ascertain may and you true lovers whom disastrous chance hath far exiled from your ladies grace to mourn in sorrow and sad sufferance when you do hear me in that desert place lamenting loud my daphnes elegy help me to wail my miserable case and when life parts vouchsafe to close mine eye and you more happy lovers which enjoy the presence of your dearest loves delight when you do hear my sorrowful annoy yet pity me in your impassioned spright and think that such mishap as chanced to me may happen unto the most happiest wight for all men's states alike unsteadfast be and you my fellow shepherds which do feed your careless flocks on hills and open plains with better fortune than did me succeed remember yet my undeserved pains and when you hear that i am dead or slain lament my lot and tell your fellow swains that sad alcyon died in life's disdain and you fair damsels shepherds deer delights that with your loves do their rude hearts possess when as my hearse shall happen to your sights vouchsafe to deck the same with cyparesse and cuer sprinckleb rackish tears among in pity of my undeserved distress the which i wretch endured have thus long and you poor pilgrimss that with resslesse toil weary your selves in wandering desert ways till that you come where you your vows assoil when passing by you read these wosfull lays on my graven written rue my daphnes wrong and mourn for me that languish out my days cease shepherd cease and end thy undersong thus when he ended had his heavy plaint the heaviest plaint that ever i herd found his cheeks waxed pale and sprights began to faint as if again he would have fallen to ground which when i saw i stepping to him light amooued him out of his stony swoon and gan him to recomfort as i might but he no way recomforted would be nor suffer solace to approach him me but casting up asdeinfull eye at me that in his tramce i would not loath him lie did rend his hair and beatrice his blubbered face as one disposed wilfully to die that i soar grieved to see his wretched ase tho when the pang was somewhat overpassed and the outrageous passion nigh appeased i him desyrde sith day was overcast and dark night fast approached to be pleased to turn aside unto my cabinet and stay with me till he were better eased of that strong stound which him so soar beset but by no means i could him win thereto ne longer him entreat with me to stay but without taking leave he forth did go with staggering pace and dismal looks dismay as if that death he in the face had seen or hellish hags had met upon the way but what of him became i cannot ween finis\", \"axiochus a most excellent dialogue written in greek by plato the philosopher concerning the shortness and uncertainty of this life with the contrary ends of the good and wicked translated out of greek by edw. spenser hereto is annexed a sweet speech or oration spoken at the triumph at white-hall before her majesty by the page to the right noble earl of oxenforde cb. semper eadem at london printed for cuthbert burbie and are to be sold at the middle shop in the poultry under s. mildreds church anno. 1592. to the right worshipful master benedic barnam esquire alderman and sheriff of this honourable city of london health and happiness worshipful sir i am bold by way of dedication to give ye this excellent dialogue of plato the philosopher for two reasons the first that so singular a work done by a heathen man might as well flourish in our vulgar speech as of long time it hath done both in greek and latin the seconde that your countenance might shadow it from reproachful slanders which common censures too lightly bolt out against the best endeavours but concerning the special matter to wit my presumption without first acquainting ye herewith thus i protect my self my familiarity with ye in your younger years when sometime we were scholars together and my present joy to see you so happy a succeeder both in your father's virtues place and office emboldened me to show a remembrance of the one yet reverently and gladness of the other as well becomes me if in this small gift you make acceptance both of the one and other ye shall declare no less then each one well discerns in you and joy him that every way is at your command to the reader this dialogue of axiochus gentle reader was translated out of greek by that worthy scholar and poet master edward spenser whose studies have & do carry no mean commendation because their deserts are of so great esteem if herein thou find not the delightful pleasures his verses yields yet shalt thou receive matter of as high contentment to wit comfort in the very latest extremity for his sake then be kind in acceptance hereof and do him the right he very well deserves axiochus of plato or a dialogue of death being both short and very elegant socrates clinias axiochus as i went one day to my common school lynosargus and being in the way by elizeus i might hear the voice of one calling aloud to me socrates and turning me about to see whence it came i saw clinias axiochus his son together with damon the musician & charmides the son of glauco running hastily towards callirrhoe whereof the one was a master and professor of the art of music & the other by means of great familiarity & acquaintance did both love him and also was of him beloved whereupon i thought good leaving my ready way to go meet them that i might the sooner understand his meaning then clinias bursting out in tears oh socrates quod he now is the time when thou mayest show forth thy long fostered and famous wisdom for my father is even now taken with a grievous disease and drawing near as it seems to his end is therewithal grievously troubled and greatly disquieted howbeit heretofore he was so far from the fear of death as that he was wont pleasantly to scoff and scorn at those which used to portrait the image of death painting him with a dreadful countenance and a grisly face wherefore i beseech thee oh socrates to go and comfort my father as you were wont to do for so the rather being strengthened with your good counsel he shall be able without any grudging or fainting to pass through the way of all flesh and i with the rest of his friends and kinsmen will maintain the yearly memory of that his good end socrates o clinias i will not deny thy so reasonable a request specially concerning such a matter as to deny it were great unkindness and discourtesy to grant it pertaineth both to godliness and charity let us therefore speed us to him for if thy father be in so soar taking there needs speediness and great haste clinias o socrates i am sure that my father assoon as he but beholdeth you will be much better at ease for his fit and pangs of his sickness use oftentimes to surcease and be assuaged socrates but that we might the sooner come to him we took the way which lies beside the town wall by the gardens for his dwelling was hard by the gates which lies towards the amazons pillar whither we coming found axiochus which by this time was come to himself again being indeed somewhat strong in his body but very weak and feeble in his mind and resting altogether comfortless often tossing him and tumbling up and down in his bed fetching deep and doleful sighs with abundant streams of trickling tears and wailful wringing of his hands whom beholding oh axiochus quoth i what means this where be now those haughty and courageous words wherewith thou wast wont to scorn and despise death where be those thy daily and continual praises of virtue and goodness vanished where also is now that thy unspeakable stoutness wherewith thou wast wont to confirm thy self and strengthen others for like as a cowardly champion which at the first coming forth as to the skirmish with stately steps and a vaunting visage doth soon after cast away his target and takes him to flight even so seemest thou now when there is need most of all to flinch hast thou no more regard of thy divine and excellent nature that sometime wast a man of so good life and calling so obedient to reasons rule and if there were nothing else yet should it be sufficient to move thee that thou art and athenian born and lastly should move thee that common saying which is worn in all men's mouths that this our life is a pilgrimage which when we have ended with perfect measure and steadfast travel it behooves us with like constancy of mind and ioyfulnes of spirit and as it were singing a merry paean to enter into the purposed place of rest but thus to languish in despair and tender hearted outcries behaving thy self like a froward babe in thee is neither regard of thy wisdom nor respect of thy age axiochus true indeed oh socrates and that which thou sayest me seems right but it comes to pass i know not how that when i draw near unto present danger than those great and stouthearted words which i was wont to cast at death do closely flit away and down are trodden underfoot and then that torment or fear the messenger of dreaded dangers doth sundry ways wound and gall my grieved mind whispering continually in mine ear that if i be once deprived of this worldly light and bereft of goods i shall like a rotten block lie in the darksome depth neither seen nor herd of any being resolved into dust and worms socrates o axiochus thy talk is very foolish for reasoning thus without reason and seeking to make some sense of senseless words thou both dost and sayest clean contrary to thy self not marking how at one time thou dost both complain for the lack of sense which thou shalt have and also art greatly vexed for the rotting of thy carrion carcase and despoiling of thy former delights as if by this death thou shouldst not pass into another life or shouldst be so despoiled of all sense and feeling as thou wertenberg before thou wast first brought into this world for even as in those years when draco and callisthenes governed the common wealth of athens thou then wast vexed with no evil for in the beginning thou wast not such as to whom evil might chance so likewise when thou hast ended this state of mortality thou shalt no more be afflicted for thou shalt not be in such case as that any evil can touch thee wherefore shake off and castaway all these trifles and worldly baggage thus weighing in thy mind that when the frame of this earthly building is dissolved and the soul being singled is restored to his natural place this body which is then left and earthly mass and and unreasonable substance is then no more a man for we are a soul that is to say and immortal creature being shut up and enclosed in and earthly dungeon vvherewithall nature hath clothed us and charged us with many misery's so that even those things which seem pleasant to us and joyful are indeed but vain and shadowed being mingled and wrapped in many thousand sorrows and those also which use to breed us sorrow and heaviness are both sudden and therefore more hardly avoided and also perdurable and therefore the more painful and wearisome such be diseases and inflammation of the senses such be inward griefs and sicknesses through which it cannot choose but that the soul must be also diseased since that being scattered and spread through the powers and passages of the body it covets the use of that open and kind heaven out of which it was derived and thirsteth for the wonted company & surpassing delights of that aerernall fellowship whereby it is evident that the passage from life is a change from much evil to great good axiochus since therefore oh socrates thou deemest this life so tedious and troublesome why dost thou still abide in the same being as thou art a man of so great wisdom and experience whose knowledge reaches far above our common sense and beyond the usual reason of most men socrates thou axiochus dost not report rightly of me for thou judgest as the common people of athens that because you see i am given to seek and search out many things therefore i know somewhat but to say the truth i would heartily wish and would the same account in great part of happiness if i knew but these common and customable matters so far am i from the knowledge of those high and excellent things for these things which i now declare are the sayings of prodicus the wise man some of them being bought for a penny some for two groats and other some for foure for that same notable man used to teach none without wages having always in his mouth that saying of epicharmus one hand rubbeth another give somewhat and somewhat take and it is not long since that he making a discourse of philosophy in the house of callias the son of hipponicus such and so many things he spoke against the state of life that i also account life in the number of those things which be of less weight and ever since that time oh axiochus my soul gaspeth after death daily longing to die axiochus what then was said of prodicus socrates marry i will tell you as they come to my mind for what parcel quod he of our life is not full of wretchedness doth not the baby even taken from the mother's womb pour out plenty of tears beginning the first step of life with grief neither afterwards hath it once any breathing or resting time from sorrow being either distressed with poverty or pinched with cold or scorched with heat or pained with stripes and whatsoever it suffers utter once it cannot but only with crying doth show his mind having no voice but that alone to bewray his grief and having through many woes waded to seauen years of age he is yet afflicted with greater griefs being subject to the tyranny of the schoolmaster and tutor and as his years increased so is the number of his guides and governors increased being afterwards in the hands of censors philosophers and captains soon after being waxed a stripling he is hemmed in with greater fear namely of lyceum of the academy of the school of games of rulers of rods and to shut up all in one word of infinite misery's and all the time of his youth is spent under overseers which are set over him by the areopagits from which labours young men being once freed are yet overlaid with greater cares and more weighty thoughts touching the ordering of his state and trade of life which also if they be compared with those that follow all these former troubles may seem but childish and indeed babish trifles for hereupon doth a troop of evils accrue as be the exploits of warfare the bitterness of wounds the continual labour skirmishes and then closely creeps on old age in which are heaped all the harms that pertain to mankind whither of weakness as natural or of pain as being external and but if one betimes restore his life as a due debt to death nature ever waiting as a greedy usurer takes pains aforehand snatching and pulling from this man his sighed from that his hearing from some both two senses and if any fortune longer then commonly is seen in this life to linger nature weakening his powers doth lose lame and bow down all parts of his body but they whose bodies in old age long flourishes in mind as the saying is become twice children and therefore the gods knowing what is most expedient for men those whom they most dearly love do soonest take out of this vale of wretchedness and for this cause agamedes and trophonius when they had built a temple to pythius apollo desiring of the god therefore to grant them the best reward that might be given soon after when they laid them down to rest never rose again likewise cleobis & biton the sons of the argive nun when their mother had made his prayer to iuno that to her sons for their great godliness might be given some singular gift for that they when her yoke of oxen were not readily to be found at the time of sacrifice themselves being yoked in the chariot drew their mother to the temple upon this their mother's request the two sons the next morning were found dead it were too long in this place to rehearse the testimonies of poets which in their divine poesies do divinely bewail and lament the misery's of men life i will now only in place of many recite the witness of one being most worthy of memory which thus says how wretched a thread of life have the gods spun to mortal men that in this raze of life do run ▪ and again of all that in the earth are ordained by nature than man is not to be found a more wretched creature but of amphiaraus what says the poet him loved highest iupiter and apollo deer yet could he not reach to his eldest year what thinkest thou of him that taught the child to cry when first the sun bright day he sees with tender eye but i will let them pass least contrary to promise i seem to discourse at large and that in the alleging of foreign witnesses what trade of life i pray you is there or what occupation of which you shall not find many that complain and greatly mislike of their present affairs let us overrun the companies of artificers & craftsmen which continually labour from night to night and yet hardly able to find them necessaries to live by bewailing their bore estate & filling their nightwatchings with sorrow and tears let us else suruew the life of mariners and seafaring men which make a hold through so many dangers & which as bias said are neither in the number of the living nor yet of the dead for man being born to abide upon the earth doth as it were a creature of a double kind thrust himself into the main sea and wholly put his life into the hands of fortune but the life of husbandmen will some say is pleasant and so in deed it is but have they not a continual rankling gall ever breeding new cause of grief and disquiet sometime by reason of drought sometime because of rain otherwhile for scorching oft through blasting which parcheth the untimely ear oftentimes because of importunate heat or unmeasurable cold miserably weeping and complaining but above all that honourable state of government and principality for i let pass many other things & wrap them up in silence through how many dangers is it tossed and turmoiled for if at any time it have any cause of joy it is like unto a blown blister or a swelling soar soon up and sooner down oftentime suffering a foul repulse which seems a thousand times worse then death it self for who at any time can be blessed that hangs upon the wavering will of the witless many and albeit the magistrate deserve favour and praise yet is he but a mocking stock and scoff of the commonalty being soon after outcast hissed at condemned and delivered to a miserable death for where i pray thee oh axiochus thee i ask that art in office in the commonwealth died that mighty miltiades where that victorious themistocles where that valiant ephialtes where finally thse noble kings and glorious emperors which not long a go flourished in the common wealth as for my self i could never be brought to bear office in the city for i never accounted it as a worthy and laudable thing to be in authority together with the madding multitude but theramenes and calixenus of late memory appointing under them certain magistrates condemned certain guiltless men not hearing their causes to undeserved death only withstood them you and triptolemus of thirty thousand men which were gathered in the assembly axiochus it is as thou sayest socrates and since that time i have refrained my self from the stage neither hath any thing ever to me seemed of greater waighte then the governing of the commonwealth and that is well known to them which are in the same office for thou speakest these things as having out of some high loft only overlooked the troubles and tempests of the commonwealth but we know the same more assuredly having made proof therefore in ourselves for the common people indeed our friends socrates is unthankful disdainful cruel envious and unlearned as that is gathered together of the scum and dregs of the rascal rout and a sort of idle lozels whom he that flattereth and feeds is much worse himself than they socrates since therefore oh axiochus thou dost so greatly disallow that opinion which of all other is counted most honest and liberal what shall we judge of the other trades of life shall we not think that they are likewise to be shunned i remember that i once herd prodicus say that death pertaineth neither to the living nor to the dead axiochus how mean you that socrates socrates mary thus that death touches not them that are and as for those that are departed out of this life are now no more and therefore death now touches them not for thou art not yet dead neither if thou decease shall it concern thee for thou shalt then have no more therefore most vain is that sorrow which axiochus makes for the thing which neither is present nor shall ever touch axiochus himself and even as foolish is it as if one should complain and be afraid of scylla or the centaur's which were monsters of poets brood which neither now belong to thee nor to thy lives end shall appertain for fear is conceived of such things as be but of such things as be not what fear can there be axiochus truly socrates you have fetched these things out of the rich and most abundant storehouse of your wondered wisdom and thereof riseth that your mildness and lightness of speech which you use to allure the minds of young men to virtue but the loss of these worldly commodities doth not a little vex and disquiet my mind albeit these reasons which now to my great good liking you have alleged seem to me much more allowable than those which late you used for my mind is not carried away with error through the enticement of your words but perceives them well neither do those things greatly move my mind which only have a colour and shadowed show of truth being set out with flaunting pride and glory of words but yet truth have they none socrates thou art far wide axiochus and reasonest unskilfully joining the feeling of evil with the want of good things forgetting thy self that then thou shalt be in the number of the senseless dead for him indeed which is bereft of all good things doth the contrary force of evil things greatly vex but he which hath no being can take nor feel nothing in place of those things whereof he is despoiled then by what reason can any grief be conceived of that thing which breeds no sense nor perseverance of any thing which hurteth for if in the beginning o axiochus thou didst not though indeed in vain join sense and feeling to death most unwisely thou shouldst never had cause to fear death but now thou dost confound thy self and speakest contrary to thy self oft fearing that thou shalt be deprived of soul and sense together and oft thinking that with thy sense thou shalt feel that thing whereof there is no sense nor feeling and to this purpose do all those excellent and notable reasons of the souls immortality tend for it is not the weak nature of mortal man to raise himself to the fulfilling of such high and haughty matters as to despise the ramping rage of wild beasts to jeopard himself in the wasteful sea to build cities and them with laws and policy to establish to look up into heaven and mark the course of the stars and the ways of the sun and moon with their risings and setting to consider their eclipses their spaces their making of the nights and days alike their double conversions to behold the order of the winds the seauen watery stars of winter of summer of storms with the violent rage of whirlwinds and as it were these labours of the world to deliver to posterity unless in our minds there were a certain divine spirit and understanding which could comprehend and reach unto the supernatural knowledge of so great matters wherefore now oh axiochus thou art not in the way to death but to immortality neither shalt thou as thou didst seem right now to fear be bereft of all good but shall hereby enjoy true and perfect good neither shalt thou perceive such dirty pleasures as are these being mingled with the puddle of this sinful body but most pure and perfect delight being devoid of all contagious trouble for being loosed and delivered out of the darksome dungeons of this body thou shalt pass to that place where is no lack nor complaint but all things full of rest and devoid of evil moreover there is calm and quiet living without all knowledge of unrest peaceable and still occupied in beholding the course & frame of nature and studying philosophy not to please the idle ignorant and common sort but with upright and undeceivable truth axiochus o socrates with this thy gladsome speech thou hast now brought me into a clean contrary mind for so far am i now from dread of death that i am even set on fire and burn with desire thereof and that i may stay my self in the steps of them which are counted workmasters of speech i will say thus much more excellently now i begin to behold those high matters and do overlook that eternal and heavenly course of things having now raised up my self out of my weakness and being as it were renewed and refreshed of my former malady socrates if you demand of me another reason and sign of the souls immortality i will tell you what the wise man gobrias showed me he said that at what time xerxes conveyed his huge army into greece his grandfather which was of the same name was sent into delos to defend that island in which were two gods born in the same island that his grandfather learned out of certain brazen tables which opis and hecuergus had brought out of the northern countries that the soul aftertime it is dissolved from the body passes into a certain darksome place a coast that lies under the earth wherein is plutoes palace no less than iupiters kingdom for the earth being equally balanced in the midst of the world and the compass thereof being round as a ball that the one half sphere thereof is allotted to the higher gods and the other half to the infernal powers betwixt whom there is such kindred and alliance that some be brother's and other some brother's children but the entry of the way which leads to plutoes kingdom is fenced with iron gates and fastened with brazen bolts which when a man hath opened he is entertained of the river acheron next which is cocytus which floods being overpassed he must come before minos and rhadamanthus the merciless judges which place is called the plain of truth where the judges fit examining every one that comes thither how he hath lived and with what trade or manner of life he hath inhabited his mortal body with whom there is no place for lies nor refuge for excuses then they which in their life time were inspired and led with a good angel are received into the household of the blessed where all seasons flow with abundance of all fruits where from the silver springs do calmly run the crystal streams where the flourishing meadows are clothed with changeable mantles of glorious colours where are famous schools of renowned philosophers goodly companies of divine poets trim sorts of dancers heavenly music great banquets furnished with costly cates tables abounding with all bounty delights without all care and pleasures without all pain for the inhabitants thereof are neither touched with force of cold nor pained with excess of heat but the moderate air breathes on them mildly and calmly being lightened with the gentle sunnebeames in this place and in the elysian fields they which have taken holy order are highly advanced and reverenced daily ministering the unsearchable rites of religion wherefore then shouldst thou doubt but to be made partaker of the same honour being one of the seed of that heavenly raze it is and old saying and rightly reported that hercules and bacchus going down to hell they were instituted in holly order and that they were emboldened to go thither of the goddess eleusina but they which being wrapped in wickedness have led and ungodly life are snatched up by the furies and by them carried through the lowest hell into deep darkness and utter confusion where the place and abided of the wicked is and where the three score daughters of danaus dwell whose punishment is continually to fill a sort of bottomless vessels where also is to be seen the unquenchable thirst of tantalus the gnawen entrails of titius and the endless stone of sisipus whose end begins a new labour there be they rend of wild beasts continually scorched with burning lamps pained with all kind of torments and afflicted with endless penance these things i remember that i have herd gobrias tell but you axiochus may judge of them as you list only this i know and assuredly hold fast that every men mind is immortal and passing out of this life feeleth no grief nor sorrow wherefore oh axiochus whither thou be carried into those highest palaces or lower vawts needs must it be that thou shalt be blessed because thou hast lived well and godly axiochus minding to have said something unto thee oh socrates i am impeached with bashful shame for so far am i now from the horror and dread of death that i continually covet the time thereof so hath thy heavenly and comfortable speeches pierced and relieved my faint heart and now loath i this life and scorn the delights thereof as that shall from henceforth pass into a better abided and now by my self alone will i recount these thy notable sayings but i pray thee oh socrates after noon resort to me again socrates i will do as you say and now will i return to walk in my school lynosargus from whence i was hither called finis ❧ a speech spoken at the triumph before the queens most excellent majesty by the page to the right noble champion the earl of oxenford by the tilt stood a stately tent of orenge tawny taffeta curiously embroidered with silver & pendents on the pinnacles very sightly to behold from forth this tent came the noble earl of oxenford in rich gilded armour and sat down under a great high bay-tree the whole stock branches and leaves whereof were all gilded over that nothing but gold could be discerned by the tree stood twelue tilting staves all which likewise were gilded clean over after a solemn found of most sweet music he mounted on his courser very richly caparasond when his page ascending the stairs where her highness stood in the window delivered to her by speech this oration following this knight most fair and fortunate princess living of a long time in a grove where every grafted being green he thought every root to be precious found at the last as great diversity of troubles as of trees the oak to be so stubborn that nothing could cause it to bend the reed so shaking that every blast made it to bow the juniper sweet but too low for succour the cypress fair but without fruit the walnut tree to be as unwholesome to lie under as the bud of the figtree unpleasant to taste the tree that boar the best fruit to be fullest of caterpillars and all to be infected with worms the ash for ravens to breed the elm to built the elder to be full of pith & no perfection and all trees that were not fertile to be fit for fuel and they that were fruitful but for the time to please the fancy which trying he forsook the wood and lived a while in the plain champion where how he was tormented it were too long to tell but let this suffice that he was troubled when every moat fell in his eye in the day and every ant disquieted him in the night where if the wind blew he had nothing to shield him but head and shoulders if the sun blazed he could find the shadow of nothing but himself when seeing himself so destitute of help he becam desperate of hope thus wandering a weary way he espied at the last a tree so beautiful that his eyes were dazzled with the brightness which as he was going unto he met by good fortune a pilgrim or hermit he knew not well who being appareled as though he were to travail into all countries but so aged as though he were to live continually in a cave of this old sire he demanded what tree it was who taking this knight by the hand began in these words both to utter the name and nature of the tree this tree fair knight is called the tree of the sun whose nature is always to stand alone not suffering a companion being it self without comparison of which kind there are no more in the earth then suns in the element the world can hold but one phoenix one alexander one sun-tree in top contrary to all trees it is strongest & so stately to behold that the more other shrubs shrink for duty the higher it exalteth it self in majesty for as the clear beams of the sun cause all the stars to loose their light so the brightness of this golden tree eclipseth the commendation of all other plants the leaves of pure gold the bark no worse the buds pearls the body chrisocolla the sap nectar the root so noble as it springs from two turkeies both so perfect as neither can stain the other each contending once for superiority and now both constrained to be equals vestas bird sitteth in the midst whereat cupid is ever drawing but dares not shoot being amazed at that princely and perfect majesty the shadows hath as strange properties as contrarieties cooling those that be hot with a temperate calm and heating those that be cold with a moderate warmth not unlike that sun whereof it takes the name which melts wax and hardeneth clay or pure fire which causeth the gold to shine and the straw to smother or sweet perfumes which feeds the bee and killeth the betell no poison comes near it nor any vermin that hath a sting who so goes about to lop it lanceth himself and the sun will not shine on that creature that casts a false eye on that tree no wind can so much as wag a leaf it springs in spite of autumnus and continueth all the year as it were ʋer if sir knight you demand what fruit it bears i answer such as the elder it is the younger it seems always ripe yet ever green virtue sir knight more nourishing to honest thoughts then the beauty delightful to amorous eyes where the graces are as thick in virtue as the grapes are on the vine this fruit fatteth but never feeds wherewith this tree is so loaded as you cannot touch that place which virtue hath not tempered if you inquire whither any grafts may be got it were as much as to crave slyppes of the sun or a mould to cast a new moon to conclude such a tree it is as he that hath longest known it can sooner marvel at it then describe it for the further he wadeth in the praise the shorter he comes of the perfection this old man having ended seeming to want words to express such worthiness he went to his home and the knight to his sun tree where kissing the ground with humility the princely tree seemed with to bid him welcome but the more z on the beauty the less able he w dure the brightness like unto those king with a steadfast eye to behold that bring a dark dazzling over their sighed at the last resting under the shadow he felt such content as nothing could be more comfortable the days he spent in virtuous delights the night slipped away in golden dreams he was never annoyed with venomous enemies nor disquieted with idle cogitations in so much that finding all felicity in that shade and all security in that sun he made a solemn vow to incorporate his heart into that tree and ingraft his thoughts upon those virtues swearing that as there is but one sun to shine over it one root to give life unto it one top to maintain majesty so there should be but one knight either to live or die for the defence thereof whereupon he swore himself only to be the knight of the tree of the sun whose life should end before his loyalty thus cloyed with content he fell into a sweet slumber whose smiling countenance showed him void of all care but his eyes were scarce close d when he seemed to see dy ermining the tree behind him that suspecting the knight to gyve thee might have punished him in her failing of their pretence and seeing we they struck to light upon their wne brains they threatened him by violence whom they could not match in virtue but he clasping the tree as the only anchor of his trust they could not so much as move him from his cause whom they determined to martyr without colour whereupon they made a challenge to win the tree by right and to make it good by arms at which saying the knight being glad to have his truth tried with his valour for joy awaked and now most virtuous and excellent princess seeing such tumults towards for his tree such and honourable presence to judge such worthy knights to just i cannot tell whither his perplexity or his pleasure be the greater but this he will avouch at all assays himself to be the most loyal knight of the sun-tree which who so gainsayeth he is here pressed either to make him recant it before he run or repent it after offering rather to die upon the points of a thousande lances then to yield a jot in constant loyalty finis the speech being ended with great honour he ran and valiantly brake all the twelue staves and after the finishing of the sports both the rich bay-tree and the beautiful tent were by the standers by torn and rend in more pieces then can be numbered\", \"prothalamion or a spousal verse made by edm. spenser in honovr of the double marriage of the two honourable &

delay hight titans beams which then did glyster fair when i whom sullen care through discontent of my long fruitless stay in princes court and expectation vain of idle hope's which still do fly away like empty shadows did afflict my brain walked forth to ease my pain along the shore of silver streaming themmes whose rutty bank the which his river hemmes was painted all with variable flowers and

in a meadow by the rivers side a flock of nymphs i chanced to espy all lovely daughters of the flood thereby with goodly greenish locks all lose untied as each had be a bride and each one had a little wicker basket made of fine twigs entrailed curiously in which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket and with fine fingers cropped full feateously the tender stalks on high of every sort which in that meadow grew they gathered some the violet pallid blew the little dazie that at evening closes the virgin lillie and the primrose true with store of vermeil roses to deck their bridegroom's posies

yet did never see the snow which does the top of pindus strew did never whiter show nor ioue himself when he a swan would be for love of leda whiter did appear yet leda was they say as white as he yet not so white as these nor nothing near so purely white they were that even the gentle stream the which them bore seemed foul to them and bade his billows spare to wet their silken feathers lest they might soil their fair plumes with water not so fair and mar their beauty's bright that shone as heavens light against their brydale day which was not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 4 prothalamion eftsoones the nymphs which now had flowers their fill ran all in haste to see that silver brood as they came floating on the crystal flood whom when they saw they stood amazed still their wondering eyes to fill them seemed they never saw a sighed so fair of fowls so lovely that they sure did deem them heavenly born or to be that same pair which through the sky draw venus silver teem for sure they did not seem to be begotten of any earthly seed but rather angels or of angels breed yet were they bred of somers-heat they say in sweetest season when each flower and weed the earth did

store of flowers the honour of the field that to the sense did fragrant odours yield all which upon those goodly birds they threw and all the waves did strew that like old peneus waters they did seem

did resound so forth those joyous birds did pass along adown the lee that to them murmurde low as he would speak but that he lacked a tonge yet did by signs his glad affection show making his stream

    "### Now that we can run tf-idf with plain Python, we can learn how to run it using other libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover how to run exactly the same process as in the Session 4 notebook, but using SciKit Learn and pandas instead. You'll need to install these on the command line using `pip install libraryname` before you begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll mostly follow the techniques of [the Programming Historian tutorial on tf-idf](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/analyzing-documents-with-tfidf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping your head around these libraries takes a little work, but it's ultimately much easier than doing the calculations yourself. As we move to more advanced calculations, doing so would be almost impossible, so it's worth figuring out SKLearn now."

look and read the sorrows of my dying spright written with tears in hearts close bleeding book and happy rhymes bathed in the sacred brook of helicon whence she derived is when you behold that angels blessed look my souls long lacked food my heavens bliss leaves lines and rhymes seek her to please alone whom if you please i care for other none sonnet ii unquiet thought whom at the first i bred of inward bale of my love pined heart and since have with sighs and sorrows fed till greater then my womb thou waxed art break forth at length out of the inner part in which thou lurkest like to vipers brood and seek some succour both to ease my smart and also to sustain thy self with food but if in presence of that fairest proud thou chance to come fallen lowly at her feet and with meek humbleness and afflicted mood pardon for thee and grace for me entreat which if she grant then live and my love cherish if not die soon and i with thee will perish sonnet iii the sovereign beauty which i do admire witness the world how worthy to be prayzed the light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire in my frail spirit by her from baseness raised that being now with her huge brightness dazed base thing i can no more endure to view but looking still on her i stand amazed at wondrous sighed of so celestial hew so when my tongue would speak her praises due it stopped is with thoughts astonishment and when my pen would write her titles true it ravished is with fancies wonderment yet in my heart i then both speak and write the wonder that my wit cannot endite sonnet iiii new year forth looking out of ianus gate does seem to promise hope of new delight and bidding th'old adieu his passed date bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish spright and calling forth out of sad winter's night fresh love that long hath slept in cheerless bower wills him awake and soon about him dight his wanton wings and darts of deadly power for lusty spring now in his timely hour is ready to come forth him to receive and warns the earth with diverse colord flower to deck his self and her fair mantle weave then you fair flower in whom fresh youth does rain prepare your self new love to entertain sonnet v. rudely thou wrongest my deer hearts desire in finding fault with her too portly pride the thing which i do most in her admire is of the world unworthy most envied for in those lofty looks is close implide scorn of base things & disdain of foul dishonour threatening rash eyes which gaze on her so wide that loosely they ne dare to look upon her such pride is praise such portliness is honour that boldened innocence bears in his eyes and her fair countenance like a goodly banner spreads in defiance of all enemies was never in this world ought worthy tried without some spark of such self-pleasing pride sonnet vi be nought dismayed that her unmoved mind does still persist in her rebellious pride such love not like to lustest of baser kind the harder won the firmer will abide the duresull oak whose sap is not yet dried is long ere it conceive the kindling fire but when it once does burn it does divide great heat and makes his flames to heaven aspire so hard it is to kindle new desire in gentle breast that shall endure for ever deep is the wound that dints the parts entire with chaste affects that nought but death can sever then think not long in taking little pain to knit the knot that ever shall remain sonnet vii fair eyes the mirror of my mazed heart what wondrous virtue is contained in you the which both life and death forth from you dart into the object of your mighty view for when you mildly look with lovely hew then is my soul with life and love inspired but when you lower or look on me askew then do i die as one with lightning fired but since that life is more then death desired look ever lovely as becomes you best that your bright beams of my weak eyes admired may kindle living fire within my breast such life should be the honour of your light such death the sad ensample of your might sonnet viii more then most fair full of the living fire kindled above unto the maker near no eyes but joys in which all powers conspire that to the world nought else be counted deer through your bright beams does not the blinded guest shoot out his darts to base affections wound but angels come to led frail minds to rest in chaste desires on heavenly beauty bound you frame my thoughts and fashion me within you stop my tongue and teach my heart to speak you calm the storm that passion did begin strong through your cause but by your virtue weak dark is the world where your light shined never well is he born that may behold you ever sonnet ix long-while i sought to what i might compare those powerful eyes which lighten my dark spright yet find i nought on earth to which i dare resemble image of their goodly light not to the sun for they do shine by night nor to the moon for they are changed never nor to the stars for they have purer sighed nor to the fire for they consume not ever nor to the lightning for they still persever nor to the diamond for they are more tender nor unto crystal for nought may them sever nor unto glass such baseness might offend her then to the maker self they likest be whose light does lighten all that here we see sonnet x. unrighteous lord of love what law is this that me thou makest thus tormented be the while she lordeth in licentious bliss of her freewill scorning both thee and me see how the tyranness does joy to see the huge massacres which her eyes do make and humbled hearts brings captives unto thee that thou of them mayest mighty vengeance take but her proud heart do thou a little shake and that high look with which she does comptrol all this world's pride bow to a baser make and all her faults in thy black book enrol that i may laugh at her in equal sort as she does laugh at me & makes my pain her sport sonnet xi dayly when i do seek and sew for peace and hostages do offer for my truth she cruel warrior does her self address to battle and the weary war reneweth ne will moved with reason or with rewth to grant small respite to my restless toil but greedily her fell intent poursewth of my poor life to make vnpitteid spoil yet my poor life all sorrows to assoil i would her yield her wrath to pacify but then she seeks with torment and turmoil to force me live and will not let me die all pain hath end and every war hath peace but mine no price nor prayer may surcease sonnet xii one day i sought with her heart-thrilling eyes to make a truce and terms to entertain all fearless then of so false enemies which sought me to entrap in treasons train so as i then disarmed did remain a wicked ambush which lay hidden long in the close covert of her guileful eyes thence breaking forth did thick about me throng too feeble i abide the brunt so strong was forced to yield my self into their hands who me captiuing straight with rigorous wrong have ever since me kept in cruel bans so lady now to you i do complain against your eyes that justice i may gain sonnet xiii in that proud port which her so goodly graceth while her fair face she rears up to the sky and to the ground her eye lids low embaseth most goodly temperature you may descry mild humbleness mixed with awful majesty for looking on the earth whence she was born her mind remember her mortality what so is fairest shall to earth return but that same lofty countenance seems to scorn base thing & think how she to heaven may climb treading down earth as loathsome and forlorn that hinders heavenly thoughts with drossy slime yet lowly still vouchsafe to look on me such lowliness shall make you lofty be sonnet xiiii retourne again my forces late dismayed unto the siege by you abandoned quite great shame it is to leave like one afraid so fair a piece for one repulse so light gainst such strong castles needs greater might then those small forts which you were wont belay such haughty minds enured to hardy fight disdain to yield unto the first assay bring therefore all the forces that you may and lay incessant battery to her heart plaints prayers vows ruth sorrow and dismay those engines can the proudest love convert and if those fail fallen down and die before her so dying live and living do adore her sonnet xv you tradeful merchant's that with weary toil do seek most precious things to make your ga and both the indias of their treasures spoil what needs you to seek so far in vain for lo my love does in her self contain all this world's riches that may far be found if sapphires lo her eyes be sapphires plain if rubies lo his lips be rubies found if pearls his teeth be pearls both pure and round if ivory her forehead ivory ween if gold her locks are finest gold on ground if silver her fair hands are silver sheen but that which fairest is but few behold her mind adorned with virtues manifold sonnet xvi one day as i unwarily did gaze on those fair eyes my loves immortal light the while my astonished heart stood in amaze through sweet illusion of her looks delight i mote perceive how in her glancing sighed legions of loves with little wings did fly darting their deadly arrows fyry bright at every rash beholder passing by one of those archers closely i did spy aiming his arrow at my very heart when suddenly with twincle of her eye the damosel broke his misintended dart had she not so done sure i had be slain yet as it was i hardly scaped with pain sonnet xvii the glorious portrait of that angels face made to amaze weak men's confused skill and this world's worthless glory to embase what pen what pencil can express her fill for though he colours could devise at will and eke his learned hand at pleasure guide lest trembling it his workmanship should spill yet many wondrous things there are beside the sweet eye-glaunces that like arrows glide the charming smiles that rob sense from the heart the lovely pleasance and the lofty pride cannot expressed be by any art a greater craftsmans hand thereto does need that can express the life of things indeed sonnet xviii the rolling wheel that runneth often round the hardest steel in tract of time does tear and drizzling drops that often do redound the firmest flint does in continuance wear yet cannot i with many a dropping tear and long entreaty soften her hard heart that she will once vouchsafe my plaint to hear or look with pity on my payneful smart but when i plead she bids me play my part and when i weep she says tears are but water and when i sighs she says i know the art and when i wail she turns his self to laughter so do i weep and wail and plead in vain while she as steel and flint does still remain sonnet xix the merry cuckoo messenger of spring his trumpet shrill hath thrice already sounded that warns all lovers wait upon their king who now is coming forth with girl and crowned with noise whereof the quire of birds resounded their anthems sweet devised of loves praise that all the woods their echos back rebounded as if they knew the meaning of their lays but amongst them all which did loves honour raise no word was herd of her that most it ought but she his precept proudly disobeys and does his idle message set at nought therefore oh love unless she turn to thee ere cuckoo end let her a rebel be sonnet xx in vain i seek and sew to her for grace and do mne humbled heart before her pour the while her foot she in my neck does place and tread my life down in the lowly flower and yet the lion that is lord of power and reigneth over every beast in field in his most pride disdeigneth to devour the silly lamb that to his might does yield but she more cruel and more salvage wild then either lion or the lonesse shames not to be with guiltless blood defylde but takes glor in her cruelness fairer then fairest let none ever say that you were blooded in a yielded prey sonnet xxi was it the work of nature or of art which tempered so the featur of her face that pride and meekness mixed by equal par do both appear adorn her beauty's grace for with mild pleasnce which does pride displace she to her loves does lookers eyes allure & with stern countenance back again does chase their looser looks that stir up lusts impure with such strange terms her eyes she does inure that with one look she does my life dismay and with another does it straight reure her smile me draws her frown me drives away thus does she train and teach me with her looks such art of eyes i never read in books sonnet xxii this holy season fit to fast and pray men to devotion ought to be inclynd therefore i likewise on so holy day for my sweet saint some service fit will find her temple fair is built within my mind in which her glorious image placed is on which my thoughts do day and night attend like sacred priests that never think amiss there i to her as author of my bliss will build and altar to appease her ire and on the same my heart will sacrifice burning in flames of pure and chaste desire the which vouchsafe o goddess to accept among thy dearest relics to be kept sonnet xxiii penelope for her vlisses sake devise a web her wooers to deceive in which the work that she all day did make the same at night she did again unreave such subtle craft my damosel does conceive that ` importune suit of my desire to shun for all that i in many days do weave in one short hour i find by her undone so when i think to end that i begun i must begin and never bring to end for with one look she spills that long i spun & with one word my whole years work does rend such labour like the spiders web i find whose fruitless work is broken with least wind sonnet xxiiii when i behold that beauty's wonderment and rare perfection of each goodly part of nature's skill the only compliment i honour and admire the makers art but when i feel the bitter baleful smart which her fair eyes unwares do work in me that death out of their shiny beams do dart i think that i a new pandora see whom all the gods in council did agree into this sinful world from heaven to send that she to wicked men a scourge should be for all their aults with which they did offend but since you are my scourge i will entreat that for my faults you will me gently beatrice sonnet xxv how long shall this like dying life endure and know no end of her own misery but wast and wear away in terms unsure betwixt fear and hope depending doubtfully yet better were atonce to let me die and show the last ensample of your pride then to torment me thus with cruelty to prove your pour which i too well have tried but yet if in your hardened breast you hide a close intent at last to show me grace then all the woes and wrecks which i abide as means of bliss i gladly will embrace and wish that more and greater they might be that greater meed at last may turn to me sonnet xxvi sweet is the rose but grows upon a brere sweet is the iunipere but sharp his bough sweet is the eglantine but pricks never sweet is the firbloome but his branches rough sweet is the cypress but his rind is tough sweet is the nut but bitter is his pill sweet is the broom-flower but yet sour enough and sweet is moly but his root is ill so every sweet with sour is tempered still that makes it be coveted the more for easy things that may be god at will most sorts of men do set but little store why then should i account of little pain that endless pleasure shall unto me gain sonnet xxvii fair proud now tell me why should fair be proud sith all world's glory is but dross unclean and in the shade of death it self shall shroud how ever now thereof you little ween that goodly idol now so gay beseene shall doff her fleshes borowd fair attire and be forgotten as it had never been that many now much worship and admire ne any then shall after it inquire e any mention shall thereof remain but what this verse that never shall expire shall to you purchase with her thankless pain fair be no longer proud of that shall perish but that which shall you make immortal cherish sonnet xxviii the laurel leaf which you this day do wear guies me great hope of your relenting mind for since it is the badge which i do bear you bearing it do seem to me inclined the pour thereof which ote in me i find let it likewise your gentle breast inspire with sweet infusion and put you in mind of that proud maid whom now those leaves attire proud daphne scorning phaebus lovely fire on the thessalian shore from him did fly for which the gods in their revengeful ire did her transform into a laurel tree then fly no more fair love from phebus chase but in your breast his leaf and love embrace sonnet xxix see how the stubborn damosel does deprave my simple meaning with disdainful scorn and by the bay which i unto her gave accompts my self her captive quite forlorn the bay quoth she is of the victor's born yielded them by the vanquished as their meeds and they therewith do poets heads adorn to sing the glory of their famous deeds but sith he will the conquest challenge needs let her accept me as her faithful thrall that her great triumph which my skill exceeds i may in trump of fame blaze over all then would i deck her head with glorious bays and fill the world with her victorious praise sonnet xxx my love is like to ice and i to fire how comes it then that this her cold so great is not dissolved through my so hight desire but harder grows the more i her entreat or how comes it that my exceeding heat is not delayed by her heart frozen cold but that i burn much more in boiling sweat and feel my flames augmented maniold wht more miraculous thing may be told that fire which all thing melts should harden ice and ice which is congealed with encelesse cold should kindle fire by wonderful devise such is the pour of love in gentle mind that it can altar all the course of kind sonnet xxxi ah why hath nature to so hard a heart given so goodly gifts of beauty's grace whose pride depraues each other better part and all those precious ornaments deface sith to all other beasts of bloody raze a dreadful countenance she given hath that with their terror all the rest may chase and warn to shun the danger of their wrath but my proud one does work the greater sath through sweet allurement of her lovely hew that she the better may in bloody bath of such poor thralls her cruel hands embrew but did she know how ill these two accord such cruelty she would have soon abhorred sonnet xxxii the painful smith with force of fervent heat the hardest iron soon does mollify that with his heavy sledge he can it beatrice and fashion to what he it list apply yet cannot all these flames in which i fry her heart more harden then iron soft awhit ne all the plaints and prayers with which i do beatrice on th'anduyle of her stubborn wit but still the more she fervent sees my fit the more she frieseth in her wilful pride and harder grows the harder she is smit with all the plants which to her be applied what then remains but i to ashes burn and she to stones at length all frozen turn sonnet xxxiii great wrong i do i can it not deny to that most sacred empress my dear dreaded not finishing her queen of fairy that mote enlarge her living praises dead but lodwick this of grace to me aread do you not think accomplishment of it sufficient work for one men simple head all were it as the rest but rudely wri how then should i without another wit think ever to endure so tedious toil sins that this one is tossed with troublous it of a proud love that does my spirit spoil cease then till she vouchsafe to grawnt me rest or lend you me another living breast sonnet xxxiiii like as a ship that through the ocean wide by conduct of some star does make her way whenas a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide out of her course does wander far astray so i whose star that wont with her bright ray me to direct with clouds is overcast do wander now in darkness and dismay through hidden peils round about me placed yet hope i well that when this storm is passed my helice the lodestar of my life will shine again and look on me at last with lovely light to clear my cloudy grief till then i wander careful comfortless in secret sorrow and sad pensiveness sonnet xxxv my hungry eyes through greedy coetize still to behold the object of their pain with no contentment can themselves suffice but having pine and having not complain for lacking it they cannot life sustain and having it they gaze on it the more in their amazement like narcissus vain whose eyes him starved so plenty makes me poor yet are mine eyes so filled with the store of that fair sighed that nothing else they brook but loath the things which they did like before and can no more endure on them to look all this world's glory seems vain to me and all their shows but shadows saving she sonnet xxxvi tell me when shall these weary woes have end or shall their ruthless torment never cease but all my daes in pining languor spend without hope of aswagement or release is there no means for me to purchase peace or make agreement with her thrilling eyes but that their cruelty does still increase and daily more augment my miseries but when you have showed all extremities then think how little glory you have gained by slaying him whose life though you despise mote have your life in honour long maintained but by his death which some perhaps will moan you shall condemned be of many a one sonnet xxxvii what guile is this that those her golden tresses she does attire under a net of gold and with sl skill so cunningly them dresses that which is gold or hear may scarce be told is it that men's frail eyes which gaze too bold she may entangle in that golden snare and being caught may craftily enfold their weaker hearts which are not well aware take heed therefore mine eyes how you do tear hence forth too rashly on that guileful net in which if ever you entrapped are out of her bans you by no means shall get fondness it were for any being free to covet fetters though they golden be sonnet xxxviii a rion when through tempests cruel wrack he forth was thrown into the greedy seas through the sweet music which his harp did make allu'rd a dolphin him from death to ease but my rude music which was wont to please some dainty ears cannot with any skill the dreadful tempest of her wrath appease nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will but in her pride she doth persever still all careless how my life for her decayse yet with one word she can it save or spill to spill were pity but to save were praise chosen rather to be praised for doing good then to be blamed for spilling guiltless blood sonnet xxxix sweet smile the daughter of the queen of love expressing all thy mother's powerful art with which she wonts to temper angry ioue when all the gods he threats with thundering dart sweet is thy virtue as thy self sweet art for when on me thou shinedst late in sadness a melting pleasance ran through every part and me revived with heart robbing gladness whilst rapt with joy resembling heavenly madness my soul was ravished quite as in a trance and feeling thence no more her sorrows sadness fed on the fullness of that cheerful glance over sweet than nectar or ambrosial meat seemed every bit which thenceforth i did eat sonnet xl mark when she smiles with amiable cheer and tell me whereto can you liken it when on each eyelid sweetly do appear and hundred graces as in shade to fit likest it seems in my simple wit unto the fair sunshine in some day that when a dreadful storm away is flit through the broad world does spread his goodly ray at sighed whereof each bird that sits on spray and every beast that to his den was fled comes forth afresh out of their late dismay and to the light lift up their drooping head so my storm beaten heart likewise is cheered with that sunshine when cloudy looks are cleared sonnet xli is it her nature or is it her will to be so cruel to and humbled foe if nature then she may it mend with skill if will then she at will may will forgo but if her nature and her will be so that she will plague the man that loves her most and take delight t'encrease a wretches woe then all her nature's goodly guits are lost and that same glorious beauty's idle boast is but a bait such wretches to beguile as being long in her loves tempest ost she means at last to make her piteous spoil o fairest fair let never it be nam that so fair beauty was so foully shamed sonnet xlii the love which me so cruelly torments so pleasing is in my extremest pain that all the more my sorrow it augmenteth the more i love and do embrace my bane ne do i wish or wishing were but vain to be acquit from my continual smart but joy her thrall or ever to remain and yield for pledge my poor captived heart the which that it from her may never start let her if please her bind with adamant chain and rome all wandering loves which mote pervert his safe assurance strongly it restrain only let her abstain from cruelty and do me not before my time to die sonnet xliii shall i then silent be or shall i speak and if i speak her wrath renew i shall and if i silent be my heart will break or choked be with ouefwing gall what tyranny is this both my heart to thrall and eke my tongue with proud restraint to tie that neither i may speak nor think at all but like a stupid stock in silence die yet i my heart with silence secretly will teach to speak and my just cause to plead and eke mine eyes with meek humility love learned letters to her eyes to read which her deep wit that true hearts thought can sell will soon conceive and learn to construe well sonnet xliiii when those renowned noble peers of greece through stubborn pride among themselves did in forgetful of the famous golden fleece then orpheus with his harp their strife did bar but this continual cruel civil war the which my self against my self do make whilst my weak powers of passion warrayed are no skill can stint nor reason can aslake but when in hand my tuneless harp i take then do i more augment my foes despite and grief renew and passion do awake to battle fresh against my self to fight amongst whom the more i seek to settle peace the more i find their malice to increase sonnet xlv leaue lady in your glass of crystal clean your goodly self for evermore to view and in my self my inward self i mean most lively like behold your semblant true within my heart though hardly it can show thing so divine to view of earthly eye the fair idea of your celestial hew and every part remains immortally and were it not that through your cruelty with sorrow dimmed and deformed it were the goodly image of your visnomy clearer then crystal would therein appear but if your self in me the plain will see remove the cause by which your fair beams darkened be sonnet xlvi when my abodes prefixed time is spent my cruel fair straight bids me weened my way but then from heaven most hideous storms are sent as willing me against her will to stay whom then shall i or heaven or her obey the heavens know best what is the best for me but as she will whose will my life does sway my lower heaven so it perforce must be but you high heavens that all this sorrow see sith all your tempests cannot hold me back assuage your storms or else both you and she will both together me too sorely wrack enough it is for one man to sustain the tormes which she alone on me does rain sonnet xlvii trust not the treason of those smiling looks until you have their guyleull trains well tried for they are like but unto golden books that from the foolish sith their baits do hide so she with flattering smiles weak hearts does guide unto her love and tempt to their decay whom being caught she kills with cruel pride and feeds at pleasure on the wretched prey yet even whilst her bloody hands them sly her eyes look lovely and upon them smile that they take pleasure in her cruel play and ding do them selves of pain beguile o mighty charm which makes men love their bane and think they die with pleasure live with pain sonnet xlviii innocent paper whom too cruel hand did make the matter to avenge her ire and ee she could thy cause well understand did sacrifice unto the greedy fire well worthy thou to have found better hire then so bad end for heretics ordained yet heresy nor treason didst conspire but plead thy masters cause unjustly pained whom she all careless of his grief constrained to utter forth anguish of his heart and would not hear when he to her complained the piteous passion oh his dying smart yet live for ever though against her will and speak her good though she requite it ill sonnet xlix fair cruel why are you so fierce and cruel is it because your eyes have pour to kill then know that mercy is the mighty jewel and greater glory think to save then spill but i it be your pleasure and proud will to show the pour of your imperious eyes then not on him that never thought you ill but bend your force against your enemies let them eel utmost of your cruelties and kill with looks as cockatrices do but him that at your footstool humbled lies with merciful regard give mercy too such mercy shall you make admired to be so shall you live by giving life to me sonnet l. long languishing in double malady of my hearts wound and of my bodies grief there came to me a leach that would apply fit medicines for my bodies best relief vain man quod i that hast but little priee in deep discovery of the minds disease is not the heart of all the body chief and rules the members as it self does please then with some cordials seek first to appease the inward languour of my wounded heart and then my body shall have shortly ease but such sweet cordials pass physicians art then my lses leach do you your skill reveal and with one salve both heart and body heal sonnet li do i not see that fairest images of hardest marble are oh purpose made for that they should endure through many ages ne let their famous monuments to ade why then do i vntrainde in lovers trade her hardness blame which i should more commend sith never ought was excellent assayed which was not hard achieve and bring to end ne ought so hard but he that would attend mote soften it and to his will allue so do i hope her stubborn heart to bend and that it then more steadfast will endure only my pains will be the more to get her but having her my joy will be the greater sonnet lii so oft as homeward i from her depart i go like one that having lost the field is prisoner led away with heavy hat despoiled of warlike arms and known shield so do i now my self a prisoner yield to sorrow and to solitary pain from presence oh my dearest deer exylde long while alone in languor to remain there let no thought of joy or pleasure vain dare to approach that may my solace breed but sudden dumps and dreary sad disdain of all world's gladness more my torment feed so i hr absens will my penance make that of her presens i my meed may take sonnet liii the panther knowing that his spotted hide does please all beass but that his looks them ray within a bush his dreadful head does hide to let them gaze why lest he on them may pray right so my cruel fair with me does play for with the goodly semblant of her hw she does allure me to mine own decay and then no mercy will unto me show great shame it is thing so divine in view made for to be the world's most ornament to make the bait her gazers to embrew good shames to be to ill and instrument but mercy does with beauty best agree as in their maker you them best may see sonnet liiii of this world's theatre in which we stay my love like the spectator ydly sits beholding me that all the pageants play disguising diversely my troubled wits sometime i joy when glad occasion sits and mask in mirth like to a comedy soon after when my joy to sorrow flits i wail and make my woes a tragedy yet she beholding me with constant eye delights not in my mirth nor es my smart but when i laugh she mocks and when i cry she laughs and hardens evermore her heart what then ca move her if nor mirth nor moan she is no woman but a senseless stone sonnet lv so oft as i her beauty do behold and therewith do her cruelty compare i marvel of what substance was the mould the which her made atonce so cruel fair not earth for her high thoughts more heavenly are not water for her love does burn like fire not air for she is not so light or rare not fire for she does frieze with aint desire then needs another element inquire whereof she mote be made that is the sky for to the heaven her haughty looks aspire and eke her mind is pure immortal high then sith to heaven you likened are the best be like in mercy as in all the rest sonnet lvi fair you be sure but cruel and unkind as is a tiger that with greediness hunt's after blood

dreams nor dreadul ights make sudden sad affrights ne let house fires nor lightnings helpless harms ne let the ponke no other evil sprights ne let mischiuous witches with their charms ne let hob goblins names whose sense we see not fray us with things that be not let not the shriech oule nor the stork be herd nor the night raven that still deadly else nor damned ghosts called up with mighty spells nor grisly vultures make us once afeard ne let th ` unpleasant quire of fogs still croaking make us to wish their choking let none of these their dreary accents sing ne let the woods them answer nor their echo ring but let still silence true night watches keep that sacred peace may in assurance rain and timely sleep when it is time to sleep may ponre his limbs forth on your pleasant plain the while and hundred little winged loves like diverse feathered doves shall fly and flutter round about your bed and in the secret dark that none reproves their pretty stealths shall work & snares shall spread to filch away sweet snatches of delight concealed through covert night the sons of venus play your sports at will for greedy pleasure careless of your toys thinks more upon her

vvilliam ponsonby 1596. to the right honourable and most virtuous ladies the lady margaret countess of cumberland and the lady marry countess of warwicke having in the greener times of my youth composed these former two hymns in the praise of love and beauty and finding that the same too much pleased those of like age & disposition which being too vehemently carried with that kind of affection do rather suck out poison to their strong passion then honey to their honest delight i was moved by the one of you two most excellent ladies to call in the same but being unable so to do by reason that many copies thereof were formerly scattered abroad i resolved at least to amend and by way of retractation to reform them making in stead of those two hymns of earthly or natural love and beauty two others of heavenly and celestial the which i do dedicate jointly unto you two honourable sisters as to the most excellent and rare ornaments of all true love and beauty both in the one and the other kind humbly beseeching you to vouchsafe the patronage of them and to accept this my humble service in lieu of the great graces and honourable favours which you daily show unto me until such

most bounden ever in all humble service ed. sp. and hymne in honovr of love loue that long since haste to thy mighty pour perforce subdued my poor captived heart and raging now therein with restless stour dost tyrannise in every weaker part fain would i seek to ease my bitter smart by any service i might do to thee or ought that else might to thee pleasing bee and now assuage the force of this new flame and make thee more propitious in my need i mean to sing the praises of thy name and thy victorious conquests to aread by which thou madest many hearts to bleed of mighty victor's with wide wounds imbrued and by thy cruel darts to thee subdued only i fear my wits enfeebled late through the sharp sorrows which thou hast me bred should faint and words should fail me to relate the wondrous triumphs of thy great godhead but if thou wouldst vouchsafe to overspread me with the shadow of thy gentle wing i should enabled be thy acts to sing come then o come thou mighty god of love out of thy silver bowers and secret bliss where thou dost fit in venus lap above bathing thy wings in her ambrosial kiss that sweeter far then any nectar is come softly and my feeble breast inspire with gentle fury kindled of thy fire and you sweet muses which have often proved the piercing points of his avengeful darts and you fair nymph's which oftentimes have loved the cruel worker of your kindly smarts prepare your selves and open wide your hearts for to receive the triumph of your glory that made you merry oft when you were sorry and you fair blossoms of youths wanton breed which in the conquests of your beauty boast wherewith your lovers feeble eyes you feed but starve their hearts that needs nurture most prepare your selves to march among his host and all the way this sacred hymn do sing made in the honour of your sovereign king great god of might that reignest in the mind and all the body to thy hest dost frame victor of gods subduer of mankind that dost the lions and fell tigers tame making their cruel rage thy scornful game and in their roaring taking great delight who can express the glory of thy might or who alive can perfectly declare the wondrous cradle of thine infancy when thy great mother venus first thee bore begotten of plenty and of penury though elder then thine own nativity and yet a child renewing still thy years and yet the eldest of the heavenly pears for ere this world's still moving mighty mass out of great chaos ugly prison crept in which his goodly face long hidden was from heavens view and in deep darkness kept love that had now long time securely slept in venus lap unarmed then and naked gan rear his head by clotho being waked and taking to him wings of his own heat kindled at first from heavens life-giving fire he gan to move out of his idle seat weakly at first but after with desire lifted aloft he gan to mount up hire and like fresh eagle make his hardy flight through all that great wide waste yet wanting light yet wanting light to guide his wandering way his own fair mother for all creatures sake did lend him light from her own goodly ray then through the world his way he gan to take the world that was not till he did it make whose sundry parts he from them selves did sever the which before had lyen confused ever the earth the air the water and the fire then gan to range them selves in huge array and with contrary forces to conspire each against other by all means they may threatening their own confusion and decay air hated earth and water hatefyre till love relented their rebellious ire he then them took and tempering goodly well their contrary dislikes with loved means did place them all in order and compel to keep them selves within their sundry reins together linked with adamantine chains yet so as that in every living wight they mix themselves & show their kindly might so ever since they firmly have remained and duly well observed his behest through which now all these things that are contained within this goodly cope both most and lest their being have and daily are increased through secret sparks of his infused fire which in the barren cold he does inspire thereby they all do live and moved are to multiply the likeness of their kind whilst they seek only without further care to quench the flame which they in burning find but man that breathes a more immortal mind not for lustest sake but for eternity seeks to enlarge his lasting progeny for having yet in his deducted spright some sparks remaining of that heavenly fire he is enlumind with that goodly light unto like goodly semblant to aspire therefore in choice of love he does desire that seems on earth most heavenly to embrace that same is beauty born of heavenly raze for sure of all that in this mortal frame contained is nought more divine does seem or that resembles more th'immortall flame of heavenly light then beauty's glorious beam what wonder then if with such rage extreme frail men whose eyes seek heavenly things to see at sighed thereof so much enrauisht be which well perceiving that imperious boy does therewith tip his sharp empoisoned darts which glancing through the eyes with countenance coy rest not till they have pierced the trembling hearts and kindled flame in all their inner parts which sucks the blood and drinketh up the life of careful wretches with consuming grief thenceforth they plain & make full piteous moan unto the author of their baleful bane the days they waste the nights they grieve and groan their lives they loath and heavens light disdain no light but that whose lamp does yet remain fresh burning in the image of their eye they deign to see and seeing it still die the whilst thou tyrant love dost laugh & scorn at their complaints making their pain thy play whilst they lie languishing like thralls forlorn the whiles thou dost triumph in their decay and otherwhiles their dying to delay thou dost emmarble the proud heart of her whose love before their life they do prefer so hast thou often done ay me the more to me thy vassal whose yet bleeding heart with thousand wounds thou mangled haste so soar that whole remains scarce any little part yet to augment the anguish of my smart thou hast enfrosen her disdainful breast that no one drop of pity there does rest why then do i this honour unto thee thus to ennoble thy victorious name since thou dost show no favour unto me ne once move ruth in that rebellious dame somewhat to slack the rigour of my flame certes small glory dost thou win hereby to let her live thus free and me to die but if thou be indeed as men thee call the world's great parent the most kind preserver of living wights the sovereign lord of all how falls it then that with thy furious fervour thou dost afflict as well the not deserver as him that doth thy lovely hests despise and on thy subjects most dost tyrannise yet herein eke thy glory seems more by so hard handling those which best thee serve that ere thou dost them unto grace restore thou mayest well try if they will ever swerve and mayest them make it better to deserve and bauing god it may it more esteem for things hard got men more dearly deem so hard those heavenly beauty's be enfyred as things divine least passion do impress the more of steadfast minds to be admired the more they stayed be on steadfastness but baseborn minds such lamps regard the less which at first blowing take not hasty fire such fancies feel no love but lose desire for love is lord of truth and loyalty lifting himself out of the lowly dust on golden plumes up to the purest sky above the reach of loathly sinful lust whose base affect through cowardly distrust of his weak wings dare not to heaven fly but like a moldwarpe in the earth dothly his dunghill thoughts which do themselves enure to dirty dross no higher dare aspire ne can his feeble earthly eyes endure the flaming light of that celestial fire which kindleth love in generous desire and makes him mount above the native might of heavy earth up to the heavens hight such is the pour of that sweet passion that it all sordid baseness does expel and the refined mind does newly fashion unto a fairer form which now does dwell in his high thought that would it self excel which he beholding still with constant sighed admires the mirror of so heavenly light whose image printing in his deepest wit he thereon feeds his hungry fantasy still full yet never satisfied with it like tantale that in store does steruedly so does he pine in most satiety for nought may quench his infinite desire once kindled through that first conceived fire thereon his mind affixed wholly is ne thinks on ought but how it to attain his care his joy his hope is all on this that seems in it all blisses to contain in sighed whereof all other bliss seems vain thrice happy man might he the same possess he feigns himself and does his fortune bless and though he do not win his wish to end yet thus far happy he him self does ween that heavens such happy grace did to him lend as thing on earth so heavenly to have seen his hearts enshrined saint his heavens queen fairer then fairest in his feigning eye whose sole aspect he counts felicity then forth he casts in his unquiet thought what he may do her favour to obtain what brave exploit what peril hardly wrought what puissant conquest what aduenturons pain may please her best and grace unto him gain he dreads no danger nor misfortune fears his faith his fortune in his breast he bears thou art his god thou art his mighty guide thou being blind lettest him not see his fears but carriest him to that which he hath eyed through seas through flames through thousand swords and spears ne ought so strong that may his force withstand with which thou armest his resistless hand witness leander in the euxine waves and stout aeneas in the trojan fire achilles pressing through the phrygian glaives and orpheus daring to provoke the ire of damned fiends to get his love retire for both through heaven & hell thou makest way to win them worship which to thee obey and if by all these perils and these pains he may but purchase liking in her eye what heavens of joy then to himself he feigns eftsoons he wipes quite out of memory what ever ill before he did aby had it be death yet would he die again to live thus happy as her grace to gain yet when he hath found favour to his will he nathemore can so contented rest but forceth further on and strives still t'approch more near till in her inmost breast he may embosomd bee and loved best and yet not best but to be loved alone for love can not endure a paragon the fear whereof o how does it torment his troubled mind with more then hellish pain and to his feigning fausie represent sights never seen and thousand shadows vain to break his sleep and waste his idle brain thou that hast never loved canst not believe lest part of evils which poor lovers grieve the gnawing envy the heartfretting fear the vain surmizes the distrustful shows the false reports that flying tales do bear the doubts the dangers the delays the woes the feigned friends the unassured foes with thousands more then any tongue can tell do make a lovers life a wretches hell yet is there one more cursed then they all that cancer worm that monster jealousy which eats the heart and feeds upon the gall turning all loves delight to misery through fear of losing his felicity ah gods that ever you that monster placed in gentle love that all his joys defaced by these o love thou dost thy entrance make unto thy heaven and dost the more endear thy pleasures unto those which them partake as after storms when clouds begin to clear the sun more bright & glorious does appear so thou thy folk through pains of purgatory dost bear unto thy bliss and heavens glory there thou them placest in a paradise of all delight and joyous happy rest where they do feed on nectar heavenly wise with hercules and hebe and the rest of venus darlings through her bounty blessed and lie like gods in ivory beds arrayed with rose and lilies over them displayed there with thy daughter pleasure they do play their hurtless sports without rebuke or blame and in her snowy bosom boldly lay their quiet heads devoid of guilty shame after full joyance of their gentle game then her they crown their goddess and their queen and deck with flowers thy altars well beseen ay me deer lord that ever i might hope for all the pains and woes that i endure to come at length unto the wished scope of my desire or might my self assure that happy port for ever to recure then would i think these pains no pains at all and all my woes to be but penance small then would i sing of thine immortal praise and heavenly hymn such as the angels sing and thy triumphant name then would i raise above all the gods thee only honouring my guide my god my victor and my king till then dread lord vouchsafe to take of me this simple song thus framed in praise of thee finis and hymne in honovr of beavtie ah whither love wilt thou now carry me what wontless fury dost thou now inspire into my feeble breast too full of thee whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire thou in me kindlest much more great desire and up aloft above my strength dost raise the wondrous matter of my fire to praise that as i erst in praise of thine own name so now in honour of thy mother deer and honourable hymn i eke should frame and with the brightness of her beauty clear the ravished hearts of gazeful men might rear to admiration of that heavenly light from whence proceeds such foul enchanting might thereto do thou great goddess queen of beauty mother of love and of all world's delight without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sighed do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light tilluminate my dim and dulled eyes and beautify this sacred hymn of thine that both to thee to whom i mean it most and eke to her whose fair immortal beam hath darted fire into my feeble ghost that now it wasted is with woes extreme it may so please that she at length will stream some dew of grace into my withered heart after long sorrow and consuming smart what time this world's great workmaster did cast to make all things such as we now behold it seems that he before his eyes had placed a goodly pattern to whose perfect mould he fashioned them as comely as he could that now so fair and seemly they appear as nought may be amended any where that wondrous pattern wheresoever it be whither in earth laid up in secret store or else in heaven that no man may it see with sinful eyes for fear it to deflore is perfect beauty which all men adore whose face and feature does so much excel all mortal sense that none the same may tell thereof as every earthly thing partakes or more or less by influence divine so it more fair accordingly it makes and the gross matter of this earthly mine which clotheth it thereafter does refyne doing away the dross which dims the light of that fair beam which therein is empight for through infusion of celestial pour the duller earth it quickeneth with delight and life-full spirits privily does pour through all the parts that to the lookers sighed they seem to please that is thy sovereign might oh cyprian queen which flowing from the beam of thy bright star thou into them dost stream that is the thing which gives pleasant grace to all things fair that kindleth lively fire light of thy lamp which shining in the face thence to the soul darts amorous desire and robs the hearts of those which it admire therewith thou pointest thy sons poisoned arrow that wounds the life & wastes the inmost marrow how vainly then do idle wits invent that beauty is nought else but mixture made of colours fair and goodly temp'rament of pure complexions that shall quickly fade and pass away like to a summers shade or that it is but comely composition of parts well measured with meet disposition hath white and read in it such wondrous pour that it can pierce through eyes unto the heart and therein stir such rage and restless stour as nought but death can stint his dolours smart or can proportion of the outward part move such affection in the inward mind that it can rob both sense and reason blind why do not then the blossoms of the field which are arrayed with much more orient hew and to the sense most dainty odours yield work like impression in the lookers view or why do not fair pictures like pour show in which oftimes we nature see of art excelled in perfect limming every part but ah believe me there is more then so that works such wonders in the minds of men i that have often proved too well it know and who so list the like assays to ken shall find by trial and confess it then that beauty is not as found men misdeem and outward show of things that only seem for that same goodly hew of white and read with which the cheeks are sprinkled shall decay and those sweet rosy leaves so fairly spread upon the lips shall fade and fallen away to that they were even to corrupted clay that golden wire those sparkling stars so bright shall turn to dust and lose their goodly light but that fair lamp from whose celestial ray that light proceeds which kindleth lovers fire shall never be extinguished nor decay but when the vital spirits do expire unto her native planet shall retire for it is heavenly born and can not die being a parcel of the purest sky for when the soul the which derived was at first out of that great immortal spright by whom all live to love whilom did pass down from the top of purest heavens hight to be embodied here it then took light and lively spirits from that fairest star which lights the world forth from his firy car which pour retaining still or more or less when she in fleshly seed is est enraced through every part she does thee same impress according as the heavens have her graced and frames her house in which she will be placed fit for her self adorning it with spoil of heavenly riches which she robderewhyle thereof it comes that these fair souls which have the most resemblance of that heavenly light frame to themselves most beautiful and brave their fleshly bower most fit for their delight and the gross matter by a sovereign might tempers so trim that it may well be seen a palace fit for such a virgin queen so every spirit as it is most pure and hath in it the more of heavenly light so it the fairer body does procure to habit in and it more fairly dight with cheerful grace and amiable sighed for of the soul the body form does take for soul is form and does the body make therefore where ever that thou dost behold a comely corpse with beauty fair endued know this for certain that the same does hold a beauteous soul with fair conditions thewed fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed for all that fair is is by nature good that is a sign to know the gentle blood yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind dwells in deformed tabernacle drowned either by chance against the course of kind or through unaptness in the substance found which it assumed of some stubborn ground that will not yield unto her forms direction but is performed with some foul imperfection and oft it falls ay me the more to rew that goodly beauty albe heavenly born is foul abused and that celestial hew which does the world with her delight adorn made but the bait of sin and sinners scorn whilst every one does seek and sew to have it but every one does seek but to deprave it yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame but theirs that do abuse it unto ill nothing so good but that through guilty shame may be corrupt and wrested unto will natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still how ever fleshes fault it filthy make for things immortal no corruption take but you fair dams the world's deer ornaments and lively images of heavens light let not your beams with such disparagements be dimmed and your bright glory darkened quite but mindful still of your first countries sighed do still preserve your first informed grace whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face loath that foul blot that hellish fierbrand disloyal lust fair beauty's foulest blame that base affections which your ears would bland commend to you by loves abused name but is indeed the bondslave of defame which will the garland of your glory mar and quench the light of your bright shining star but gentle love that loyal is and true will more illumine your resplendent ray and add more brightness to your goodly hew from light of his pure fire which by like way kindled of yours your likeness does display like as two mirrors by opposed reflection do both express the faces first impression therefore to make your beauty more appear it you behooves to love and forth to lay that heavenly riches which in you you bear that men the more admire their fountain may for else what boots that celestial ray if it in darkness be enshrined ever that it of loving eyes be viewed never but in your choice of loves this well advise that likest to your selves you them select the which your forms first source may sympathise and with like beauty's parts be inly decked for if you loosely love without respect it is no love but a discordant war whose unlike parts among themselves do jar for love is a celestial harmony of likely hearts composed of stars concent which join together in sweet sympathy to work each others joy and true content which they have harboured since their first descent out of their heavenly bowers where they did see and know each other here beloved to be then wrong it were that any other twaine should in loves gentle band combined be but those whom heaven did at first ordain and made out of one mould the more agree for all that like the beauty which they see straight do not love for love is not so light as straight to burn at first beholders sighed but they which love indeed look otherwise with pure regard and spotless true intent drawing out of the object of their eyes a more refined form which they present unto their mind void of all blemishment which it reducing to her first perfection beholdeth free from fleshes frail infection and then conforming it unto the light which in it self it hath remaining still of that first sun yet sparkling in his sighed thereof he fashions in his higher skill and heavenly beauty to his fancies will and it embracing in his mind entire the mirror of his own thought does admire which seeing now so inly fair to be as outward it appears to the eye and with his spirits proportion to agree he thereon fixeth all his fantasy and fully sets his felicity counting it fairer then it is indeed and yet indeed her fairness does exceed for lovers eyes more sharply sighted be then other men's and in deer loves delight see more then any other eyes can see through mutual receipt of beams bright which carry privy message to the spright and to their eyes that inmost fair display as plain as light discovers dawning day therein they see through amorous eye-glaunces armies of loves still flying too and from which dart at them their little fiery lances whom having wounded back again they go carrying compassion to their lovely foe who seeing her fair eyes so sharp effect cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect in which how many wonders do they reed to their conceit that others never see now of her smiles with which their souls they feed like gods with nectar in their banquets free now of her looks which like to cordials be but when her words embassade forth she sends lord how sweet music that unto them lends sometime upon her forehead they behold a thousand graces masking in delight sometime within her eyelids they unfold ten thousand sweet belgard's which to their sighed do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night but on her lips like rosy buds in may so many millions of chaste pleasures play all those o cytherea and thousands more thy handmaidens be which do on thee attend to deck thy beauty with their dainties store that may it more to mortal eyes commend and make it more admired of foe and friend that in men's hearts thou mayest thy throne enstall and spread thy lovely kingdom over all then iotryumph o great beauty's queen advance the banner of thy conquest high that all this world the which thy vassals been may draw to thee and with due fealty adore the pour of thy great majesty singing this hymn in honour of thy name compiled by me which thy poor liegeman am in lieu whereof grant o great sovereign that she whose conquering beauty does captive my trembling heart in her eternal chain one drop of grace at length will to me give that i her bounden thrall by her may live and this same life which first from me she reaved may owe to her of whom i it received and you fair venus darling my deer dread fresh flower of grace great goddess of my life when your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read deign to let fallen one drop of due relief that may recure my hearts long pining grief and show what wondrous pour your beauty hath that can restore a damned wight from death finis and hymne of heavenly love loue lift me up upon thy golden wings from this base world unto thy heavens hight where i may see those admirable things which there thou workest by thy sovereign might far above feeble reach of earthly sighed that i thereof and heavenly hymn may sing unto the god of love high heavens king many lewd lays ah woe is me the more in praise of that mad fit which fools call love i have in th'heat of youth made heretofore that in light wits did lose affection move but all those follies now i do reprove and turned have the tenor of my string the heavenly praises of true love to sing and you that wont with greedy vain desire to read my fault and wondering at my flame to warm your selves at my wide sparkling fire sith now that heat is quenched quench my blame and in her ashes shroud my dying shame for who my passed follies now pursues begins his own and my old fault renews before this world's great frame in which all things are now contained found any being place ere flitting time could wag his eyas wings about that mighty bound which does embrace the rolling spheres & parts their hours by space that high eternal pour which now does move in all these things moved in it self by love it loved it self because it self was fair for fair is loved and of it self begotten like to it self his eldest son and heir eternal pure and void of sinful blot the firstling of his joy in whom no jot of loves dislike or pride was to be found whom he therefore with equal honour crowned with him he reigned before all time prescribed in endless glory and immortal might together with that third from them derived most wise most holy most almighty spright whose kingdoms throne no thought of earthly wight can comprehend much less my trembling verse with equal words can hope it to rehearse yet o most blessed spirit pure lamp of light eternal spring of grace and wisdom true vouchsafe to shed into my barren spright some little drop of thy celestial due that may my rhymes with sweet infuse embrew and give me words equal unto my thought to tell the marvels by thy mercy wrought yet being pregnant still with powerful grace and full of fruitful love that loves to get things like himself and to enlarge his raze his second brood though not in pour so great yet full of beauty next he did beget and infinite increase of angels bright all glistering glorious in their makers light to them the heavens illimitable hight not this round heaven which we from hence behold adorned with thousand lamps of burning light and with ten thousand gems of shining gold he gave as their inheritance to hold that they might serve him in eternal bliss and be partakers of those joys of his there they in their trinal triplicities about him wait and on his will depend either with nimble wings to cut the skies when he them on his messages does send or on his own dread presence to attend where they behold the glory of his light and carol hymns of love both day and night both day and night is unto them all one for he his beams does still to them extend that darkness there appears never none ne hath their day ne hath their bliss and end but there their termelesse time in pleasure spend ne ever should their happiness decay had not they dared their lord to disobey but pride impatient of long resting peace did puff them up with greedy bold ambition that they gan cast their state how to increase above the fortune of their first condition and fit in gods own seat without commission the brightest angel even the child of light drew millions more against their god to fight th'almighty seeing their so bold assay kindled the flame of his consuming ire and with his only breath them blew away from heavens hight to which they did aspire to deepest hell and lake of damned fire where they in darkness and dread horror dwell hating the happy light from which they fell so that next offspring of the makers love next to himself in glorious degree degendering to hate fell from above through pride for pride and love may ill agree and now of sin to all ensample be how then can sinful flesh it self assure sith purest angels fell to be impure but that eternal fount of love and grace still flowing forth his goodness unto all now seeing left a waste and empty place in his wide palace through those angels fallen cast to supply the same and to enstall a new unknown colony therein whose root from earth's base groundwork should begin therefore of clay base vile and next to nought yet formed by wondrous skill and by his might according to and heavenly pattern wrought which he had fashioned in his wise foresight he man did make and breathed a living spright into his face most beautiful and fair endued with wifedomes riches heavenly rare such he him made that he resemble might himself as mortal thing immortal could him to be lord of every living wight he made by love out of his own like mould in whom he might his mighty self behold for love does love the thing beloved to see that like it self in lovely shape may be but man forgetful of his makers grace no less then angels whom he did ensue fell from the hope of promised heavenly place into the mouth of death to sinners due and all his offspring into thraldom threw where they for ever should in bonds remain of never dead yet ever dying pain till that great lord of love which him at first made of mere love and after liked well seeing him lie like creature long accursed in that deep horror of despair hell him wretch in dole would let no longer dwell but cast out of that bondage to redeem and pay the price all were his debt extreme out of the bosom of eternal bliss in which he reigned with his glorious sire he down descended like a most demisse and abject thrall in fleshes frail attire that he for him might pay sins deadly hire and him restore unto that happy state in which he stood before his hapless fate in flesh at first the guilt committed was therefore in flesh it must be satisfied nor spirit nor angel though they man surpass could make amends to god for men misguide but only man himself who self did slide so taking flesh of sacred virgins womb for men deer sake he did a man become and that most blessed body which was born without all blemish or reproachful blame he freely gave to be both rend and torn of cruel hands who with despiteful shame reuyling him that them most vile became at length him nailed on a gallow tree and slew the just by most unjust decree o huge and most unspeakable impression of loves deep wound that pierced the piteous heart of that deer lord with so entire affection and sharply launching every inner part dolours of death into his soul did dart doing him die that never it deserved to free his foes that from his hest had swerved what heart can feel least touch of so soar launch or thought can think the depth of so deer wound whose bleeding source their streams yet never staunch but still do flow & freshly still redound to heal the sores of sinful souls unsound and cleanse the guilt of that infected crime which was enrooted in all fleshly slime o blessed well of love o flower of grace oh glorious morning star o lamp of light most lively image of thy father's face eternal king of glory lord of might meek lamb of god before all world's behight how can we thee requite for all this good or what can prize that thy most precious blood yet nought thou askest in lieu of all this love but love of us for guerdon of thy pain ay me what can us less then that behone had he required life of us again had it been wrong to ask his own with gain he gave us life he it restored lost then life were least that us so little cost but he our life hath left unto us free free that was thrall and blessed that was band ne ought demands but that we loving bee as he himself hath loved us afore hand and bound thereto with and eternal band him first to love that us so dearly bought and next our brothers to his image wrought him first to love great right and reason is who first to us our life and being gave and after when we fared had amiss us wretches from the second death did save and last the food of life which now we have even himself in his deer sacrament to feed our hungry souls unto us lent then next to love our brothers that were made of that self mould and that self makers hand that we and to the same again shall fade where they shall have like heritage of land how ever here on higher steps we stand which also were with self same price redeemed that we how ever of us light esteemed and were they not yet since that loving lord commanded us to love them for his sake even for his sake and for his sacred word which in his last bequest he to us spoke we should them love & with their needs partake knowing that whatsoever to them we give we give to him by whom we all do live such mercy he by his most holy reed unto us taught and to approve it true ensampled it by his most righteous deed showing us mercy miserable crew that we the like should to the wretches show and love our brothers thereby to approve how much himself that loved us we love then rouse thy self o earth out of thy soil in which thou wallowest like to filthy swine and dost thy mind in dirty pleasures

encradled was in simple cratch wrapped in a would of hay between the toylefull ox and humble ass and in what rags and in how base array the glory of our heavenly riches lay when him the silly shepherds came to see whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee from thence read on the story of his life his humble carriage his unfaulty ways his cankered foes his fights his toil his strife his pains his poverty his sharp assays through which he passed his miserable days offending none and doing good to all yet being malist both of great and small and look at last how of most wretched wights he taken was betrayed and false accused how with most scornful taunts & fell despites bruised he was reviled disgraced and foul abused how scourged how crowned how buffeted how & side and lastly how betwixt robbers crucifyde with bitter wounds through hands through feet then let thy flinty heart that feels no pain empierced be with pitiful remorse and let thy bowels bleed in every vain at sighed of his most sacred heavenly corpse so torn and mangled with malicious force and let thy soul whose sins his sorrows wrought melt into tears and groan in grieved thought with sense whereof whilst so thy softened spirit is inly touched and humbled with meek zeal through meditation of his endless merit lift up thy mind to author of thy weal and to his sovereign mercy do appeal learn him to love that loved thee so deer and in thy breast his blessed image bear with all thy heart with all thy soul and mind thou must him love and his behests embrace all other loves with which the world does blind weak fancies and stir up affections base thou must renounce and utterly displace and give thy self unto him full and free that full and freely gave himself to thee then shalt thou feel thy spirit so possessed and ravished with devouring great desire of his deer self that shall thy feeble breast inflame with love and set thee all on fire with burning zeal through every part entire that in no earthly thing thou shalt delight but in his sweet and amiable sighed thenceforth all world's desire will in thee die and all earth's glory on which men do gaze seem dirt and dross in thy pure sighted eye compared to that celestial beauty's blaze whose glorious beams all fleshly sense does daze with admiration of their passing light blinding the eyes and lumining the spright then shall thy ravished soul inspired be with heavenly thoughts far above humane skill and thy bright radiant eyes shall plainly see th'idee of his pure glory present still before thy face that all thy spirits shall fill with sweet enragement of celestial love kindled through sighed of those fair things above finis and hymne of heavenly beavtie rapt with the rage of mine own ravished thought through contemplation of those goodly sights and glorious images in heaven wrought whose wondrous beauty breathing sweet delights do kindle love in high conceited sprights i feign to tell the things that i behold but feel my wits to fail and tongue to fold vouchsafe then o thou most almighty spright from whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow to shed into my breast some sparkling light of thine eternal truth that i may show some little beams to mortal eyes below of that immortal beauty there with thee which in my weak distraughted mind i see that with the glory of so goodly sighed the hearts of men which fondly here admire fair seeming shows and feed on vain delight transported with celestial desire of those fair forms may lift themselves up high and learn to love with zealous humble duty th'eternall fountain of that heavenly beauty beginning then below with th'easie view of this base world subiectro fleshly eye from thence to mount aloft by order due to contemplation of th'immortall sky of the soar falcon so i learn to fly that flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath till she her self for stronger flight can breath then look who list thy gazeful eyes to feed with sighed of that is fair look on the frame of this wide universe and therein reed the endless kinds of creatures which by name thou canst not count much less their nature's aim all which are made with wondrous wise respect and all with admirable beauty decked first earth on adamantine pillars founded amid the sea engirded with brazen bans then th'aire still flitting but yet firmly bounded on every side with piles of flaming brands never consumed nor quenched with mortal hands and last that mighty shining crystal wall wherewith he hath encompassed this all. by view whereof it plainly may appear that still as every thing does upward tend and further is from earth so still more clear and fair it grows till to his perfect end of purest beauty it at last ascend air more then water fire much more then air and heaven then fire appears more pure & fair look thou no further but affix thine eye on that bright shiny round still moving mass the house of blessed gods which men call sky all sowd with glistering stars more thick them grass whereof each other does in brightness pass but those two most which ruling night and day as king and queen the heavens empire sway and tell me then what hast thou ever seen that to their beauty may compared be or can the sighed that is most sharp and keen endure their captains flaming head to see how much less those much higher in degree and so much fairer and much more then these as these are fairer then the land and seas for far above these heavens which here we see be others far exceeding these in light not bounded not corrupt as these same be but infinite in largeness and in hight unmoving uncorrupt and spotless bright that need no sun t'illuminate their spheres but their own native light far passing theirs and as these heavens still by degrees arise until they come to their first movers bound that in his mighty compass does comprise and carry all the rest with him around so those likewise do by degrees redound and rise more fair till they at last arrive to the most fair whereto they all do strive fair is the heaven where happy souls have place in full enjoyment of felicity whence they do still behold the glorious face of the divine eternal majesty more fair is that where those idees on high enranged be which plato so admired and pure intelligences from god inspired yet fairer is that heaven in w hich do rain the sovereign powers and mighty potentates which in their high protections do contain all mortal princes and imperial states and fairer yet whereas the royal seats and heavenly dominations are set from whom all earthly governance is fetched yet far more fair be those bright cherubins which all with golden wings are overdight and those eternal burning seraphins which from their faces dart out fiery light yet fairer then they both and much more bright be th'angels and archangels which attend on gods own person without rest or end these thus in fair each other far excelling as to the highest they approach more near yet is that highest far beyond all telling fairer then all the rest which there appear though all their beauty's joined together were how then can mortal tongue hope to express the image of such endless perfectness cease then my tongue and lend unto my mind leave to bethink how great that beauty is whose utmost parts so beautiful i find how much more those essential parts of his his truth his love his wisdom and his bliss his grace his doom his mercy and his might by which he lends us of himself a sighed those unto all he daily does display and show himself in th'image of his grace as in a looking glass through which he may be seen of all his creatures vile and base that are unable else to see his face his glorious face which glistereth else so bright that th'angels selves can not endure his sighed but we frail wights whose sighed cannot sustain the suns bright beams when he on us does shine but that their points rebutted back again are dulled how can we see with feeble eyes the glory of that majesty divine in sighed of whom both sun and moon are dark compared to his least resplendent spark the means therefore which unto us is lent him to behold is on his works to look which he hath made in beauty excellent and in the same as in a brazen book to read enregistered in every nook his goodness which his beauty does declare for all thats good is beautiful and fair thenee gathering plumes of perfect speculation to imp the wings of thy high flying mind mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation from this dark world whose damps the soul do blind and like the native brood of eagles kind on that bright sun of glory fix thine eyes cleared from gross mists of frail infirmities humbled with fear and awful reverence before the footstool of his majesty throw thy self down with trembling innocence ne dare look up with corruptible eye on the dreaded face of that great deity for fear lest if he chance to look on thee thou turn to nought and quite confounded be but lowly fallen before his mercy seat close covered with the lambs integrity from the iustwrath of his avengeful threat that sits upon the righteous throne on high his throne is built upon eternity more firm and durable then steel or brass or the hard diamond which them both does pass his sceptre is the rod of righteousness with which he bruiseth all his foes to dust and the great dragon strongly does repress under the rigour of his judgement just his seat is truth to which the faithful trust from whence proceed her beams so pure & bright that all about him sheds glorious light light far exceeding that bright blazing spark which darted is from titans flaming head that with his beams enlumineth the dark the dark & dampish air whereby all things are read whose nature yet so much is marveled of mortal wits that it does much amaze the greatest wizards which thereon do gaze but that immortal light which there does shine is many thousand times more clear more excellent more glorious more divine through which to god all mortal actions here and even the thoughts of men do plain appear for from th'eternall truth it does proceed through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed with the great glory of that wondrous light his throne is all encompassed around and hid in his own brightness from the sighed of all that look thereon with eyes unsound and underneath his feet are to be found thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire the instruments of his avenging ire there in his bosom sapience does fit the sovereign darling of the deity clad like a queen in royal robes most fit for so great pour and peerless majesty and all with gems and jewels gorgeously adorned that brighter then the stars appear and make her native brightness seem more clear and on her head a crown of purest gold is set in sign of highest sovereignty and in her hand a sceptre she does hold with which she rules the house of god on high and menageth the ever-moving sky and in the same these lower creatures all subjected to her pour imperial both he aven and earth obey unto her will and all the creatures which they both contain for of her fullness which the world does fill they all partake and do in state remain as their great maker did at first ordain through observation of her high behest by which they first were made and still increased the fairness of her face no tongue can tell for she the daughters of all women's raze and angels eke in beauty does excel sparkled on her from gods own glorious face and more increased by her own goodly grace that it does far exceed all humane thought ne can on earth compared be to ought ne could that painter had he lived yet which pictured venus with so curious quill that all posterity admired it have portrayed this for all his mastering skill ne she her self had she remained still and were as fair as fabling wits do fain could once come near this beauty sovereign but had those wits the wonders of their days or that sweet teian poet which did spend his plenteous vain in setting forth her praise seen but a glims of this which i pretend how wondrously would he her face commend above that idol of his feigning thought that all the world should with his rhymes be fraught how then dare i the novice of his art presume to picture so divine a wight or hope express her least perfections part whose beauty fills the heavens with her light and darks the earth with shadow of her sighed ah gentle muse thou art too weak and faint the portrait of so heavenly hew to paint let angels which her goodly face behold and see at will her sovereign praises sing and those most facred mysteries unfold of that fair love of mighty heavens king enough is me admire so heavenly thing and being thus with her huge love possessed in only wonder of her self to rest but who so may thrice happy man him hold of all on earth whom god so much does grace and lets his own beloved to behold for in the view of her celestial face all joy all bliss all happiness have place ne ought on earth can want unto the wight who of her self can win the wishful sighed for she out of her secret treasury plenty of riches forth on him will pour even heavenly riches which there hidden lie within the closet of her chastest bower th'eternall portion of her precious dowry which mighty god hath given to her free and to all those which thereof worthy be none thereof worthy be but those whom she vouchsafeth to her presence to receive and lets them her lovely face to see whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive and sweet contentment that it does bereave their soul of sense through infinite delight and them transport from flesh into the spright in which they see such admirable things as carries them into and ecstasy and hear such heavenly notes and carolings of gods high praise that fills the brazen sky and feel such joy and pleasure inwardly that makes them all worldly cares forget and only think on that before them set ne from thenceforth does any fleshly sense or idle thought of earthly things remain but all that erst seemed sweet seems now offence and all that pleased erst now seems to pain their joy their comfort their desire their gain is fixed all on that which now they see all other sights but feigned shadows be and that fair lamp which uses to inflame the hearts of men with self consuming fire thenceforth seems fowl & full of sinful blame and all that pomp to which proud minds aspire by name of honour and so much desire seems to them baseness and all riches dross and all mirth sadness and all lucre loss so full their eyes are of that glorious sighed and senses fraught with such satiety that in nought else on earth they can delight but in th'aspect of that felicity which they have written in their inward ey on which they feed and in their fastened mind all happy joy and full contentment find ah then my hungry soul which long hast fed on idle fancies of thy foolish thought and with false beauty's flattering bait misled hast after vain deceitful shadows sought which all are fled and now have left thee nought but late repentance through thy follies brief ah cease to gaze no matter of thy grief and look at last up to that sovereign light from whose pure beams alperfect beauty springs that kindleth love in every godly spright even the love of god which loathing brings of this vile world and these gay seeming things with whose sweet pleasures being so possessed thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest daphnaida and elegie upon the death of the noble and vertvovs dovglas howard daughter and heir of henry lord howard viscount byndon and wife of arthur gorges esquire dedicated to the right honourable the lady helena marquess of northampton by ed. sp. anchora spei at london printed for william ponsonby 1596. to the right honourable and virtuous lady helena marquess of northampton i have the rather presumed humbly to offer unto your honour the dedication of this little poëme for that the noble and virtuous gentlewoman of whom it is written was by match near allied and in affection greatly devoted unto your ladyship the occasion why i wrote the same was aswell the great good fame which i herd of her deceased as the particular good will which i bear unto her husband master arthur gorges a lover of learning and virtue whose house as your ladyship by marriage hath honoured so do i find the name of them by many notable records to be of great antiquity in this realm and such as have ever born themselves with honoarable reputation to the world & unspotted loyalty to their prince and country beside so lineally are they descended from the howards as that the lady anne howard eldest daughter to iohn duke of norfolke was wife to sir edmund mother to sir edward and grandmother to sir william and sir thomas gorges knights and therefore i do assure my self that no due honour done to the white lion but will be most grateful to your ladyship whose husband and children do so nearly participate with the blood of that noble family so in all duty i recommend this pamphlet and the good acceptance thereof to your honourable favour and protection london this first of ianuarie 1591. your honours humbly ever ed. sp. daphnaida what ever man he be whose heavy mind with grief of mournful great mishap oppressed fit matter for his cares increase would find let read the rueful plaint herein expressed of one i ween the wofulst man alive even sad alcyon whose empierced breast sharp sorrow did in thousand pieces rive but who so else in pleasure finds sense or in this wretched life doth take delight let him be banished far away from hence ne let the sacred sisters here be hight though they of sorrow heavily can sing for even their heavy song would breed delight but here no tunes save sobs and groans shall ring in stead of them and their sweet harmony let those three fatal sisters whose sad bans do weave the direful threads of destiny and in their wrath break off the vital bans approach hereto and let the dreadful queen of darkness deep come from the stygian strands and grisly ghosts to hear this doleful teen in gloomy evening when the weary sun after his days long labour drew to rest and sweaty steeds now having over run the compassed sky gan water in the west i walked abroad to breath the freshing air in open fields whose flowering pride oppressed with early frosts had lost their beauty fair there came unto my mind a troublous thought which daily does my weaker wit possess ne lets it rest until it forth have brought her long born infant fruit of heaviness which she conceived hath through meditation of this world's vainness and life's wretchedness that yet my soul it deeply does empassion so as i mused on the misery in which men live and i of many most most miserable man i did espy where towards me a sorry wight did cost clad all in black that mourning did bewray and iaakob staff in hand devoutly crossed like to some pilgrim come from far away his careless locks uncombed and unshorn hung long adown and beard all over grown that well he seemed to be some wight forlorn down to the earth his heavy eyes were thrown as loathing light and ever as he went he sighed soft and inly deep did groan as if his heart in pieces would have rend approaching nigh his face i viewed never and by the semblant of his countenance me seemed i had his person seen else where most like alcyon seeming at a glance alcyon he the jolly shepherd swain that wont full merrily to pipe and dance and fill with pleasance every wood and plain yet half in doubt because of his disguise i softly said alcyon there withal he looked a side as in disdainful wise yet stayed not till i again did call then turning back he said with hollow found who is it that doth name me woeful thrall the wretchedest man that treads this day on ground one whom like wofulnesse impressed deep hath made fit mate thy wretched case to hear and given like cause with thee to wail and weep grief finds some ease by him that like does bear then stay alcyon gentle shepherd stay quoth i till thou have to my trusty care committed what thee doth so ill apay cease foolish man said he half wrothfully to seek to hear that which cannot be told for the huge anguish which doth multiply my dying pains no tongue can well unfold ne do i care that any should bemoan my hard mishap or any weep that would but seek alone to weep and die alone then be it so quoth i that thou art bent to die alone unpitied unplained yet ere thou die it were convenient to tell the cause which thee thereto constrained lest that the world thee dead accuse of guilt and say when thou of none shalt be maintained that thou for secret crime thy blood hast spilled who life does loath and longs to be unbound from the strong shackles of frail flesh quoth he nought cares at all what they that live on ground deem the occasion of his death to be rather desires to be forgotten quite than question made of his calamity for hearts deep sorrow hates both life and light yet since so much thou seemest to rue my grief and carest for one that for himself cares nought sign of thy love though nought for my relief for my relief exceeds living thought i will to thee this heavy case relate then harken well till it to end be brought for never didst thou hear more hapless fate whilom ivsde as thou right well dost know my little flock on western downs to keep not far from whence sabrinaes stream does flow and flowery banks with silver liquour steep nought card i then for worldly change or chance for all my joy was on my gentle sheep and to my pipe to carol and to dance it there befell as i the fields did range fearless and free a fair young lioness white as the native rose before the change which venus blood did in her leaves impress i spied playing on the grassy plain her youthful sports and kindly wantonness that did all other beasts in beauty stain much was i moved at so goodly sighed whose like before mine eye had seldom seen and gan to cast how i her compass might and bring to hand that yet had never been so well i wrought with mildness and with pain that i her caught disporting on the green and brought away fast bound with silver chain and afterwards i handled her so sayre that though by kind she stout and salvage were for being born and ancient lions hair and of the raze that all wild beasts do fear yet i her framed and wanso to my bent that she became so meek and mild of cheer as the least lamb in all my flock that went for she in field where ever i did weened would weened with me and wait by me all day and all the night that i in watch did spend if cause required or else in sleep if nay she would all night by me or watch or sleep and evermore when i did sleep or play she of my flock would take full wary keep safe then and safest were my filly she epe ne feared the wolf ne feared the wildest beast all were i drowned in carelessequiet deep my loucly lionosse without behest so careful was for them and for my good thta when i waked neither most nor lest i found miscarried or in plain or wood oft did the shepheatils which my hap did hear and oft their lasses which my lack envied daily resort to my from far and near to see my lioness whose prailes wide where spread abroad and when her worthiness much greater than the rude report they tried they her did praise and my good fortune bless long thus lioyed in my happiness and well did hope my joy would have no end but o found man that in world's fickleness reposedst hope or weenedest her thy friend that glories most in mortal misery's and daily does her changeful counfels bend to make new matter fit for tragedies for whilst i was thus without dread or doubt a cruel satire with his murderous dart greedy of mischief ranging all about gave her the fatal wound of deadly smart and reft from me my sweet companion and reft from me my love my life my heart my lioness and woe is me is gone out of the world thus was she reft away out of the world unworthy such a spoil and born to heaven for he aven a fitter pray much fitter than the lion which with toil alcides slew and fixed in firmament her now i seek throughout this earthly soil and seeking miss and missing do lament therewith he gan afresh to wail and weep that i for pity of his heavy plighted could not abstain mine eyes with tears to steep but when i saw the anguish of his spright some deal alaid i him bespoke again certes alcyon painful is thy plighted that it in me breeds almost equal pain yet does not my dull wit well understand the riddle of thy loved lioness for rare it seems in reason to be skand that man who does the whole world's rule possess should to a beast his noble heart embase and be the vassal of his vassalesse therefore more plain aread this doubtful case then sighing soar daphne thou knewest quoth he she now is dead ne more endured to say but fell to ground for great extremity that i beholding it with deep dismay was much paid and lightly him uprearing revoked life that would have fled away all were my self through grief in deadly drearing then gan i him to comfort all my best and with mild counsel strove to mitigate the stormy passion of his troubled breast but he thereby was more empassionate as stubborn steed that is with curb restrained becomes more fierce and fervent in his gate and breaking forth at last thus dearnely plained 1 what man henceforth that breathes vital air will honour heaven or heavenly powers adore which so unjustly do their judgements share amongst earthly wights as to afflict so soar the innocent as those which do transgress and do not spare the best or fairest more than worst or foulest but do both oppress if this be right why did they then create the world so fair sith fairness is neglected or why be they themselves immaculate if purest things be not by them respected she fair she pure most fair most pure she was yet was by them as thing impure rejected yet she in pureness heaven it self did pass in pureness and in all celestial grace that men admire in goodly womankind she did excel and seemed of angels raze living on earth like angel new diuinde adorned with wisdom and with chastity and all the dowries of a noble mind which did her beauty much more beautify no age hath bred since fair astraea left the sinful world more virtue in a wight and when she parted hence with her she reft great hope and robbed her raze of bounty quite well may the shepherd lasses now lament for double loss by her hath on them light to lose both her and bounties omament ne let elisa royal shepherdess the praises of my parted love envy for she hath praises in all plenteousness poured upon her like showers of castaly by her own shepherd colin her own shepherd that her with heavenly hymns does deify of rustic muse full hardly to be bettered she is the rose the glory of the day and mine the primrose in the lowly shade mine ah not mine amiss i mine did say not mine but his which mine a while her made mine to be his with him to live for ay oh that so fair a flower so soon should fade and through untimely tempest fallen away she fell away in her first ages spring while yet her leaf was green & fresh her rind and while her branch fair blossoms forth did bring she fell away against all course of kind for age to die is right but youth is wrong she fell away like fruit blown down with wind weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 2 what heart so stony hard but that would weep and pour forth fountains of incessant tears what timon but would let compassion creep into his breast and pierce his frozen ears in stead of tears whose brackish bitter well i wasted have my heart blood dropping wears to think to ground how that fair blossom fell yet fell she not as one inforced to die ne died with dread and grudging discontent but as one toiled with travel down does lie so lay she down as if to fleepe she went and closed her eyes with careless quiemesse the while soft death away her spirit hent and soul assoiled from sinful fleshliness yet ere that life her lodging did forsake she all resolved and ready to remone calling to me ay me this wise bespoke alcyon ah my first and latest lone ah why does my alcyon weep and mourn and grieve my ghost that ill more him behoove as if to me had chanced some evil turn i since the messenger is come for me that summons souls unto the bridal feast of his great lord must needs depart from thee and straight obey his soneraine behest why should alcyon then so soar lament that i from misery shall be released and freed from wretched long imprisonment our days are full of dolour and disease our life afflicted with incessant pain that nought on earth may lessen or appease why then should i desire here to remain or why should he that loves me sorry bee for my deliverance or at all complain my good to hear and towards joys to see i go and long desired have to go i go with gladness to my wished rest whereas no world's sad care nor wasting woe may come their happy quiet to molest but saints and angels in celestial thrones eternally him praise that hath them blessed there shall i be among those blessed ones yet ere i go a pledge i leave with thee of the late love the which betwixt us passed my young ambrosia in lieu of me love her so shall our love for ever last thus deer adieu whom i expect ere long so having said away she softly passed weep shepherd weep to make mine undersong 3 so oft as i record those piercing words which yet are deep engraved in my breast and those last deadly accents which like swords did wound my heart and rend my bleeding chest with those sweet sugared speeches do compare the which my soul first conquered and possessed the first beginners of my endless care and when those pallid cheeks and ashy hew in which sad death his portraiture had writ and when those hollow eyes and deadly view on which the cloud of ghastly night did fit i match with that sweet smile and cheerful brow which all the world subdued unto it how happy was i then and wretched now how happy was i when i saw her lead the shepherds daughters dancing in around how trimly would she trace and softly tread the tender grass with rosy garland crowned and when she list advance her heavenly voice both nymphs & muses nigh she made astounded and flocks and shepherds caused to rejoice but now you shepherd lasses who shall led your wandering troops or sing your virelays or who shall dight your bowers sith she is dead that was the lady of your holy days let now your bliss be turned into bale and into plaints convert your joyous plays and with the same fill every hill and dale let bagpipe never more be herd to shrill that may allure the senses to delight ne ever shepherd found his oaten quill unto the many that provoke them might to idle pleasance but let ghastliness and dreary horror dim the cheerful light to make the image of true heaviness let birds be silent on the naked spray and shady woods resound with dreadful yells let streaming floods their hasty courses stay and parching drouth dry up the crystal wells let earth be barren and bring forth no flowers and the be filled with noise of doleful knells and wandering spirits walk untimely hours and nature nurse of every living thing let rest her self from her long weariness and cease henceforth things kindly forth to bring but hideous monsters full of ugliness for she it is that hath me done this wrong no nurse but stepdame cruel merciless weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 4 my little flock whom erst i loved so well and wont to feed with finest grass that grew feed you henceforth on bitter astrofell and stinking smallage and unsavoury rew and when your maws are with those weeds corrupted be you the prey of wolves ne will i rew that with your carcases wild beasts be glutted ne worse to you my silly sheep i pray ne sorer vengeance wish on you to fallen than to my self for whose confused decay to careless heavens i do daily call but heavens refuse to hear a wretches cry and cruel death does scorn to come at call or grant his boon that most desires to die the good and righteous he away does take to plague unrighteous which alive remain but the ungodly ones he does forsake by living long to multiply their pain else surely death should be no punishment as the great judge at first did it ordain but rather riddance from long languishment therefore my daphne they have taken away for worthy of a better place was she but me unworthy willed here to stay that with her lack i might tormented be sith then they so have ordered i will pay penance to her according their decree and to her ghost do service day by day for i will walk this wandering pilgrimage throuhout the world from one to other end and in affliction waste my better age my bred shall be the anguish of my mind my drink the tears which from mine eyes do rain my bed the ground that hardest i may find so will i wilfully increase my pain and the my love that was my saint that is when she beholds from her celestial throne in which she joyeth in eternal bliss my bitter penance will my cafe bemoan and pity me that living thus do die for heavenly spirits have compassion on mortal men and rue their misery so when i have with sorrow satisfied importune fates which vengeance on me seek and th'eauens with long languor pacified she for pure pity of my sufferance mecke will send for me for which i daily long and will tell then my painful penance ecke weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 5 henceforth i hate what ever nature made and in her workmanship no pleasure find for they be all but vain and quickly fade so soon as on them blows the northern wind they tarry not but flit and fallen away leaving behind them nought but grief of mind and mocking such as think they long will stay i hate the heaven because it does withhold me from my love and eke my love from me i hate the earth because it is the mould of fleshly slime and frail mortality i hate the fire because to nought it flies i hate the air because fighes of it be i hate the sea because it tears supplies i hate the day because it dares light to see all things and not my love to see i hate the darkness and the dreary night because they breed sad balefulness in me i hate all times because all times do fly so fast away and may not stayed be but as aspeedie post that passes by i hate to speak my voice is spent with crying i hate to hear loud plaints have dulled mine ears i hate to taste for food withholds my dying i hate to see mine eyes are dimmed with tears i hate to smell no sweet on earth is left i hate to feel my flesh is numbed with fears so all my senses from me are bereft i hate all men and shun all womankind the one because as i they wretched are the other for because i do not find my love with them that wont to be their star and life i hate because it will not last and death i hate because it life does mar and all i hate that is to come or passed so all the world and all in it i hate because it changes ever too and from and never stands in one certain state but still unsteadfast round about does go like a mill wheel in midst of misery driven with streams of wretchedness and woe that dying lives and living still does die so do i live so do i daily die and pine away in self-consuming pain sith she that did my vital powers supply and feeble spirits in their force maintain is fetched from me why seek i to prolong my weary days in dolour and disdain weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 6 why do i longer live in life's despite and do not die then in despite of death why do i longer see this loathsome light and do in darkness not abridge my breath sith all my sorrow should have end thereby and cares find quiet is it so uneath to leave this life or dolorous to die to live i find it deadly dolorous for life draws care and care continual woe therefore to die must needs be joyous and wishful thing this fad life to forgo but i must stay i may it not amend my daphne hence departing bade me so she bade me stay till she for me did send yet whilst i in this wretched vale do stay my weary feet shall ever wandering be that still i may be ready on my way when as her messenger does come for me ne will i rest my feet for feebleness ne will i rest my limbs for frailty ne will i rest mine eyes for heaviness but as the mother of the gods that sought for fair eurydice her daughter deer throughout the world with woeful heavy thought so will i travel whilst i tarry here ne will i lodge ne will i ever lin ne when as drooping titan draws near to lose his teem will i take up my inn ne sleep the harbinger of weary wights shall ever lodge upon mine eyelids more ne shall with rest refresh my fainting sprights nor failing force to former strength restore but i will wake and sorrow all the night with philumene my fortune to deplore with philumene the partner of my plighted and ever as i see the star to fallen and under ground to go to give them light which dwell in darkness i to mind will call how my fair star that shined on me so bright fell suddenly and faded under ground since whose departure day is turned to night and night without a venus star is found but soon as day does show his dewy face and calls forth men unto their toilsome trade i will withdraw me to some darksome place or some deer came or solitary shade there will i sighs and sorrow all day long and the huge burden of my cares vn lade weep shepherd weep to make my undersong 7 henceforth mine eyes shall never more behold fair thing on earth ne feed on false delight of ought that framed is of mortal mould sith that my fairest flower is faded quite for all i see is vain and transitory ne will be held in any steadfast plighted but in a moment lose their grace and glory and you found men on fortune's wheel that ride or in ought under heaven repose assurance be it riches beauty or honours pride be sure that they shall have no long endurance but ere you be aware will flit away for nought of them is yours but only usance of a small time which none ascertain may and you true lovers whom disastrous chance hath far exiled from your ladies grace

philosopher concerning the shortness and uncertainty of this life with the contrary ends of the good and wicked translated out of greek by edw. spenser hereto is annexed a sweet speech or oration spoken at the triumph at white-hall before her majesty by the page to the right noble earl of oxenforde cb. semper eadem at london printed for cuthbert burbie and are to be sold at the middle shop in the poultry under s. mildreds church anno. 1592. to the right worshipful master benedic barnam esquire alderman and sheriff of this honourable city of london health and happiness worshipful sir i am bold by way of dedication to give ye this excellent dialogue of plato the philosopher for two reasons the first that so singular a work done by a heathen man might as well flourish in our vulgar speech as of long time it hath done both in greek and latin the seconde that your countenance might shadow it from reproachful slanders which common censures too lightly bolt out against the best endeavours but concerning the special matter to wit my presumption without first acquainting ye herewith thus i protect my self my familiarity with ye in your younger years when sometime we were scholars together and my present joy to see you so happy a succeeder both in your father's virtues place and office emboldened me to show a remembrance of the one yet reverently and gladness of the other as well becomes me if in this small gift you make acceptance both of the one and other ye shall declare no less then each one well discerns in you and joy him that every way is at your command to the reader this dialogue of axiochus gentle reader was translated out of greek by that worthy scholar and poet master edward spenser whose studies have & do carry no mean commendation because their deserts are of so great esteem if herein thou find not the delightful pleasures his verses yields yet shalt thou receive matter of as high contentment to wit comfort in the very latest extremity for his sake then be kind in acceptance hereof and do him the right he very well deserves axiochus of plato or a dialogue of death being both short and very elegant socrates clinias axiochus as i went one day to my common school lynosargus and being in the way by elizeus i might hear the voice of one calling aloud to me socrates and turning me about to see whence it came i saw clinias axiochus his son together with damon the musician & charmides the son of glauco running hastily towards callirrhoe whereof the one was a master and professor of the art of music & the other by means of great familiarity & acquaintance did both love him and also was of him beloved whereupon i thought good leaving my ready way to go meet them that i might the sooner understand his meaning then clinias bursting out in tears oh socrates quod he now is the time when thou mayest show forth thy long fostered and famous wisdom for my father is even now taken with a grievous disease and drawing near as it seems to his end is therewithal grievously troubled and greatly disquieted howbeit heretofore he was so far from the fear of death as that he was wont pleasantly to scoff and scorn at those which used to portrait the image of death painting him with a dreadful countenance and a grisly face wherefore i beseech thee oh socrates to go and comfort my father as you were wont to do for so the rather being strengthened with your good counsel he shall be able without any grudging or fainting to pass through the way of all flesh and i with the rest of his friends and kinsmen will maintain the yearly memory of that his good end socrates o clinias i will not deny thy so reasonable a request specially concerning such a matter as to deny it were great unkindness and discourtesy to grant it pertaineth both to godliness and charity let us therefore speed us to him for if thy father be in so soar taking there needs speediness and great haste clinias o socrates i am sure that my father assoon as he but beholdeth you will be much better at ease for his fit and pangs of his sickness use oftentimes to surcease and be assuaged socrates but that we might the sooner come to him we took the way which lies beside the town wall by the gardens for his dwelling was hard by the gates which lies towards the amazons pillar whither we coming found axiochus which by this time was come to himself again being indeed somewhat strong in his body but very weak and feeble in his mind and resting altogether comfortless often tossing him and tumbling up and down in his bed fetching deep and doleful sighs with abundant streams of trickling tears and wailful wringing of his hands whom beholding oh axiochus quoth i what means this where be now those haughty and courageous words wherewith thou wast wont to scorn and despise death where be those thy daily and continual praises of virtue and goodness vanished where also is now that thy unspeakable stoutness wherewith thou wast wont to confirm thy self and strengthen others for like as a cowardly champion which at the first coming forth as to the skirmish with stately steps and a vaunting visage doth soon after cast away his target and takes him to flight even so seemest thou now when there is need most of all to flinch hast thou no more regard of thy divine and excellent nature that sometime wast a man of so good life and calling so obedient to reasons rule and if there were nothing else yet should it be sufficient to move thee that thou art and athenian born and lastly should move thee that common saying which is worn in all men's mouths that this our life is a pilgrimage which when we have ended with perfect measure and steadfast travel it behooves us with like constancy of mind and ioyfulnes of spirit and as it were singing a merry paean to enter into the purposed place of rest but thus to languish in despair and tender hearted outcries behaving thy self like a froward babe in thee is neither regard of thy wisdom nor respect of thy age axiochus true indeed oh socrates and that which thou sayest me seems right but it comes to pass i know not how that when i draw near unto present danger than those great and stouthearted words which i was wont to cast at death do closely flit away and down are trodden underfoot and then that torment or fear the messenger of dreaded dangers doth sundry ways wound and gall my grieved mind whispering continually in mine ear that if i be once deprived of this worldly light and bereft of goods i shall like a rotten block lie in the darksome depth neither seen nor herd of any being resolved into dust and worms socrates o axiochus thy talk is very foolish for reasoning thus without reason and seeking to make some sense of senseless words thou both dost and sayest clean contrary to thy self not marking how at one time thou dost both complain for the lack of sense which thou shalt have and also art greatly vexed for the rotting of thy carrion carcase and despoiling of thy former delights as if by this death thou shouldst not pass into another life or shouldst be so despoiled of all sense and feeling as thou wertenberg before thou wast first brought into this world for even as in those years when draco and callisthenes governed the common wealth of athens thou then wast vexed with no evil for in the beginning thou wast not such as to whom evil might chance so likewise when thou hast ended this state of mortality thou shalt no more be afflicted for thou shalt not be in such case as that any evil can touch thee wherefore shake off and castaway all these trifles and worldly baggage thus weighing in thy mind that when the frame of this earthly building is dissolved and the soul being singled is restored to his natural place this body which is then left and earthly mass and and unreasonable substance is then no more a man for we are a soul that is to say and immortal creature being shut up and enclosed in and earthly dungeon vvherewithall nature hath clothed us and charged us with many misery's so that even those things which seem pleasant to us and joyful are indeed but vain and shadowed being mingled and wrapped in many thousand sorrows and those also which use to breed us sorrow and heaviness are both sudden and therefore more hardly avoided and also perdurable and therefore the more painful and wearisome such be diseases and inflammation of the senses such be inward griefs and sicknesses through which it cannot choose but that the soul must be also diseased since that being scattered and spread through the powers and passages of the body it covets the use of that open and kind heaven out of which it was derived and thirsteth for the wonted company & surpassing delights of that aerernall fellowship whereby it is evident that the passage from life is a change from much evil to great good axiochus since therefore oh socrates thou deemest this life so tedious and troublesome why dost thou still abide in the same being as thou art a man of so great wisdom and experience whose knowledge reaches far above our common sense and beyond the usual reason of most men socrates thou axiochus dost not report rightly of me for thou judgest as the common people of athens that because you see i am given to seek and search out many things therefore i know somewhat but to say the truth i would heartily wish and would the same account in great part of happiness if i knew but these common and customable matters so far am i from the knowledge of those high and excellent things for these things which i now declare are the sayings of prodicus the wise man some of them being bought for a penny some for two groats and other some for foure for that same notable man used to teach none without wages having always in his mouth that saying of epicharmus one hand rubbeth another give somewhat and somewhat take and it is not long since that he making a discourse of philosophy in the house of callias the son of hipponicus such and so many things he spoke against the state of life that i also account life in the number of those things which be of less weight and ever since that time oh axiochus my soul gaspeth after death daily longing to die axiochus what then was said of prodicus socrates marry i will tell you as they come to my mind for what parcel quod he of our life is not full of wretchedness doth not the baby even taken from the mother's womb pour out plenty of tears beginning the first step of life with grief neither afterwards hath it once any breathing or resting time from sorrow being either distressed with poverty or pinched with cold or scorched with heat or pained with stripes and whatsoever it suffers utter once it cannot but only with crying doth show his mind having no voice but that alone to bewray his grief and having through many woes waded to seauen years of age he is yet afflicted with greater griefs being subject to the tyranny of the schoolmaster and tutor and as his years increased so is the number of his guides and governors increased being afterwards in the hands of censors philosophers and captains soon after being waxed a stripling he is hemmed in with greater fear namely of lyceum of the academy of the school of games of rulers of rods and to shut up all in one word of infinite misery's and all the time of his youth is spent under overseers which are set over him by the areopagits from which labours young men being once freed are yet overlaid with greater cares and more weighty thoughts touching the ordering of his state and trade of life which also if they be compared with those that follow all these former troubles may seem but childish and indeed babish trifles for hereupon doth a troop of evils accrue as be the exploits of warfare the bitterness of wounds the continual labour skirmishes and then closely creeps on old age in which are heaped all the harms that pertain to mankind whither of weakness as natural or of pain as being external and but if one betimes restore his life as a due debt to death nature ever waiting as a greedy usurer takes pains aforehand snatching and pulling from this man his sighed from that his hearing from some both two senses and if any fortune longer then commonly is seen in this life to linger nature weakening his powers doth lose lame and bow down all parts of his body but they whose bodies in old age long flourishes in mind as the saying is become twice children and therefore the gods knowing what is most expedient for men those whom they most dearly love do soonest take out of this vale of wretchedness and for this cause agamedes and trophonius when they had built a temple to pythius apollo desiring of the god therefore to grant them the best reward that might be given soon after when they laid them down to rest never rose again likewise cleobis & biton the sons of the argive nun when their mother had made his prayer to iuno that to her sons for their great godliness might be given some singular gift for that they when her yoke of oxen were not readily to be found at the time of sacrifice themselves being yoked in the chariot drew their mother to the temple upon this their mother's request the two sons the next morning were found dead it were too long in this place to rehearse the testimonies of poets which in their divine poesies do divinely bewail and lament the misery's of men life i will now only in place of many recite the witness of one being most worthy of memory which thus says how wretched a thread of life have the gods spun to mortal men that in this raze of life do run ▪ and again of all that in the earth are ordained by nature than man is not to be found a more wretched creature but of amphiaraus what says the poet him loved highest iupiter and apollo deer yet could he not reach to his eldest year what thinkest thou of him that taught the child to cry when first the sun bright day he sees with tender eye but i will let them pass least contrary to promise i seem to discourse at large and that in the alleging of foreign witnesses what trade of life i pray you is there or what occupation of which you shall not find many that complain and greatly mislike of their present affairs let us overrun the companies of artificers & craftsmen which continually labour from night to night and yet hardly able to find them necessaries to live by bewailing their bore estate & filling their nightwatchings with sorrow and tears let us else suruew the life of mariners and seafaring men which make a hold through so many dangers & which as bias said are neither in the number of the living nor yet of the dead for man being born to abide upon the earth doth as it were a creature of a double kind thrust himself into the main sea and wholly put his life into the hands of fortune but the life of husbandmen will some say is pleasant and so in deed it is but have they not a continual rankling gall ever breeding new cause of grief and disquiet sometime by reason of drought sometime because of rain otherwhile for scorching oft through blasting which parcheth the untimely ear oftentimes because of importunate heat or unmeasurable cold miserably weeping and complaining but above all that honourable state of government and principality for i let pass many other things & wrap them up in silence through how many dangers is it tossed and turmoiled for if at any time it have any cause of joy it is like unto a blown blister or a swelling soar soon up and sooner down oftentime suffering a foul repulse which seems a thousand times worse then death it self for who at any time can be blessed that hangs upon the wavering will of the witless many and albeit the magistrate deserve favour and praise yet is he but a mocking stock and scoff of the commonalty being soon after outcast hissed at condemned and delivered to a miserable death for where i pray thee oh axiochus thee i ask that art in office in the commonwealth died that mighty miltiades where that victorious themistocles where that valiant ephialtes where finally thse noble kings and glorious emperors which not long a go flourished in the common wealth as for my self i could never be brought to bear office in the city for i never accounted it as a worthy and laudable thing to be in authority together with the madding multitude but theramenes and calixenus of late memory appointing under them certain magistrates condemned certain guiltless men not hearing their causes to undeserved death only withstood them you and triptolemus of thirty thousand men which were gathered in the assembly axiochus it is as thou sayest socrates and since that time i have refrained my self from the stage neither hath any thing ever to me seemed of greater waighte then the governing of the commonwealth and that is well known to them which are in the same office for thou speakest these things as having out of some high loft only overlooked the troubles and tempests of the commonwealth but we know the same more assuredly having made proof therefore in ourselves for the common people indeed our friends socrates is unthankful disdainful cruel envious and unlearned as that is gathered together of the scum and dregs of the rascal rout and a sort of idle lozels whom he that flattereth and feeds is much worse himself than they socrates since therefore oh axiochus thou dost so greatly disallow that opinion which of all other is counted most honest and liberal what shall we judge of the other trades of life shall we not think that they are likewise to be shunned i remember that i once herd prodicus say that death pertaineth neither to the living nor to the dead axiochus how mean you that socrates socrates mary thus that death touches not them that are and as for those that are departed out of this life are now no more and therefore death now touches them not for thou art not yet dead neither if thou decease shall it concern thee for thou shalt then have no more therefore most vain is that sorrow which axiochus makes for the thing which neither is present nor shall ever touch axiochus himself and even as foolish is it as if one should complain and be afraid of scylla or the centaur's which were monsters of poets brood which neither now belong to thee nor to thy lives end shall appertain for fear is conceived of such things as be but of such things as be not what fear can there be axiochus truly socrates you have fetched these things out of the rich and most abundant storehouse of your wondered wisdom and thereof riseth that your mildness and lightness of speech which you use to allure the minds of young men to virtue but the loss of these worldly commodities doth not a little vex and disquiet my mind albeit these reasons which now to my great good liking you have alleged seem to me much more allowable than those which late you used for my mind is not carried away with error through the enticement of your words but perceives them well neither do those things greatly move my mind which only have a colour and shadowed show of truth being set out with flaunting pride and glory of words but yet truth have they none socrates thou art far wide axiochus and reasonest unskilfully joining the feeling of evil with the want of good things forgetting thy self that then thou shalt be in the number of the senseless dead for him indeed which is bereft of all good things doth the contrary force of evil things greatly vex but he which hath no being can take nor feel nothing in place of those things whereof he is despoiled then by what reason can any grief be conceived of that thing which breeds no sense nor perseverance of any thing which hurteth for if in the beginning o axiochus thou didst not though indeed in vain join sense and feeling to death most unwisely thou shouldst never had cause to fear death but now thou dost confound thy self and speakest contrary to thy self oft fearing that thou shalt be deprived of soul and sense together and oft thinking that with thy sense thou shalt feel that thing whereof there is no sense nor feeling and to this purpose do all those excellent and notable reasons of the souls immortality tend for it is not the weak nature of mortal man to raise himself to the fulfilling of such high and haughty matters as to despise the ramping rage of wild beasts to jeopard himself in the wasteful sea to build cities and them with laws and policy to establish to look up into heaven and mark the course of the stars and the ways of the sun and moon with their risings and setting to consider their eclipses their spaces their making of the nights and days alike their double conversions to behold the order of the winds the seauen watery stars of winter of summer of storms with the violent rage of whirlwinds and as it were these labours of the world to deliver to posterity unless in our minds there were a certain divine spirit and understanding which could comprehend and reach unto the supernatural knowledge of so great matters wherefore now oh axiochus thou art not in the way to death but to immortality neither shalt thou as thou didst seem right now to fear be bereft of all good but shall hereby enjoy true and perfect good neither shalt thou perceive such dirty pleasures as are these being mingled with the puddle of this sinful body but most pure and perfect delight being devoid of all contagious trouble for being loosed and delivered out of the darksome dungeons of this body thou shalt pass to that place where is no lack nor complaint but all things full of rest and devoid of evil moreover there is calm and quiet living without all knowledge of unrest peaceable and still occupied in beholding the course & frame of nature and studying philosophy not to please the idle ignorant and common sort but with upright and undeceivable truth axiochus o socrates with this thy gladsome speech thou hast now brought me into a clean contrary mind for so far am i now from dread of death that i am even set on fire and burn with desire thereof and that i may stay my self in the steps of them which are counted workmasters of speech i will say thus much more excellently now i begin to behold those high matters and do overlook that eternal and heavenly course of things having now raised up my self out of my weakness and being as it were renewed and refreshed of my former malady socrates if you demand of me another reason and sign of the souls immortality i will tell you what the wise man gobrias showed me he said that at what time xerxes conveyed his huge army into greece his grandfather which was of the same name was sent into delos to defend that island in which were two gods born in the same island that his grandfather learned out of certain brazen tables which opis and hecuergus had brought out of the northern countries that the soul aftertime it is dissolved from the body passes into a certain darksome place a coast that lies under the earth wherein is plutoes palace no less than iupiters kingdom for the earth being equally balanced in the midst of the world and the compass thereof being round as a ball that the one half sphere thereof is allotted to the higher gods and the other half to the infernal powers betwixt whom there is such kindred and alliance that some be brother's and other some brother's children but the entry of the way which leads to plutoes kingdom is fenced with iron gates and fastened with brazen bolts which when a man hath opened he is entertained of the river acheron next which is cocytus which floods being overpassed he must come before minos and rhadamanthus the merciless judges which place is called the plain of truth where the judges fit examining every one that comes thither how he hath lived and with what trade or manner of life he hath inhabited his mortal body with whom there is no place for lies nor refuge for excuses then they which in their life time were inspired and led with a good angel are received into the household of the blessed where all seasons flow with abundance of all fruits where from the silver springs do calmly run the crystal streams where the flourishing meadows are clothed with changeable mantles of glorious colours where are famous schools of renowned philosophers goodly companies of divine poets trim sorts of dancers heavenly music great banquets furnished with costly cates tables abounding with all bounty delights without all care and pleasures without all pain for the inhabitants thereof are neither touched with force of cold nor pained with excess of heat but the moderate air breathes on them mildly and calmly being lightened with the gentle sunnebeames in this place and in the elysian fields they which have taken holy order are highly advanced and reverenced daily ministering the unsearchable rites of religion wherefore then shouldst thou doubt but to be made partaker of the same honour being one of the seed of that heavenly raze it is and old saying and rightly reported that hercules and bacchus going down to hell they were instituted in holly order and that they were emboldened to go thither of the goddess eleusina but they which being wrapped in wickedness have led and ungodly life are snatched up by the furies and by them carried through the lowest hell into deep darkness and utter confusion where the place and abided of the wicked is and where the three score daughters of danaus dwell whose punishment is continually to fill a sort of bottomless vessels where also is to be seen the unquenchable thirst of tantalus the gnawen entrails of titius and the endless stone of sisipus whose end begins a new labour there be they rend of wild beasts continually scorched with burning lamps pained with all kind of torments and afflicted with endless penance these things i remember that i have herd gobrias tell but you axiochus may judge of them as you list only this i know and assuredly hold fast that every men mind is immortal and passing out of this life feeleth no grief nor sorrow wherefore oh axiochus whither thou be carried into those highest palaces or lower vawts needs must it be that thou shalt be blessed because thou hast lived well and godly axiochus minding to have said something unto thee oh socrates i am impeached with bashful shame for so far am i now from the horror and dread of death that i continually covet the time thereof so hath thy heavenly and comfortable speeches pierced and relieved my faint heart and now loath i this life and scorn the delights thereof as that shall from henceforth pass into a better abided and now by my self alone will i recount these thy notable sayings but i pray thee oh socrates after noon resort to me again socrates i will do as you say and now will i return to walk in my school lynosargus from whence i was hither called finis ❧ a speech spoken at the triumph before the queens most excellent majesty by the page to the right noble champion the earl of oxenford by the tilt stood a stately tent of orenge tawny taffeta curiously embroidered with silver & pendents on the pinnacles very sightly to behold from forth this tent came the noble earl of oxenford in rich gilded armour and sat down under a great high bay-tree the whole stock branches and leaves whereof were all gilded over that nothing but gold could be discerned by the tree stood twelue tilting staves all which likewise were gilded clean over after a solemn found of most sweet music he mounted on his courser very richly caparasond when his page ascending the stairs where her highness stood in the window delivered to her by speech this oration following this knight most fair and fortunate princess living of a long time in a grove where every grafted being green he thought every root to be precious found at the last as great diversity of troubles as of trees the oak to be so stubborn that nothing could cause it to bend the reed so shaking that every blast made it to bow the juniper sweet but too low for succour the cypress fair but without fruit the walnut tree to be as unwholesome to lie under as the bud of the figtree unpleasant to taste the tree that boar the best fruit to be fullest of caterpillars and all to be infected with worms the ash for ravens to breed the elm to built the elder to be full of pith & no perfection and all trees that were not fertile to be fit for fuel and they that were fruitful but for the time to please the fancy which trying he forsook the wood and lived a while in the plain champion where how he was tormented it were too long to tell but let this suffice that he was troubled when every moat fell in his eye in the day and every ant disquieted him in the night where if the wind blew he had nothing to shield him but head and shoulders if the sun blazed he could find the shadow of nothing but himself when seeing himself so destitute of help he becam desperate of hope thus wandering a weary way he espied at the last a tree so beautiful that his eyes were dazzled with the brightness which as he was going unto he met by good fortune a pilgrim or hermit he knew not well who being appareled as though he were to travail into all countries but so aged as though he were to live continually in a cave of this old sire he demanded what tree it was who taking this knight by the hand began in these words both to utter the name and nature of the tree this tree fair knight is called the tree of the sun whose nature is always to stand alone not suffering a companion being it self without comparison of which kind there are no more in the earth then suns in the element the world can hold but one phoenix one alexander one sun-tree in top contrary to all trees it is strongest & so stately to behold that the more other shrubs shrink for duty the higher it exalteth it self in majesty for as the clear beams of the sun cause all the stars to loose their light so the brightness of this golden tree eclipseth the commendation of all other plants the leaves of pure gold the bark no worse the buds pearls the body chrisocolla the sap nectar the root so noble as it springs from two turkeies both so perfect as neither can stain the other each contending once for superiority and now both constrained to be equals vestas bird sitteth in the midst whereat cupid is ever drawing but dares not shoot being amazed at that princely and perfect majesty the shadows hath as strange properties as contrarieties cooling those that be hot with a temperate calm and heating those that be cold with a moderate warmth not unlike that sun whereof it takes the name which melts wax and hardeneth clay or pure fire which causeth the gold to shine and the straw to smother or sweet perfumes which feeds the bee and killeth the betell no poison comes near it nor any vermin that hath a sting who so goes about to lop it lanceth himself and the sun will not shine on that creature that casts a false eye on that tree no wind can so much as wag a leaf it springs in spite of autumnus and continueth all the year as it were ʋer if sir knight you demand what fruit it bears i answer such as the elder it is the younger it seems always ripe yet ever green virtue sir knight more nourishing to honest thoughts then the beauty delightful to amorous eyes where the graces are as thick in virtue as the grapes are on the vine this fruit fatteth but never feeds wherewith this tree is so loaded as you cannot touch that place which virtue hath not tempered if you inquire whither any grafts may be got it were as much as to crave slyppes of the sun or a mould to cast a new moon to conclude such a tree it is as he that hath longest known it can sooner marvel at it then describe it for the further he wadeth in the praise the shorter he comes of the perfection this old man having ended seeming to want words to express such worthiness he went to his home and the knight to his sun tree where kissing the ground with humility the princely tree seemed with to bid him welcome but the more z on the beauty the less able he w dure the brightness like unto those king with a steadfast eye to behold that bring a dark dazzling over their sighed at the last resting under the shadow he felt such content as nothing could be more comfortable the days he spent in virtuous delights the night slipped away in golden dreams he was never annoyed with venomous enemies nor disquieted with idle cogitations in so much that finding all felicity in that shade and all security in that sun he made a solemn vow to incorporate his heart into that tree and ingraft his thoughts upon those virtues swearing that as there is but one sun to shine over it one root to give life unto it one top to maintain majesty so there should be but one knight either to live or die for the defence thereof whereupon he swore himself only to be the knight of the tree of the sun whose life should end before his loyalty thus cloyed with content he fell into a sweet slumber whose smiling countenance showed him void of all care but his eyes were scarce close d when he seemed to see dy ermining the tree behind him that suspecting the knight to gyve thee might have punished him in her failing of their pretence and seeing we they struck to light upon their wne brains they threatened him by violence whom they could not match in virtue but he clasping the tree as the only anchor of his trust they could not so much as move him from his cause whom they determined to martyr without colour whereupon they made a challenge to win the tree by right and to make it good by arms at which saying the knight being glad to have his truth tried with his valour for joy awaked and now most virtuous and excellent princess seeing such tumults towards for his tree such and honourable presence to judge such worthy knights to just i cannot tell whither his perplexity or his pleasure be the greater but this he will avouch at all assays himself to be the most loyal knight of the sun-tree which who so gainsayeth he is here pressed either to make him recant it before he run or repent it after offering rather to die upon the points of a thousande lances then to yield a jot in constant loyalty finis the speech being ended with great honour he ran and valiantly brake all the twelue staves and after the finishing of the sports both the rich bay-tree and the beautiful

attain too i mean likewise for your favour sake to set forth in the mean time praying you gently to accept of these & graciously to entertain the new poet i take leave dedicated to the right noble and beautiful lady the la. marry countess of pembrooke most honourable and bountiful lady there be long since deep sowed in my breast to seed of most entire love & humble affection unto that most brave knight your noble brother deceased which taking root began in is life time somewhat to bud forth and to show themselves to him as then in the weakness of their first spring and would in their riper strength had it pleased high god till then to draw out his days spired forth fruit of more perfection but since god hath disdained the world of that most noble spirit which was the hope of all learned men and the patron of my young muses together with him both their hope of any further fruit was cut off and also the tender delight of those their first blossoms nipped and quite dead yet since my late coming into england some friends of mine which might much prevail with me and indeed command me knowing with how straight bands of duty i was tied to im as also bound unto that noble house of which the chief hope then rested in him have sought to revive them by upbraiding me for that i have not showed any thankful remembrance towards him or any of them but suffer their names to sleep in silence and forgetfulness whom chiefly to satisfy or else to avoid that owl blot of unthankfulness i have conceived this small poem entitled by a general name of the world's ruins yet specially intended to the renowming of that noble raze from which both you and he sprung and to the eternizing of some of the chief of them late deceased the which i dedicate unto your la. as whom it most specially concerns and to whom i acknowledge my self bounden by many singular favours & great graces i pray for your honourable happiness & so humbly kiss your haudes your ladyships ever humbly at command e. s. the ruins of time it chanced me on day beside the shore of silver streaming thamesis to be nigh where the goodly verlame stood of yore of which there now remains no memory nor any little monument to see by which the traveler that fares that way this once was she may warned be to say there on the other side i did behold a woman sitting sorrowfully wailing rending her yellow locks like wyrie gold about her shoulders carelessly down trailing and streams of tears from her fair eyes forth railing in her right hand a broken rod she held which towards heaven she seemed on high to wielded whither she were one of that rivers nymphs which did the loss of some dear love lament i doubt or one of those three fatal imps which draw the days of men forth in extent or ancient genius of that city brent but seeing her so piteously perplexed i to her calling asked what her so vexed ah what delight quoth she in earthly thing or comfort can i wretched creature have whose happiness the heavens envying from highest stair to lowest step me drove and have in mine own bowels made my graven that of all nations now i am forlorn the world's sad spectacle and fortune's scorn much was i moved at her piteous plaint and felt my heart nigh riven in my breast with tender ruth to see her soar constraint that shedding tears a while i still did rest and after did her name of her request name have i none quoth she nor any being bereft of both by fates unjust decreeing i was that city which the garland wore of britaines pride delivered unto me by roman victor's which it won of yore though nought at all but ruins now i be and lie in mine own ashes as you see verlame i was what boots it that i was sith now i am but weeds and wasteful grass o vain world's glory and unsteadfast state of all that lives on face of sinful earth which from their first until their utmost date taste no one hour of happiness or mirth but like as at the ingate of their berth they crying creep out of their mother's womb so wailing back go to their woeful tomb why then doth flesh a bubble glass of breath hunt after honour and advancement vain and rear a trophy for devouring death with so great labour and long lasting pain as if his days for ever should remain sith all that in this world is great or gay does as a vapour vanish and decay look back who list unto the former ages and call to count what is of them become where be those learned wits and antique sages which of all wisdom knew the perfect somme where those great warriors which did overcome the world with conquest of their might and main and made one mere of earth & of their rain what now is of th'assyrian lioness of whom no footing now on earth appears what of the persian bears outrageousness whose memory is quite worn out with years who of the grecian libbard now ought hears that overran the east with greedy pour and left his whelps their kingdoms to devour and where is that same great seuen headed beast that made all nations vassals of her pride to fallen before her feet at her behest and in the neck of all the world did ride where does she all that wondrous wealth now hide with her own weight down pressed now she lies and by her heaps her hugeness testifies o room thy ruin i lament and rue and in thy fallen my fatal overthrown that whilom was while heavens with equal view deigned to behold me and their gifts bestow the picture of thy pride in pompous show and of the whole world as thou wast the empress so i of this small northern world was princess to tell the beauty of my buildings fair adorned with purest gold and precious stone to tell my riches and endowments rare that by my foes are now all spent and gone to tell my forces matchable to none were but lost labour that few would believe and with rehearsing would me more agreeue high towers fair temples goodly theaters strong walls rich porches princely palaces large streets brave houses sacred sepulchers sure gates sweet gardens stately galleries wrought with fair pillars and fine imageries all those o pity now are turned to dust and overgrown with black oblivions rust thereto for warlike power and peoples store in britannie was none to match with me that many often did aby full soar ne troynouant though elder sister she with my great forces might compared be that stout pendragon to his peril felt who in a siege seauen years about me dwelled but long ere this bunduca britonnesse her mighty host against my bulwarks brought bunduca that victorious conqueress that lifting up her brave heroïck thought above women's weakness with the romans fought fought and in field against them thrice prevailed yet was she foiled when as she me assailed and though at last by force i conquered were of hardy saxons and became their thrall yet was i with much bloodshed bought full deer and prizde with slaughter of their general the monument of whose sad funeral for wonder of the world long in me lasted but now to nought through spoil of time is wasted wasted it is as if it never were and all the rest that me so honoured made and of the world admired every where is turned to smoke that does to nothing fade and of that brightness now appears no shade but greislie shades such as do haunt in hell with fearful fiends that in deep darkness dwell where my high steeples whilom used to stand on which the lordly falcon wont to tower there now is but and heap of lime and sand for the shriche-owle to built her baleful bower and where the nightingale wont forth to pour her restless plaints to comfort wakeful lovers there now haunt yelling mews & whining plovers and where the crystal thamis wont to slide in silver channel down along the lee about whose flowery banks on either side a thousand nymphs with mirthful jollity were wot to play from all annoyance free there now no rivers course is to be seen but moorish fens and marshes ever green seems that that gentle river for great grief of my mishaps which oft i to him played or for to shun the horrible mischiee with which he saw my cruel oes me pained and his pure streams with guiltless blood oft stained from my unhappy neighbourhood far fled and his sweet waters away with him led there also where the winged ships were seen in liquid waves to cut their fomie way and thousand fishers numbered to have been in that wide lake looking for plenteous pray of fish which they with baits used to betray is now no lake nor any fishers store nor ever ship shall sail there any more they all are gone and all with them is gone ne ought to me remains but to lament my long decay which no man else does moan and mourn my fallen with doleful dreariment yet it is comfort in great languishment to be bemoaned with compassion kind and mitigates the anguish of the mind but me no man bewaileth but in game ne sheds tears from lamentable eye nor any lives that mentioneth my name to be remembered of posterity save one that maugre fortune's injury and times decay and envies cruel tort hath writ my record in true-seeming sort cambden the nourice of antiquity and lantern unto late succeeding age to see the light of simple verity buried in ruins through the great outrage of her own people led with warlike rage cambden though time all monuments obscure yet thy just labours ever shall endure but why unhappy wight do i thus cry and grieve that my remembrance quite is razed out of the knowledge of posterity and all my antique monuments defaced sith i do daily see things highest placed so soon as fates their vital thread have shorn forgotten quite as they were never born it is not long since these two eyes beheld a mighty prince of most renowned raze whom england high in count of honour held and greatest ones did sue to gain his grace of greatest ones he greatest in his place sat in the bosom of his sovereign and right and loyal did his word maintain i saw him die i saw him die as one of the mean people and brought forth on bear i saw him die and no man left to moan his doleful fate that late him loved deer scarce any left to close his eyelids near scarce any left upon his lips to lay the sacred sod or requiem to say o trustless state of miserable men that build your bliss on hope of earthly thing and vainly think your selves half happy then when painted faces with smooth flattering doo fawn on you and your wide praises sing and when the courting masker louteth low him true in heart and trusty to you trow all is but feigned and with oaker died that every shower will wash and wipe away all things do change that under heaven abide ad after death all friendship does decay therefore what ever man bearest worldly sway living on god and on thy self rely for when thou diest all shall with thee die h now is dead and all is with him dead save what in heavens store house he vplaid his hope is failed and come to pass his dread and evil men now dead his deeds upbraid spite bites the dead that living never baid he now is gone the while the fox is crept into the hold the which the badger swept he now is dead and all his glory gone and all his greatness vapoured to nought that as a glass upon the water shone which vanished quite so soon as it was sought his name is worn already out of thought ne any poet seeks him to revive yet many poets honoured him alive ne does his colin careless colin clout care now his idle bagpipe up to raise ne tell his sorrow to the listening rout of shepherd grooms which wont his songs to praise praise who so list yet i will him dispraise until he quite him of this guilty blame wake shepherds boy at length awake for shame and who so else did goodness by him gain and who so else his bounteous mind did try whither he shepherd be or shepherds swain for many did which do it now deny awake and to his song a part apply and i the whilst you mourn for his decease will with my mourning plaints your plaint increase he died and after him his brother died his brother prince his brother noble peer that whilst he lived was of none envied and dead is now as living counted deer dear unto all that true affection bear but unto thee most deer o dearest dame his noble spouse and paragon of fame he whilst he lived happy was through thee and being dead is happy now much more living that linked chanced with thee to be and dead because him dead thou dost adore as living and thy lost deer love deplore so while that thou fair flower of chastity dost live by thee thy lord shall never die thy lord shall never die the while this verse shall live and surely it shall live for ever for ever it shall live and shall rehearse his worthy praise and virtues dying never though death his soul do from his body sever and thou thy self herein shalt also live such grace the heavens do to my verses give ne shall his sister ne thy father die thy father that good earl of rare renown and noble patron of weak poverty whose great good deeds in country and in town have purchased him in heaven and happy crown where he now lives in etenll bliss and left his son ' ensue those steps of his he noble bud his grandsires lively hair under the shadow of thy countenance now begins to shoot up fast and flourish fair in learned arts and goodly governance that him to highest honour shall advance brave imp of bedford grow apace in bounty and count of wisdom more than of thy county ne may i let thy husbands sister die that goodly lady sith she eke did spring out of this stock and famous family whose praises i to future age do sing and forth out of her happy womb did bring the sacred brood of learning and all honour in whom the heavens powrde all their gifts upon her most gentle spirit breathed from above out of the bosom of the makers bliss in whom all bounty and all virtuous love appeared in their native properties and did enrich that noble breast of his with treasure passing all this world's worth worthy of heaven it self which brought it forth his blessed spirit full of power divine and influence of all celestial grace loathing this sinful earth and earthly slime fled back too soon unto his native place too soon for all that did his love embrace too soon for all this wretched world whom he robbed of all right and true nobility yet ere his happy soul to heaven wnt out of this fleshly goal he did devise unto his heavenly maker to present his body as a spotless sacrifice and chosen that guilty hands of enemies should pour forth offering of his guiltless blood so life exchanging for his countries good o noble spirit live there ever blessed the world's late wonder and the heavens new joy live ever there and leave me here distressed with mortal cares and cumbrous world's annoy but where thou dost that happiness enjoy bid me o bid me quickly come to thee that happy there i may thee always see yet whilst the fates afford me vital breath i will it spend in speaking of thy praise and sing to thee until that timely death by heavens doom do end my earthly days thereto do thou my humble spirit raise and into me that sacred breath inspire which thou there breathest perfect and entire then will i sing but who can better sing than thine own sister peerless lady bright which to thee sings with deep hearts sorrowing sorrowing tempered with deer delight that her to hear i feel my feeble spright robbed of sense and ravished with joy oh sad joy made of mourning and annoy yet will i sing but who can better sing than thou thy self thine own selves valiance that whilst thou livedst madest the forests ring and fields resound and flocks to leap and dance and shepherds leave their lambs unto mischance to run thy shrill arcadian pipe to hear oh happy were those days thrice happy were but now more happy thou and wetched we which want the wonted sweetness of thy voice while thou now in elisian fields so free with orpheus and with linus and the choice of all that ever did in rhymes rejoice conuerest and dost hear their heavenly lays and they hear thine and thine do better praise so there thou livest singing evermore and here thou livest being ever song of us which living loved thee afore and now thee worship amongst that blessed throng of heavenly poets and heroes strong so thou both here and there immortal art and every where through excellent desert but such as neither of themselves can sing nor yet are sung of others for reward die in obscure oblivion as the thing which never was ne ever with regard their names shall of the later age b herd but shall in rusty darkness ever lie unless they mentioned be with infamy what boots it to have been rich alive what to be great what to be gracious when after death no token does survive of former being in this mortal house but sleeps in dust dead and inglorious like beast whose breath but in his nostrils is and hath no hope of happiness or bliss how many great ones may remembered be which in their days most famously did flourish of whom no word we hear nor sign now see but as things wiped out with a sponge to perish because they living cared not to cherish no gentle wits through pride or couertize which might their names for ever memorise provide therefore you princes while you live that of the muses you may friended be which unto men eternity do give for they be daughters of dame memory and ioue the father of eternity and do those men in golden thrones repose whose merits they to glorify do chosen the seuen fold iron gates of grisly hell and horrid house of sad proserpina they able are with power of mighty spell to break and thence the souls to bring away out of dread darkness to eternal day and them immortal make which else would die in soul forgetfulness and nameless lie so whilom raised they the puissant brood of golden grt almena for great merit out of the dust to which the oetaean wood had him consumed and spent his vital spirit to highest heaven where now he does inherit all happiness in hebes silver bower chosen to be her dearest paramour so raised they eke fair ledaes warlike twins and interchanged life unto them lent that when th'one die th'other then begins to show in heaven his brightness orient and they for pity of the sad waiment which orpheus for eurydice did make her back again to life sent for his sake so happy are they and so fortunate whom the pierian sacred sisters love that freed from bans of impacable fate and power of death they live for aye above where mortal wreaks their bliss may not remove but with the gods for former virtues meed on nectar and ambrosia do feed for deeds do die how ever nobly done and thoughts of men do as themselves decay but wise words taught in numbers for to run recorded by the muses live for ay ne may with storming showers be washed away ne bitter breathing winds with harmful blast nor age nor envy shall them ever wast in vain do earthly princes then in vain seek with pyramides to heaven aspired or huge colosses built with costly pain or brazen pillars never to be fired or shrines made of the mettle most desired to make their memories for ever live for how can mortal immortality give such one mansolus made the world's great wonder but now no remnant does thereof remain such one marcellus but was torn with thunder such one lisippus but is worn with rain such one king edmond but was rend for gain all such vain monuments of earthly mass devoured of time in time to nought do pass but fame with golden wings aloft does fly above the reach of ruinous decay and with brave plumes does beat the azure sky admired of baseborn men from far away then who so will with virtuous deeds assay to mount to heaven on pegasus must ride and with sweet poets verse be glorified for not to have been dipped in lethe lake could save the son of thetis from to die but that blind barred did him immortal make with verses dipped in dew of castalie which made the eastern conqueror to cry oh fortunate youngman whose virtue found so brave a trump thy noble acts to found therefore in this half happy i do read good melibae that hath a poet god to sing his living praises being dead deserving never here to be forgotten in spite of envy that his deeds would spot since whose decease learning lies unregarded and men of arms do wander unrewarded those two be those two great calamities that long ago did grieve the noble spright of salomon with great indignities who whilom was alive the wisest wight but now his wisdom is disproved quite for he that now wields all things at his will scorns th'one and th'other in his deeper skill o grief of griefs o gall of all good hearts to see that virtue should despised be of him that first was raised for virtuous parts and now broad spreading like and aged tree lets none shoot up that nigh him planted be oh let the man of whom the muse is scorned nor alive nor dead be of the muse adorned o vile world's trust that with such vain illusion hath so wise men bewitched and overcast that they see not the way of their confusion oh vainesse to be added to the rest that do my soul with inward grief infest let them behold the piteous fallen of me and in my case their own ensample see and who so else that sits in highest seat of this world's glory worshipped of all ne fears change of time nor fortune's threat let him behold the horror of my fallen and his own end unto remembrance call that of like ruin he may warned be and in himself be moved to pity me thus having ended all her piteous plaint with doleful shrieks she vanished away that i through inward sorrow wexen fain and all astonished with deep dismay for her departure had no word to say but sat long time in senseless sad affright looking still if i might of her have sighed which when i missed having looked long my thought returned grieved home again renewing hr complaint with passion strong for ruth of that same woman's pieous pain whose words recording in my troubled brain i felt such anguish wound my feeble heart that frozen horror rn through every part so inly grieving in my groaning breast and deeply musing at her doubtful speech whose meaning much i laboured forth to wrest being above my slender reasons reach at length by demonstration me to teach before mine eyes strange sights presented were like tragic pageants seeming to appear 1 i saw and image all of massy gold placed on high upon and altar fair that all which did the same from far behold might worship it and fallen on lowest stair no that great idol might with this compare to which th'assyrian tyrant would have made the holy brothers falsely to have prayed but th'altare on the which this image stayed was o great pity built of brickle clay that shortly the oundation decayed with showers of heaven and tempests worn away then down it fell and low in ashes lay scorned of every one which by it went that i it sing dearly did lament 2 next unto this a stately tower appeared built all of richest stone that might be found and nigh unto the heavens in height upreared but placed on a plot of sandy ground not that great tower which is so much renowned for tongues confusion in holy writ king ninus work might be compared to it but o vain labours of terrestrial wit that builds so strongly on o frail a soil as with each storm does fallen away and flit and gives the fruit of all your travails toil to be the prey of time and fortune's spoil i saw this tower fallen suddenly to dust that nigh with grief thereof my heart was burst 3 then did i see a pleasant paradise full of sweet flowers and daintiest delights such as on earth man could not more devise with pleasures choice to feed his cheerful sprights not that which merlin by his magic slights made for the gentle squire to entertain his fair belphoebe could this gardine stain but o short pleasure bought with lasting pain why will hereafter any flesh delight in earthly bliss and joy in pleasures vain since that i saw this gardine wasted quite that where it was scarce seemed any sighed that i which once that beauty did behold could not from tears my melting eyes withhold 4 soon after this a giant came in place of wondrous power and of exceeding stature that none durst view the horror of his face yet was he mild of speech and meek of nature not he which in despite of his creator with railing terms defied the jewish host might with this mighty one in hugeness boast for from the one he could to th'other coast stretch his strong thighs and th'occaean ouerstride and reach his hand into his enemies host but see the end of pomp and fleshly pride one of his feet unwares from him did slide that down he fell into the deep abyss where drowned with him is all his earthly bliss 5 then did i see a bridge made all of gold over the sea from one to other side withouten prop or pillar it uphold but like the colored rainbow arched wide not that great arch with traian edifide to be a wonder to all age ensuing was matchable to this in equal viewing but ah what boots i to see earthly thing in glory or in greatness to excel sith time does greatest things to ruin bring this goodly bridge one foot not fastened well gan fail and all the rest down shortly fell ne of so brave a building ought remained that grief thereof my spirit greatly pained 6 i saw two bears as white as any milk lying together in a mighty cave of mild aspect and hair as soft as silk that salvage nature seemed not to have nor after greedy spoil of blood to crave two fairer beasts might not elsewhere be found although the compassed world were sought around but what can long abide above this ground in state of bliss or steadfast happiness the cave in which these bears lay sleeping found was but earth and with her own weightiness upon them fell and did unwares oppress that for great sorrow of their sudden fate henceforth all words felicity i hate ¶ much was i troubled in my heavy spright at sighed of these sad spectacles forepast that all my senses were bereaved quite and i in mind remained soar aghast distracted betwixt fear and pity when at last i herd a voice which loudly to me called that with the sudden shrill i was appalled behold said it and by ensample see that all is vanity and grief of mind ne other comfort in this world can be but hope of heaven and heart to god inclined for all the rest must needs be left behind with that it bade me to the other side to cast mine eye where other sights i spied 1 ¶ upon that famous rivers further shore there stood a snowy swan of heavenly hiew and gentle kind as ever foul afore a fairer one in all the goodly criew of white strimonian brood might no man view there he most sweetly sung the prophecy of his own death in doleful elegy at last when all his mourning melody he ended had that both the shores resounded feeling the fit that him forewarned to die with lofty flight above the earth he bounded and out of sighed to highest heaven mounted where now he is become and heavenly sign there now the joy is his here sorrow mine 2 whilst thus i looked lo adown the lee i saw and harp strong all with silver twine and made of gold and costly ivory swimming that whilom seemed to have been the harp on which dan orpheus was seen wild beasts and forests after him to led but was th'harpe of philisides now dead at length out of the river it was reared ad born above the clouds to be divined while all the way most heavenly noise was herd of the strings stirred with the warbling wind that wrought both joy and sorrow in my mind so now in heaven a sign it does appear the harp well known beside the northern bear 3 soon after this i saw on th'other side a curious coffer made of ebony wood that in it did most precious treasure hide exceeding all this baser world's good yet through the overflowing of the flood it almost drowned was and done to nought that sighed thereof much grieved my pensive thought at length when most in peril it was brought two angels down descending with swift flight out of the swelling stream it lightly caught and betwixt their blessed arms it carried quite above the reach of any living sighed so now it is transformed into that star in which all heavenly treasures locked are 4 looking aside i saw a stately bed adorned all with costly cloth of gold that might for any princes couch be read and decked with dainty flowers as if it should be for some bride her joyous night to hold therein a goodly virgin sleeping lay a fairer wight saw never summer's day i herd a voice that called far away and her awaking bade her quickly dight for lo her bridegroom was in ready ray to come to her and seek her loves delight with that she started up with cheerful sighed when suddenly both bed and all was gone and i in languor left there all alone 5 still as i gazed i beheld where stood a knight all armed upon a winged steed the same that was bred of medusaes blood on which dan perseus born of heavenly seed the fair andromeda from peril freed full mortally this knight wounded was that streams of blood forth flowed on the grs yet was he decked small joy to him alas with many garlands for his victories and with rich spoils which late he did purchase through brave achievements from his enemies fainting at last through long infirmities he smote his steed that straight to heaven him boar and left me here his loss for to deplore 6 lastly i saw and ark of purest gold upon a brazen pillar standing high which ashes seemed of some great prince to hold enclosed therein for endless memory of him whom all the world did glorify seemed the heavens with the earth did disagree whither should of those ashes keeper be at last me seemed wing footed mercurie from heaven descending to appease their strife the ark did bear with him above the sky and to those ashes gave a second life to live in heaven where happiness is rye at which the earth did grieve exceedngly and i for dole was almost like to die l envoy immortal spirit of philisides which now art made the heavens ornament that whilom wast the world's chiefst riches give leave to him that lou'de thee to lament his loss by lack of thee to heaven hent and with last duties of this broken verse broken with sighs to deck thy sable hearse and you fair lady th'honor of your days and glory of the world your high thoughts scorn vouchsafe this monument of his last praise with some few silver dropping tears adorn and as you be of heavenly off spring born so unto heaven let your high mind aspire and loath this dross of sinull world's desire finis the tears of the muses by ed sp london imprinted for vvilliam ponsonbie dwelling in paules churchyard at the sign of the bishops head 1591. to the right honourable the lady strange most brave and noble lady the things that make you so much honoured of the world as you be are such as without my simple lines testimony are throughly known to all men namely your excellent beauty your virtuous behaviour & your noble match with that most honourable lord the very pattern of right nobility but the causes for which you have thus deserved of me to be honoured if honour it be at all are both your particular bounties and also some private bans of affinity which it hath pleased your ladyship to acknowledge of which when as i found my self in no part worthy i devised this last slender means both to intimate my humble affection to your ladyship and also to make the same universally known to the world that by honouring you they might know me and by knowing me they might honour you vouch safe noble lady to accept this simple remembrance though not worthy of your self yet such as perhaps by good acceptance thereof you may hereafter cull out a more meet & memorable evidence of your own excellnt deserts so recommending the same to your ladyships good liking i humbly take leave your la humbly eve ed. sp the tears of the muses rehearse to me you sacred sisters nine the golden brood of great apolloes wit those piteous plaints and sorrowful sad tine which late you poured forth as you did fit beside the silver springs of helicone making your music of hart-breaking moan for since the time that phoebus foolish son ythundered through ioues avengeful wrath for traversing the chariot of the sun beyond the compass of his pointed path of you his mournful sisters was lamented such mournful tunes were never since invented nor since that fair calliope did loose her loved twins the darlings of her joy her palici whom her unkindly foes the fatal sisters did for spite destroy whom all the muses did bewail long space was ever herd such wailing in this place for all their groves which with the heavenly noyss of their sweet instruments were wont to found and hollow hills from which their silver voices were wont redoubled echoes to rebound did now rebound with nought but rueful cries and yelling shrieks thrown up into the skies the trembling steams which wont in channels clear to romble gently down with murmur soft and were by them right tuneful taught to bear a bases part among their consorts oft now forced to overflow with brackish tears with troublous noise did dull their dainty ears the joyous nymphs and lightfoot fairies which thither came to hear their music sweet and to the measure of their melodies did learn to move their nimble shifting feet now hearing them so heavily lament like heavily lamenting from them went and all that else was wont to work delight through the divine infusion of their skill and all that else seemed fair and fresh in sighed so made by nature for to serve their will was turned now to dismal heaviness was turned now to dreadful ugliness ay me what thing on earth that all thing breeds might be the cause of so impatient plighted what fury or what end with felon deeds hath stirred up so mischievous despite can grief then enter into heavenly hearts and pierce immortal breasts with mortal smarts vouchsafe you then whom only it concerns to me those secret causes to display for none but you or who of you it learns can rightfully aread so doleful lay begin thou eldest sister of the crew and let the rest in order thee ensue clio. hear thou great father of the gods on high that most art dreaded for thy thunder darts and thou our sire that reignest in castalie and mount parnasse the god of goodly arts hear and behold the miserable state of us thy daughters doleful desolate behold the fowl reproach and open shame the which is day by day unto us wrought by such as hate the honour of our name the foes of learning and each gentle thought they not contented us themselves to scorn do seek to make us of the world forlorn ne only they that dwell in lowly dust the sons of darkness and of ignorance but they whom thou great ioue by doom unjust didst to the type of honour erst advance they now puffed up with sdainful insolence despise the brood of blessed sapience the sectaries of my celestial skill that wont to be the world's chief ornament and learned imps that wont to shoot up still and grow to hight of kingdoms government they underkeep and with their spreading arms do beatrice their buds that perish through their harms it most behooves the honourable raze of mighty peers true wisdom to sustain and with their noble countenance to grace the learned foreheads without gifts or gain or rather learned themselves behooves to be that is the garland of nobility but ah all otherwise they do esteem of heavenly gift of wisdoms influence and to be learned it a base thing deem base minded they that want intelligence for god himself for wisdom most is praised and men to god thereby are nighest raised but they do only strive themselves to raise through pompous pride and foolish vanity in eyes of people they put all their praise and only boast of arms and ancestry but virtuous deeds which did those arms first give to their grandsyres they care not to achiue so i that do all noble feats profese to register and found in trump of gold through their bad doings or base slothfulness find nothing worthy to be writ or told for better far it were to hide their names than telling them to blazon out their blames so shall succeeding ages have no light of things forepast nor monuments of time and all that in this world is worthy hight shall die in darkness and lie hid in slime therefore i mourn with deep hearts sorrowing because i nothing noble have to sing with that she reigned such store of streaming tears that could have made a stony heart to weep and all her sisters rend their golden hears and their fair faces with salt humour steep so ended she and then the next anew began her grievous plaint as does ensue melpomene o who shall pour into my swollen eyes a sea of tears that never may be dryde a brazen voice that may with shrilling cries pierce the dull heavens and fill the air wide and iron sides that sighing may endure to wail the wretchedness of world impure ah wretched world the den of wickedness deformed with filth and fowl iniquity ah wretched world the house of heaviness filled with the wreaks of mortal misery ah wretched world and all that is therein the vassals of gods wrath and slaves of since most miserable creature under sky man without understanding does appear for all this world's affliction he thereby and fortune's freaks is wisely taught to bear of wretched life the only joy she is and only comfort in calamities she arms the breast with constant patience against the bitter throws of dolours darts she solaceth with rules of sapience the gentle minds in midst of worldly smarts when he is sad she seeks to make him merry and does refresh his sprights when they be weary but he that is of reasons skill bereft and wants the staff of wisdom him to stay is like a ship in midst of tempest left withouten helm or pilo her to sway full sad and dreadful is that ships event so is the man that wants intendiment why then do foolish men so much despise the precious store of this celestial riches why do they banish us that patronise the name of learning most unhappy wretches the which lie drowned in deep wretchedness yet do not see their own unhappiness my part it is and my professed skill the stage with tragic buskin to adorn and fill the scene with plaint and outcries shrill of wretched persons to misfortune born but none more tragic matter i can find than this of men deprived of sense and mind for all men life me seems a tragedy full of sad sights and soar catastrophees first coming to the world with weeping eye where all his days like dolorous trophies are heaped with spoils of fortune and of fear and he at last laid forth on baleful bear so all with rueful spectacles is filled fit for megera or persephone but i that in true tragedies am skilled the flower of wit find nought to busy me therefore i mourn and pitifully moan because that mourning matter i have none then gan she woefully to wail and wring her wretched hands in lamentable wise and all her sisters thereto answering threw forth loud shricks and dreary doleful cries so rested she and then the nxt in rew began her grievous plaint as does ensue thalia where e the sweet delights of learning's treasure that wone with comic sock to beautify the painted theaters and fill with pleasure the listeners eyes and ears with melody in which i late was wont to rain as queen and mask in mirth with graces well befeeue oh all is gone and all that goodly glee which wont to be the glory of gay wits is laid abed and no where now to see and in her room unseemly sorrow sits with hollow brows and greisly countenance marring my joyous gentle dalliance and him beside sits ugly barbarism and brutish ignorance ycrept of late out of dreaded darkness of the deep abysm where being bred he light and heaven does hate they in the minds of men now tyrannise and the fair scene with rudeness foul disguise all places they with folly have possessed and with vain toys the vulgar entertain but me have banished with all the rest that whilom wont to wait upon my train fine counterfeisance and vnhurtfll sport delight and laughter decked in seemly sort all these and all that else the comic stage with seasoned wit and goodly pleasance graced by which men life in his likest image was limned forth are wholly now defaced and those sweet wits which wont the like to frame are now despizd and made a laughing game and he the man whom nature self had made to mock her self and truth to imitate with kindly counter under mimic shade our pleasant willy ah is dead of late with whom all joy and jolly merriment is also deadened and in dolour drowned in stead thereof scoffing scurrility and scornful folly with contempt is crept rolling in rhymes of shameless ribaudrie without regard or due decorum kept each idle wit at will presumest to make and does the learneds task upon him take but that same gentle spirit from whose pen large streams of honey and sweet nectar flow scorning the boldness of such baseborn men which dare their follies forth so rashly throw does rather choose to fit in idle cell than so himself to mockery to fell so am i made the servant of the many and laughing stock of all that list to scorn not honoured nor cared for of any but loathed of lozels as a thing forlorn therefore i mourn and sorrow with the rest until my cause of sorrow be redressed therewith she loudly did lament and shriek pouring forth streams of tears abundantly and all her sisters with compassion like the breaches of her singuls did supply so rested she and then the next in rew began her grievous plaint as does ensue euterpe like as the darling of the summer's pride fair philomele when winter's stormy wrath the goodly fields that erst so gay were died in colours diverse quite despoiled hath all comfortless does hide her cheerless head during the time of that her widowhead so we that erst were wont in sweet accord all places with our pleasant notes to fill whilst favourable times did us afford free liberty to chant our charms at will all comfortless upon the bared bow like woeful culvers do fit wailing now for far more bitter storm than winter's stour the beauty of the world hath lately wasted and those fresh buds which wont so fair to flower hath marred quite and all their blossoms blasted and those young plants which wont with fruit abound now without fruit or leaves are to be found a stony coldness hath benumbed the sense and lively spirits of each living wight and dimmed with darkness their intelligence darkness more than cymerians daily night and monstrous error flying in the air hath marred the face of all that seemed fair image of hellish horror ignorance born in the bosom of the black abyss and fed with furies milk for sustenance of his weak infancy begotten amiss by yawning sloth on his own mother night so he his sons both sire and brother hight he armed with blindness and with boldness stout for blind is bold hath our fair light defaced and gathering unto him a ragged rout of fans and satires hath our dwellings razed and our chaste bowers in which all virtue reigned with brutishness and beastly filth hath stained the sacred springs of horsefoot helicon so oft bedewed with our learned lays and speaking streams of pure castalion the famous witness of our wonted praise they trampled have with their fowl footing's trade and like to troubled puddles have them made our pleasant groves which planted were with pains that with our music wont so oft to ring and arbours sweet in which the shepherds swains were wont so oft their pastorals to sing they have cut down and all their pleasance marred that now no pastoral is to be hard in stead of them fowl goblins and shriekowles with fearful howling doe all places fill and feeble echo now laments and howls the dreadful accents of their outcries shrill so all is turned into wilderness whilst ignorance the muses does oppress and i whose joy was erst with spirit full to teach the warbling pipe to found aloft my spirits now dismayed with sorrow dull do moan my misery in silence soft therefore i mourn and wail incessantly till please the heavens afford me remedy therewith she wailed with exceeding woe and piteous lamentation did make and all her sisters seeing her do so with equal plaints her sorrow did partake so rested she and then the next in rew began her grievous plaint as does ensue terpsihore who so hath in the lap of soft delight been long time lulled and fed with pleasures sweet fearless through his own fault or fortune's spite to tumble into sorrow and regreet if chance him fallen into calamity finds greater burden of his misery so we that erst in joyance did abound and in the bosom of all bliss did fit like virgin queens with laurel garlands crowned for virtues meed and ornament of wit sith ignorance our kingdom did confound be now become most wretched wights on ground and in our royal thrones which lately stood in th'hearts of men to rule them careully he now hath placed his accursed brood by him begotten of fowl infamy blind error scornful folly and base spite who hold by wrong that we should have by right they to the vulgar word now pipe and sing and make them merry with their fooleries they cherelie chant and rhymes at random fling the fruitful spawn of their rank fantaies they feed the ears of fools with flattery and good men blame and lozels magnify all places they do with their toys possess and reign in liking of the multitude the schools they fill with found new fangleness and sway in court with pride and rashness rude amongst simple shepherds they do boast their skill and say their music matches phoebus quill the noble hearts to pleasures they allure and tell their prince that learning is but vain fair ladies loves they spot with thoughts impure and gentle minds with lewd delights distain clerks they to loathly idleness entice and fill their books with discipline of vice so every where they rule and tyrannise for their usurped kingdoms maintenance the while we silly maids whom they dispize and with reproachful scorn discountenance from our own native heritage exiled walk through the world of every one reviled nor any one does care to call us in or once vouchsafeth us to entertain unless some one perhaps of gentle kin for pities sake compassion our pain and yield us some relief in this distress yet to be so relieved is wrechednesse so wander we all careful comfortless yet none does care to comfort us at all so seek we help our sorrow to redress yet none vouchsafes to answer to our call therefore we mourn and pitiless complain because none living pitieth our pain with that she wept and woefully waimented that nought on earth her grief might pacify and all the rest her doleful din augmented with shrieks and groans and grievous agony so ended she and then the next in rew began her piteous plaint as does ensue erato you gentle spirits breathing from above where you in venus silver bower were bred thoughts half divine full of the fire of love with beauty kindled and with pleasure fed which you now in security possess forgetful of your former heaviness now change the tenor of your joyous lays with which you use your loves to deify and blazon forth and earthly beauty's praise above the compass of the arched sky now change your praises into piteous cies and eulogies turn into elegies such as you wont whenas those bitter stounds of raging love first gan you to torment and launch your hearts with lamentable wounds of secret sorrow and sad languishment before your loves did take you unto grace those now renew as fitter for this place for i that rule in measure moderate the tempest of that stormy passion and use to pait in is the troublous state of lovers li in like aion am put fom my ndlie skill banished by to with lewdness fill love wont to b schoolmaster of my skill and the deviceful matter of my song sweet love devoid of villainy or ill but pure and spotle as at first he sprung out of th'almighties bosom where he nests from thence infused into mortal breasts such high conceit of that celestial fire the baseborn brood of blindness cannot guess n ever dare their dunghill thoughts aspire unto so lofty pitch of perfectnese but rhyme at riot and do rage in love yet little wot what does thereto behoove fair cytheree the mother of delight and queen of beauty now thou mayest go pack for lo thy kingdom is dead quite thy sceptre rend and power put to wrack and thy gay son that winged god of love may now go prune his plumes like ruffed dove and you three twins to light by venus brought the sweet companions of the muses late from whom whatever thing is goodly thought does borrow grace the fancy to aggrate go beg with us and be companions still as heretofore of good so now of ill for neither you nor we shall any more find entertainment or in court or school for that which was accounted heretofore the learneds meed is now lent to the fool he sings of love and makes loving lays and they them hear and they them highly praise with that she poured forth a brackish flood of bitter tears and made exceeding moan and all her sisters seeing her sad mood with loud laments her answered all at one so ended she and then the next in rew began her grievous plaint as does ensue calliope to whom shall i my evil case complain or tell the anguish of my inward smart sith none is left to remedy my pain or deigns to pity a perplexed heart but rather seeks my sorrow to augment with fowl reproach and cruel banishment for they to whom i used to apply the faithful service of my learned skill the goodly offspring of ioues progeny that wont the world with famous acts oh fill whose living praises in heroïck style it is my chief profession to compile they all corrupted through the rust of time that does all fairest things on earth deface or through unnoble sloth or sinful rain that does degenerate the noble raze have both desire of worthy deeds forlorn and name of learning utterly do scorn ne do they care to have the ancestry of th'old heroes memorizde anew ne do they care that late posterity should know their names or speak their praises due but die forgotten from whence at first they sprung as they themselves shall forgotten ere long what boots it then to come from glorious forefathers or to have been nobly bred what odds betwixt irus and old inachus betwixt best and worst when both alike are dead if none of neither mention should make nor out of dust their memories awake or who would ever care to do brave deed or strive in virtue others to excel if none should yield him his deserved meed due praise that is the spur of doing well for if good were not praised more than ill none would choose goodness of his own freewill therefore the nurse of virtue i am hight and golden trumpet of eternite that lowly thoughts lift up to heavens hight and mortal men have pour to deify bacchus and hercules i raised to heaven and charlemaine among the starris seauen but now i will my golden clarion rend and will henceforth immortalise no more sith i no more find worthy to commend for prize of valve or for learned lore for noble peers whom i was wont to raise now only seek for pleasure nought for praise their great revenues all in sumptuous pride they spend that nought to learning they may spare and the rich fee which poets wont divide now parasites and sycophants do share therefore i mourn and endless sorrow make both for my self and for my sisters sake with that she loudly gan to wail and shriek and from her eyes a sea of tears did pour and all her sisters with compassion like did more increase the sharpness of her shower so ended she and then the next in rew began her plaint as does herein ensue vrania what wrath of gods or wicked influence of stars conspiring wretched men afflict hath poured on earth this noyous pestilence that mortal minds does inwardly infect with love of blindness and of ignorance to dwell in darkness without souerance what difference betwixt man and beast is left when heavenly light of knowledge is put out and th'ornaments of wisdom are bereft then wanders he in error and in doubt unweeting of the danger he is in through fleshes frailty and deceit of since in this wide world in which they wretches stray it is the only comfort which they have it is their light their loadstar and their day but hell and darkness and the grisly graven is ignorance the enemy of grace that minds of men born heavenly does debace through knowledge we behold the world's creation how in his cradle first he fostered was and judge of nature's cunning operation how things she formed of a formless mass by knowledge we do learn our selves to know and what to man and what to god we owe from hence we mount aloft unto the sky and look into the crystal firmament there we behold the heavens great hierarchy the stars pure light the spheres swift movement the spirits and intelligences fair and angels weighting on th'almighties chair and there with humble mind and high insight th'eternall makers majesty we view his love his truth his glory and his might and mercy more than mortal men can view oh sovereign lord o sovereign happiness to see thee and thy mrcie measureless such happiness have they that do embrace the precepts of my heavenly discipline but shame and sorrow and accursed case have they that scorn the school of arts divine and banish me which do profess the skill to make men heavenly wise through humbled will how ever yet they me despise and spite i feed on sweet contentment of my thought and please my self with mine own self-delight in contemplation of things heavenly wrought so loathing earth i look up to the sky and being driven hence i thither fly thence i behold the misery of men which want the bliss that wisdom would them breed and like brutus beasts do lie in loathsome den of ghostly darkness and of ghastly dread for whom i mourn and for my self complain and for my sisters eake whom they disdain with that she wept and wailed so pityouslie as if her eyes had been two springing wells and all the rest her sorrow to supply did throw forth shrieks and cries and dreery yells so ended she and then the next in rew began her mournful plaint as does ensue polyhymnia a doleful case desires a doleful song without vain art or curious compliments and squalid fortune into baseness flung does scorn the pride of wonted ornaments then fittest are these ragged rhymes for me to tell my sorrows that exceeding bee for the sweet numbers and melodious measures with which i wont the winged words to tie and make a fruitful diapase of pleasures now being let to run at liberty by those which have no skill to rule them right have now quite lost their natural delight heaps of huge words vphoorded hideously with horrid found though having little sense they think to be chief praise of poëtry and thereby wanting due intelligence have marred the face of goodly poësie and made a monster of their fantasy whilom in ages passed none might profess but princes and high priests that secret skill the sacred laws therein they wont express and with deep oracles their verses fill then was she held in sovereign dignity and made the nursling of nobility but now nor prince nor priest does her maintain but suffer her prophaned for to be of the base vulgar that with hands unclean dares to pollute her hidden mystery and treadeth under foot his holy things which was the care of kesars and of kings one only lives her ages ornament and mirror of her makers majesty that with rich bounty and deer cherishment supports the praise of noble poësie ne only favours them which it profess but is her self a peerless poëtresse most peerless prince most peerless poëtresse the true pandora of all heavenly graces divine elisa sacred empress live she for ever and her royal p'laces be filled with praises of divinest wits that her eternise with their heavenly writs some few beside this sacred skill esteem admirers of her glorious excellence which being lightened with her beauties beam are thereby filled with happy influence and lifted up above the world's gaze to sing with angels her immortal praise but all the rest as born of salvage brood and having been with acorns always fed can no whit savour this celestial food but with base thoughts are into blindness led and kept from looking on the lightsome day for whom i wail and weep all that i may eftsoones such store of tears she forth did pour as if she all to water would have gone and all her sisters seeing her sad stour did weep and wail and made exceeding moan and all their learned instruments did break the st vntod no long tongue can speak finis virgils gnat long since dedicated to the most noble and excellent lord the earl of leicester late deceased wronged yet not daring to express my pain to you great lord the causer of my care in cloudy tears my case i thus complain unto yourself that only privy are but if that any odipus unware shall chance through power of some divining spright to read the secret of this riddle rare and know the purport of my evil plighted let him rest pleased with his own insight ne further seek to gloze upon the text for grief enough it is to grieved wight to feel his fault and not be further vexed but what so by my self may not be shown may by this gnats complaint be easily known we now have played augustus wantonly tuning our song unto a tender muse and like a cobweb weaving slenderly have only played let thus much then excuse this gnats small poem that whole history is but a jest though envy it abuse but who such sports and sweet delights does blame shall lighter eeme than this gnats idle name hereafter when as season more secure shall bring forth fruit this muse shall speak to thee in bigger notes that may thy sense allure and for thy worth frame some fit poesy the golden offspring of latona pure and ornament of great ioues progeny phoebus shall be the author of my song playing on ivory harp with silver strong he shall inspire my verse with gentle mood of poets prince whither he won beside fair xanthus sprinkled with chimaeras blood or in the woods of astery abide or whereas mount parnasse the muses brood does his broad forehead like two horns divide and the sweet waves of sounding castaly with liquid foot does slide down easily wherefore you sisters which the glory be of the pierian streams fair naiades go too and dancing all in company adorn that god and thou holy pales to whom the honest care of husbandry returns by continual success have care for to pursue his footing light through the wide woods & groves with green leaves dight professing thee i lifted am aloft betwixt the forest wide and starry sky and thou most dread octauius which oft to learned wits givest courage worthily oh come thou sacred child come sliding soft and favour my beginnings graciously for not these leaves do sing that dreadful stound when giants blood did stain phlegraean ground nor how half horsy people centaur's hight fought with the bloody lapithaes at board nor how the east with tyrannous despite burned th'attick towers and people slew with sword nor how mount athos through exceeding might was dug down nor iron bans aboard the pontic sea by their huge navy cast my volume shall renown so long since past nor hellespont trampled with horses feet when flocking persians did the greeks affray but my soft muse as for her power more meet delights with phoebus friendly leave to play and easy running verse with tender feet and thou dread sacred child to thee always let everlasting lightsome glory strive through the world's endless ages to survive and let and happy room remain for thee amongst heavenly ranks where blessed souls do rest and let long lasting life with joyous glee as thy due meed that thou deservest best hereafter many years remembered be among good men of whom thou oft are blessed live thou for ever in all happiness but let us turn to our first business the fiery sun was mounted now on hight up to the heavenly towers and shot each where out of his golden chariot glistering light and fair aurora with her rosy hear the hateful darkness now had put to flight when as the shepherd seeing day appear his little goats gan driven out of their stalls to feed abroad where pasture best befalls to and high mountains top he with them went where thickest grass did cloth the open hills they now among the woods and thickets meant now in the valleys wandering at their wills spread themselves far abroad through each descent some on the soft green grass feeding their fills some clambering through the hollow cliffs on high nibble the bushy shrubs which grow thereby others the utmost boughs of trees do crop and bronze the woodbine twigs that freshly bud this with full bit does cath the utmost top of some soft willow or new grown stud this with sharp teeth the bramble leaves does lop and chaw the tender prickles in her cud the while another high does overlook her own like image in a crystal brook o the great happiness which shepherds have who so loathes not too much the poor estate with mind that ill use does before deprave ne measures all things by the costly rate of riotise and semblants outward brave no such sad cares as wont to macerate and rend the greedy minds of covetous men do ever creep into the shepherds den ne cares he if the flece which him arrays be not twice steeped in assyrian die ne glistering of gold which underlays the summer beams do blind his gazing eye ne pictures beauty nr the glancing rays of precious stones whence no good comes by ne yet his cup embossed with imagery of baetus or of alcons vanity ne ought the whelky pearls esteems he which are from indian seas brought far away but with pure breast from careful sorrow free on the soft grass his limbs does oft display in sweet spring time when flowers variety with sundry colours paints the sprinkled lay there lying all at ease from guile or spite with pipe of fenny redes does him delight there he lord of himself with palm bedight his looser locks does wrap in wreathe of vine there his milk dropping goats be his delight and fruitful pales and the forest green and darksome caves in pleasant valleys pight whereas continual shade is to be seen and where fresh springing wells as crystal neat do always flow to quench his thirsty heat o who can led then a more happy life than he that with clean mind and hear sincere no greedy riches knows nor bloody strife no deadly fight of warlike fleet does fear ne runs in peril of foes cruel knife that in the sacred temples he may rear a trophy of his glittering spoils and treasure or may abound in riches above measure of him his god is worshipped with his sith and not with skill of craftsman polished he joys in groves and makes himself full blithe with sundry flowers in wild fields gathered ne frankincens he from panchaea buyth sweet quiet harbours in his harmless head and perfect pleasure builds her joyous bower free from sad cares that rich men's hearts devour this all his care this all his whole endeavour to this his mind and senses he does bend how he may flow in quiets matchless treasure content with any food that god does send and how his limbs resolved through idle leisour unto sweet sleep he may securely lend in some cool shadow from the scorching heat the while his flock their chawed cuds do eat oh flocks oh fans and oh you pleasant springs of tempe where the country nymphs are rife through whose not costly care each shepherd sings as merry notes upon his usticke fife as that astraean barred whose fame now rings through the wide world and leads as joyful life free from all troubles and from worldly toil in which found men do all their days turmoil in such delights while thus his careless time this shepherd drives upleaning on his batt and on shrill redes chanting his rustic rhyme hyperion throwing forth his beams full hot into the highest top of heaven gan climb and the world parting by and equal lot did shed his whirling flames on either side as the great oean does himself divide then gan the shepherd gather into one his straggling goats and drove them to a ford whose caerule stream rambling in bible stone crept under moss as green as any goord now had the sun half heaven overgone when he his herd back from that water ford drove from the force of phoebus boiling ray into thick shadows there themselves to lay soon as he them placed in thy sacred wood oh delian goddess saw to which of yore came the bad daughter of old cadmus brood cruel agaue flying vengeance soar of king nictileus for the guilty blood which she with cursed hands had shed before there she half frantic having slain her son did shroud her self like punishment to shun here also playing on the grassy green woodgods and satires and swift dryades with many fairies oft were dancing seen not so much did dan orpheus repress the streams of hebrus with his songs i ween as that fair troop of woody goddesses stayed thee oh peneus powering forth to thee from cheerful looks great mirth & gladsome glee the very nature of the place resounding with gentle murmur of the breathing air a pleasant bower with all delight abounding in the fresh shadow did for them prepare to rest their limbs with weariness redounding for first the high palm trees with branches air out of the lowly valleys did arise and high shoot up their heads into the skies and them among the wicked lotos grew wicked for holding guilefully away vlysses men whom rapt with sweetness new taking to host it quite from him did stay and eke those trees in whose transformed hew the suns sad daughters waylde the rash decay of phaeton whose limbs with lightning rend they gathering up with sweet ears did lament and that same tree in which demophoon by his disloyalty lamnted soar eternal hurt left unto many one whom also accompanied the oak of yore through fatal charms transformed to such and one the oak whose acorns were our food before that ceres seed of mortal men were known which first triptoleme taught how to be sown here also grow the rougher rinded pine the great argoan ships brave ornament whom golden fleece did make and heavenly sign which coueing with his high tops extent to make the mountains touch the stars divine decks all the forest with embellishment and the black holm that loves the watery vale and the sweet cyprese sign of deadly bale amongst the rest the clambering yue grew knitting his wanton arms with grasping hold lest that the poplar happily should rew her brother's strokes whose boughs she does enfold with her lythe twigs till they the top survew and paint with pallid green her buds of gold next did the myrtle tree to her approach not yet unmindful of her old reproach but the small birds in their wide boughs embowring chanted their sundry tunes with sweet consent and under them a silver spring forth powering his trickling streams a gentle murmur sent thereto the frogs bred in the slimy scouring of the moist moors their jarring voices bent and shrill grasshoppers chirped them around all which the airy echo did resound in this so pleasant place this speeards flock lay every where their weary limbs to rest on every bush and eerie hollow rock where breathe on them the whistling wind mote best the while the shepherd self tending his stock sat by the fountain side in shade to rest where gentle slumbering sleep oppressed him displayed on ground and seized every im of treachery or trains nought took he keep but loosely on the grassy green dispread his dearest life did trust to careless sleep which weighing down his drooping drowsy head in quiet rest his melted heart did steep devoid of care and fear of all falsehood had not inconstant fortune bent to ill bid strange mischance his quietness to spill for at his wonted time in that same place and huge great serpent all with speckles pide to drench himself in moorish slime did trace there from the boiling heat himself to hide he passing by with rolling wreathed pace with brandished tongue the empty air did gride and wrapped his scaly boughts with fell despite that all things seemed appalled at his sighed now more and more having himself enolde his glittering breast he lifts up on high and with proud vaunt his head aloft does hold his crest above spotted with purple die on every side did shine like scaly gold and his bright eyes glancing full dreadfully did seem to flame out flakes of flashing fire and with stern looks to threaten kindled ire thus wise long time he did himself dispace there round about when as at last he spied lying along before him in that place that flocks grand captain and most trusty guide etsoones more fierce in visage and in pace throwing his firy eyes on every idem he comes on and all things in his way full sternly rends that might his passage stay much he disdains that any one should dare to come unto his haunt for which intent he inly burns and begins straight to prepare the weapons which nature to him hath lent felly he hisseth and does fiercely stare and hath his jaws with angry spirits rend that all his tract with bloody drops is stained and all his folds are now in length outstrained whom thus at point prepared to prevent a little nursling of the humid air a gnat unto the sleepy shepherd went and marking where his eyelids twinkling rare showed the two pearls which sighed unto him lent through their thin coverings appearing fair his little needle there infixing deep warned him awake from death himself to keep wherewith enraged he fiercely gan upstarted and with his hand him rashly bruising slew as in avengement of his heedless smart that straight the spirit out of his senses w and life out of his members did depart when suddenly casting aside his view he spied his foe with felonous intent and fervent eyes to his destruction bent all suddenly dismayed and hartles quite he fled aback and catching hasty hold of a young alder hard beside him pight it rend and straight about him gan behold what god or fortune would assist his might but whither god or fortune made him bold its hard to read yet hardy will he had to overcome that made him less dreaded the scaly back of that most hideous snake enwrapped round oft feigning to retire and oft him to assail he fiercely strake whereas his temples did his crest front tyre and for he was but slow did sloth off shake and gazing ghastly on for fear and ire had blended so much his sense that less he feared yet when he saw him slain himself he cheered by this the night forth from the darksome bower of herebus her teemed steeds gan call and lazy vesper in his timely hour from golden oeta gan proceed withal whenas the shepherd after this sharp stour sing the doubled shadows low to fallen gathering his straying flock does homeward fare and unto rest his weary joints prepare into whose sense so soon as lighter sleep was entered and now losing every limb sweet slumbering dew in carelessness did steep the image of that gnat appeared to him and in sad terms gan sorrowfully weep with greislie countenance and visage grim wailing the wrong which he had done of late in steed of good hastening his cruel fate said he what have i wretch deserved that thus into this bitter bale i am outcast whilst that thy life more deer and precious was than mine own so long as it did last i now in lieu of pains so gracious am tossed in the with every windy blast thou safe delivered from sad decay thy careless limbs in lose sleep dost display so livest thou but my poor wretched ghost is forced to ferry over lethes river and spoiled of charon too and from am tossed seest thou how all places quake and quiver lightened with deadly lamps on every post tisiphone ach where does shake and shiver her flaming fire brand encountering me whose locks uncombed cruel adders be and cerberus whose many mouths do bay and bark out flames as if on fire he fed adown whose neck in terrible array ten thousand snakes cralling about his head do hang in heaps that horribly array and bloody eyes do glister firy read he oftentimes me dreadfully does threaten with painful torments to be sorely beaten ay me that thanks so much should ail of meed for that i thee restored to life again even from the door of death and deadly dread where then is now the guerdon of my pain where the reward of my so piteous deed the praise of pity vanished is in vain and th'antique faith of justice long ago out of the land is fled away and gone i saw another's fate approaching fast and left mine own his safety to tender into the same mishap i now am cast and shunned destruction does destruction render not unto him that never hath trespast but punishment is due to the offender yet let destruction be the punishment so long as thankful will may it relent i carried am into waste wilderness waste wilderness among cymerian shades where endless pains and hideous heaviness is round about me heaped in darksome glades for there huge othos sits in sad distress fast bound with serpents that him oft invades far of beholding ephialtes tide which once assayed to burn this world so wide and there is mournful tityus mindful yet of thy displeasure oh latona fair displeasure too implacable was it that made him meat for wild fowls of the air much do i fear among such fiends to fit much do i fear back to them to repair to the black shadows of the stygian shore where wretched ghosts fit wailing evermore there next the utmost brink does he abide that did the banquets of the gods bewray whose threat through thirst to nought nigh being dried his sense to seek for ease turns every way and he that in avengement of his pride for scorning to the sacred gods to pray against a mountain rolls a mighty stone calling in vain for rest and can have none go y with them go cursed damosels whose bridal torches foul erynnis tined and hymen at your spousals and foretells tidings of death and massacre unkind with them that cruel colchid mother dwells the which conceived in her revengeful mind with bitter wounds her own deer babes to slay and murdered troops upon great heaps to lay there also those two pandionian maids calling on itis itis evermore whom wretched boy they slew with guilty blades for whom the thracian king lamenting soar turned to a lapwing foully them upbraids and flattering round about them still does soar there now they all eternally complain of others wrong and suffer endless pain but the two brothers born of cadmus blood while each does for the sovereignty contend blind through ambition and with vengeance wood each does against the others body bend his cursed steel of neither well withstood and with wide wounds their carcases does rend that yet they both do mortal foes remain sith each with brother's bloody hand was slain ah waladay there is no end of pain nor change of labour may entreated be yet i beyond all these am carried feign where other powers far different i see and must pass over to th'elisian plain there grim persephone ncountring me does urge her fellow furies earnestly with their bite firebronds me to terrify there chaste aeste lives inviolate free from all care for that her husbands days she did prolong by changing fate for fate lo there lives also the immortal praise of womankind most faithful to her mate penelope and from her far aways a rulesse rout of youngmen which her wooed all slain with darts lie wallowed in their blood and sad eurydie thence now no more must turn to life but there detained be for looking back being forbid before yet was the guilt thereof orpheus in thee bold sure he was and worthy spirit boar that durst those lowest shadows go to see and could believe that any thing could please fell cerberus or stygian powers appease ne feared the burning was of phlegeton nor those same mournful kingdoms compassed with

upbraid fled back to heaven whence she was first conceived into her silver bower the sun received and the hight syrian dog on him awaiting after the chafed lyons cruel baiting corrupted had the with his noisome breath and poured on earth plague pestilence and death amongst the rest a wicked malady reigned amongst men that many did to die deprived of sense and ordinary reason that it to leaches seemed strange and gason my fortune was amongst many others more to be partaker of their common woe and my weak body set on fire with grife was robbed of rest and natural relief in this ill plighted there came to visit me some friends who sorry my sad case to see began to comfort me in cheerful wise and means of gladsome solace to devise but seeing kindly sleep refuse to do his office and my feeble eyes forgo they sought my troubled sense how to deceau with talk that might unquiet fancies reau and sitting all in seats about me round with pleasant tales fit for that idle stound they cast in course to waste the weary hours some told of ladies and their paramours some of brave knights and their renowned squires some of the fairies and their strange attires and some of giants hard to be believed that the delight thereof me much relieved among the rest a good old woman was hight mother hubberd who did far surpass the rest in honest mirth that seemed her well she when her turn was come her tale to tell told of a strange adventure that betided betwixt the fox and th'ape by him misguided the which for that my sense it greatly pleased all were my spirit heavy and diseased i'll write in terms as she the same did say so well as i her words remember may no muses aid me needs here too to call base is the style and matter mean withal ¶ whilom said she before the world was civil the fox and th'ape disliking of their evil and hard estate determined to seek their fortune's far abroad lyeke with his lyeke for both were crafty and unhappy witted two fellows might no where be better fitted the fox that first this cause of grief did find gan first thus plain his case with words unkind neighbour ape and my goship eke beside both two sure bans in friendship to be tide to whom may i more trustily complain the evil plighted that does me soar constrain and hope thereof to find due remedy hear then my pain and inward agoie thus many years i now have spent and wrne in mean regard and basest fortune's scorn doing my country service as i might no less i dare say than the proudest wight and still i hoped to be up advanced for my good parts but still it hath mischanced now therefore that no longer hope i see but froward fortune still to follow me and lozels lifted up on high where i did look i mean to turn the next leaf of the book yet ere that any way i do betake i mean my gossip privy first to make ah my deer gossip answered then the ape deeply do your sad words my wits awhape both for because your grief does great appear and eke because my self am touched near for i likewise have wasted much good time still waiting to preferment up to climb whilst others always have before me stepped and from my beard the fat away have swept that now unto despair i gin to grow and mean for better wind about to throw therefore to me my trusty friend aread thy council two is better than one head certes said he i mean me to disguise in some strange habit after uncouth wise or like a pilgrim or a lymiter or like a gipsen or a iuggeler and so to wander to the world's end to seek my fortune where i may it mend for worse than that i have i cannot meet wide is the world i wot and every street is full of fortune's and adventures strange continually subject unto change say my fair brother now if this device does like you or may you to like entice surely said th'ap it likes me wondrous well and would you not poor fellowship expel my self would you t'accompanie in this adventures chauncefull jeopardy for to wax old at home in idleness is disaduenrous and quite fortuneless abroad where change is good may got be the fox was glad and quickly did agree so both esolued the morrow next ensuing so soon as day appeared to peoples vowing on their ourney to proceed and over night whatso thereto did need each did prepare in readiness to be the morrow next so soon as one might see light out of heavens windows forth to look both the hbiliments unto them took and put themselves a gods name on their way whenas the ape beginning well to weigh this hard adventure thus began t'aduise now read sir reynold as you be right wise what course you ween is best for us to take that for our selves we may a lying make whither shall we profess some trade or skill or shall we vary our device at will even as new occasion appears or shall we ie our selves for certain years to any service or to any place for it behooves ere that into the raze we enter to resolve first hereupon now surely brother said the fox anon you have this matter motioned in season for every thing that is begun with reason will come by ready means unto his end but things miscounselled must needs miswend thus therefore i advise upon the case that not to any certain trade or place nor any man we should our selves apply for why should he that is at liberty make himself bound sith then we are free born let us all sruile base subjection scorn and as we be sons of the world so wide let us our father's heritage divide and challenge to our selves our portions due of all the patrimony which a few now hold in hugger mugger in their hand and all the rest do rob of good and land for now a few have all and all have nought yet all be brothers alike dearly bought there is no right in this partition ne was it so by institution ordained first ne by the law of nature but that she gave like blessing to each creature as well of worldly liuelode as of life that there might be no difference nor strife nor ought called mine or thine thrice happy then was the condition of mortal men that was the golden age of saturne old but this might better be the world of gold for without gold now nothing will god therefore if please you this shall our plot we will not be of any occupation let such vile vassals born to base vocation drudge in the world and for their living droil which have no wit to live withouten toil but we will walk about the world at pleasure like two free men and make our ease a treasure free men some beggars call but they be free and they which call them so more beggars be for they do swink and sweae to feed the other who live like lords of that which they do gather and yet do never thank them for the same but as their endue by nature do it claim such will we fashion both our selves to be lords of the world and so will wander free where so us lists uncontrolled of any hard is our hap if we amongst so many light not on some that may our state amend seldom but some good comes ere the end well seemed the ape to like this ordinance yet well considering of the circumstance as pausing in great doubt a while he stayed and afterwards with graven advisement said i cannot my lief brother like but well the purpose of the complot which you tell for well i wot compared to all the rest of each degree that beggars life is best and they that think themselves the best of all ofttimes to begging are content to fallen but this i wot withal that we shall run into great danger like to be undone thus wildly to wander in the world's eye without passport or good warranty for fear lest we like rogues should be reputed and for ear marked beasts abroad be bruited therefore i read that we our counsels call how to prevent this mischief ere it fallen and how we may with most security beg among those that beggars do defy right well deer gossip you advised have said then the fox but i this doubt will save for ere we farther pass i will devise a passport for us both in fittest wise and by the names of soldiers us protect that now is thought a civil begging sect be you the soldier for you likest are for manly semblance and small skill in war i will but wait on you and as occasion falls out my self fit for the same will fashion the passport ended both they forward went the ape clad soldierlike fit for intent in a blue jacket with a cross of red and many slits as if that he had shed much blood through many wounds therein received which had the use of his right arm bereaved upon his head and old scotch cap he wore with a plume feather all to pieces tore his breeches were made after the new cut all portugese lose like and empty gut and his hose broken high above the healing and his shoes beaten out with traveling but neither sword nor dagger he did bear seems that no foes revengement he did fear in stead of them a handsome bat he held on which he leaned as one far in eld shame light on him that through so false illusion does turn the name of soldiers to abusion and that which is the noblest mystery brings to reproach and common infamy long they thus travailed yet never met adventure which might them a working set yet many ways they sought and many tried yet for their purposes none fit espied at last they chanced to meet upon the way a simple husbandman in garments grey yet though his vesture were but mean and base a good yeoman he was of honest place and more for thrift did care than for gay clothing gay without good is good hearts greatest loathing the fox him spying bade the ape him dight to play his part for lo he was in sighed that if he ered not should them entetaine and yield them timely profit for their pain eftsoones the ape himself gan up to rear and on his shoulders high his bat to bear as if good service he were fit to do but little thrift for him he did it too and stoutly forward he his steps did strain that like a handsome sway it him became when as they nigh approached that good man seeing them wander loosely first began t'enquire of custom what and whence they were to whom the ap i am a souldiere that late in wars have spent my dearest blood and in long service lost both limbs and good and now constrained that trade to ouergie i driven am to seek some means to live which might it you in pity please t'afford i would be ready both in deed and word to do you faithful service all my days this iron world that same he weeping says bring down the stoutest hearts to lowest state for misery does bravest minds abate and make them seek for that they wont to scorn of fortune and of hope at once forlorn the honest man that herd him thus complain was grieved as he had felt part of his pain and well disposed him some relief to show asked if in husbandry he ought did know to plough to plant to reap to rake to sow to hedge to ditch to thrash to thetch to mow or to what labour else he was prepared for husbands life is laborous and hard whenas the ape him hard so much to talk of labour that did from his liking balk he would have slipped the collar handsomely and to him said good sir full glad am i to take what pains may any living wight but my late maimed limbs lack wonted might to do their kindly services as needs scarce this right hand the mouth with diet feeds so that it may not painful work endure ne to strong labour can it sele enure but if that any other place you have which asks small pains but thrifnes to save or care to overlook or trust to gather you may me trust as your own ghostly father with that the husbandman gan him avise that it for him were fittest exercise cattell to keep or grounds to oversee and asked him if he could willing be to keep his sheep or to attend his swine or watch his mares or take his charge of kine gladly said he what ever such like pain you put on me i will the same susaine but gladliest i of your fleecy sheep might it you please would take on me the keep for ere that unto arms i me betook unto my father's sheep i used to look that yet the skill thereof i have not lost thereto right well this curdog by my cost meaning the fox will serve my sheep to gather and driven to follow after their bellwether the husbandman was meanly well content trial to make of his endeuourment and home him leading lent to him the charge of all his flock with liberty full large giving account of annual increase both of their lambs and of their woolly fleece thus is this ape become a shepherd swain and the false fox his dog god give them pain for ere the year have half his course outrun and do return from whence he first begun they shall him make and ill account of thrift now whenas time flying with wings swift expired had the term that these two javels should render up a reckoning of their travels unto their master which it of them sought exceedingly they troubled were in thought ne wist what answer unto him to frame ne how to escape great punishment or shame for their false treason and vile thievery for not a lamb of all their flocks supply had they to show but ever as they bred they slew them and upon their fleshes fed for that disguised dog loud blood to spill and drew the wicked shepherd to his will so betwixt them both they not a lambkin left and when lambs failed the old sheeps lives they rest that how acquit themselves unto their lord they were in doubt and flatly set aboard the fox then counseled th'ape for to require respite till morrow answer his desire for times delay new hope of help still breeds the goodman granted doubting nought their and bad next day that all should ready be but they more subtle meaning had than he for the next morrows meed they closely meant for fear of afterclaps for to prevent and that same evening when all shrouded were in careless sleep they without care or fear cruelly fell upon their flock in fold and of them slew at pleasure what they would of which whenas they feasted had their fill for a full compliment of all their ill they stole away and took their hasty flight carried in clouds of all-concealing night so was the husbandman left to his loss and they unto their fortune's change to toss after which sort they wandered long while abusing many through their cloaked guile that at the last they gan to be descryd of every one and all their sleights espied so as their begging now them failed quite for none would give but all men would them wit yet would they take no pains to get their living but seek some other way to gain by giving much like to begging but much better nam for many beg which are thereof ashamed and now the fox had got him a gown and th'ape a cassock sidelong hanging down for they their occupation meant to change and now in other state abroad to range for since their soldiers pass no better sped they forged another as for clerks booke-redd who passing forth as their adventures ell through many haps which needs not here to tell at length chanced with a formal priest to meet whom they in civil manner firs did greet and ater asked and alms for gods deer love the man straight way his choler up did move and with reproachful terms gan them revile for following that trade so base and vile and asked what license or what pass they had ah said the ape as sighing wondrous sad its and hard came when men of good deseuing must either driven be perforce oh starving or asked for their pass by every squib that list at will them to revile or snib and yet god wot small odds i often see betwixt them that ask and them that asked be natheless because you shall not us misdeem but that we are as honest as we seem ye shall our passport at your pleasure see and then you will i hope well moved be which when the priest beheld he viewed it never as if therein some text he studying were but little ls god wot could thereof skill for read he could not evidence nor will ne tell a written word ne write a letter ne make one title worse ne make one btter of such deep learning little had he need ne yet of latin ne of greek that breed doubts amongst divines and difference of texts from whence arise diversity of sects and hateful heresies of god abhorred but this good sir did follow the plain word ne meddled with their controversies vain all his care was his service well to sane and to read homelies upon holidays when that was done he might attend his plays and easy life and fit high god to please he having overlooked their pass at ase gan at the length them to rebuke again that no good trade of life did entertain but lost their time in wandering lose abroad seeing the world in which they bootless boad had ways enough for all therein to live such grace did god unto his creatures give said then the fox who hath the world not tried from the right way full eath may wander wide we are but novices new come abroad we have not yet the tract of any troad nor on us taken any state of life but ready are of any to make preife therefore might please you which the world have proved us to advise which forth but lately moved of some good course that we might undertake you shall for ever us your bondmen make the priest gan wax half proud to be so prayed and thereby willing to afford them aid it seems said he right well that you be clerks both by your wiie words and by your works is not that name enough to make a living to him that hath a whit of nature's giving how many honest men see you arise daily thereby and grow to goodly prize to deanes to archdeacons to commissaries to lords to principals to prebendaries all jolly prelates worthy rule to bear who ever them envy yet spite bites ear why should you doubt then but that you likewise might unto some of those in time arise in the mean time to live in good estate loving that love and hating those that hate being some honest curate or some vicker content with little in condition sicker ah but said th'ape the charge is wondrous great to feed men's souls and hath and heavy threat to feed men's souls quoth he is not in man for they must feed themselves do what we can we are but charged to lay the meat beore eat they that list we need to do no more but god it is that feeds them with his grace the bred of life poured down from heavenly place therefore said he that with the budding rod did rule the iewes all shall taught of god that same hath iesus christ now to him reached by whom the flock is rightly fed and taught he is the shepherd and the priest is he we but his shepherd swains ordained to be therefore herewith do not your self dismay ne is the pains so great but bear you may for not so great as it was wont of yore it's now a days ne half so straight and soar they whilom used duly every day their service and their holy things to say at morn and even beside their anthems sweet their penny masses and their complynes meet their dirges their trentals and their shrifts their memories their singings and their gifts now all those needless works are laid away now once a week upon the sabbath day it is enough to do our small devotion and then to follow any merry motion ne are we tied to fast but when we list ne to wear garments base of woollen twist but with the finest silks us to array that before god we may appear more gay resembling aarons glory in his place for far unfit it is that person base should with vile clothes approach gods maistie whom no uncleanness may approachen nigh or that all men which any master serve good garments for their service should deserve but he that serves the lord of hosts most high and that in highest place t'approach him nigh and all the peoples prayers to present before his throne as on ambassage sent both too and from should not deserve to wear a garment better than of wool or hear beside we may have lying by our sides our lovely lasses or bright shining brides we be not tied to wilful chastity but have the gospel of free liberty by that he ended had his ghostly sermon the fox was well induced to be a parson and of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire how to a bonefice he might aspire marie there said the priest is art indeed much good deep learning one thereout may reed for that the groundwork is and end of all how to obtain a beneficial first therefore when you have in handsome wise your self attired as you can devise then to some noble man your self apply or other great one in the world's eye that hath a zealous disposition to god and so to his religion there must thou fashion eke a godly zeal such as no carpers may contrayre reveal for each thing feigned ought more wary be there thou must walk in sober gravity and seem as saintlike as saint radegund fast much pray oft look lowly on the ground and unto every one do courtesy meek these looks nought saying do a benefice seek and be thou sure one not to lack or long but if thee list unto the court to throng and there to hunt after the hoped prey then must thou thee dispose another way for there thou needs must learn to laugh to lie to face to forge to scoff to company to crouch to please to be a beetle stock of thy great maters will to scorn or mock so mayest thou chance mock out a benefice unless thou canst one coniute by device or cast a figure for a bishopric and if one could it were but a shoole trick these be the ways by which without reward livings in court be got though full hard for nothing there is done without a fee the courtier needs must recompensed be with a benevolence or have in gage the primitias of your parsonage scarce can a bishopric forpas them by but that it must be gelded in privity doo no thou therefore seek a living there but of more private persons seek elsewhere whereas thou mayest compound a better penny ne let thy learning questioned be of any for some good gentleman that hath the right unto his church for to present a wight will cope with thee in reasonable wise that if the living yearly do arise to fortie pound that then his youngest son shall twentie have and twentie thou hast won thou hast it won for it is of frank gift and he will care for all the rest to shift both that the bishop may admit of thee and that therein thou mayest maintained be this is the way for one that is unlearned living to get and not to be discerned but they that are great clerks have nearer ways for learning sake to living them to raise yet many eke of them god wot are driven taccept a benefice in pieces riven how sayest thou friend have i not well discoursed upon this common place though plain not wourst better a short tale than a bad long shriving needs any more to learn to get a living now sure and by my hallidome quoth he you a great master are in your degree great thanks i yield you for your discipline and do not doubt but duly to incline my wits thereto as you shall shortly hear the priest him wished good speed and well to fare so parted they as either's way them led but th'ape and fox ere long so well them sped through the priests wholesome counsel lately taught and through their own fair handling wisely wrought that they a benefice betwixt them obtained and crafty reynold was a priest ordained and th'ape his parish clarke procured to be then made they revel rout and goodly glee but ere long time had passed they so ill did order their affairs that evil will of all their parishioners they had constrained who to the ordinary of them complained how foully they their offices abused and them of crimes and heresies accused ' that pursuivants he often for them sent but they neglected his commandment so long persisted obstinate and bold till at the length he published to hold a visitation and them cited thither then was high time their wits about to gather what did they then but made a composition with their next neighbour priest for light condition to whom their living they resigned quite for a few pence and ran away by night so passing through the country in disguise they fled far off where none might them surprise and after that long strayed here and there through every field and forest far and never yet never found occasion for their turn but almost starved did much lament and mourn at last they chanced to meet upon the way the mule all decked in goodly rich array with bells' and boss's that full loudly rung and costly trappings that to ground down hung lowly they him saluted in meek wise but he through pride and fatness gan despise their meanness scarce vouchsafte them to requite whereat the fox deep groaning in his sprite said ah sir mule now blessed be the day that i see you so goodly and so gay in your attires and eke your silken hide filled with round flesh that every bone does hide seems that in fruitful pastures you do live or fortune does you secret favour give foolish fox said the mule thy wretched need praiseth the thing that does thy sorrow breed for well i ween thou canst not but envy my wealth compared to thine own misery that art so lean and meager waxed late that scarce thy legs uphold thy feeble gate ay me said then the fox whom evil hap unworthy in such wretchedness does wrap and makes the scorn of other beasts to be but read fair sir of grace from whence come ye or what of tidings you abroad do hear news may perhaps some good unweeting bear from royal court i lately came said he where all the bravery that eye may see and all the happiness that heart desire is to be found he nothing can admire that hath not seen that heavens portracture but tidings there is none i you assure save that which common is and known to all that courtiers as the tide do rise and fallen but tell us said the ape we do you pray who now in court does bear the greatest sway that if such fortune do to us befall we may seek favour of the best of all marie said he the highest now in grace be the wild beasts that swiftest are in chase for in their speedy course and nimble flight the lion now does take the most delight but chiefly joys on foot them to behold enchaste with chain and ciculet of gold so wild a beast so tame ytaught to be and buxom to his bans is joy to see so well his golden circlet him beseems but his late chain his liege unmeet esteems for so brave beasts she loves best to see in the wild forest ranging fresh and free therefore if fortune thee in court to live in case thou ever there wilt hope to thrive to some of these thou must thy self apply else as a thistledown in the does fly so vainly shalt thou too and from be tossed and lose thy labour and thy fruitless cost and yet full few which follow them i see for virtues bore regard advanced be but either for some gainful benefit or that they may for their own turns be fit nevertheless perhaps you things may handle so that you may better thrive than thousands more but said the ape how shall we first come in that after we may favour seek to win how else said he but with a good bold face and with big words and with a stately pace that men may think of you in general that to be in you which is not all for not by that which is the world now deemeth as it was wont but by that same that seems ne do i doubt but that you well can fashion your selves thereto according to occasion so fare you well good courtiers may you be so proudly neighing from them parted he then gan this crafty couple to devise how for the court themselves they might aguize for thither they themselves meant to address in hope to find there happier success so well they shifted that the ape anon himself had clothed like a gentleman and the sly fox as like to be his groom that to the court in seemly sort they come where the found ape himself uprearing high upon his tiptoes stalketh stately by as if he were some great magnifico and boldly does among the boldest go and his man reynold with fine counterfeisance supports his credit and his countenance then gan the courtiers gaze on eerie side and stare on him with big looks basen wide wondering what mister wight he was and whence for he was clad in strange accoutrements fashioned with quaint devises never seen in court before yet there all fashions been yet he them in new fangleness did pass but his behaviour altogether was alla turchesca much the more admired and his looks lofty as if he aspire to dignity and disdained the low degree that all which did such strangeness in him see by secret means gan of his state inquire and privily his servant thereto hire who thoroughly armed against such coverture reported unto all that he was sure a noble gentleman of high regard which through the world had with long travel fared and seen the manners of all beasts on ground now here arrived to see if like he found thus did the ape at first him credit gain which afterwards he wisely did maintain with gallant show and daily more augment through his fine feats and courtly compliment for he could play and dance and vault and spring and all that else pertains to reveling only through kindly aptness of his joints beside he could do many other points the which in court him served to good stead for he amongst ladies could their fortune's read out of their hands and merry leasings tell and juggle finely that became him well but he so light was at legier demaine that what he touched came not to light again yet would he laugh it out and proudly look and tell them that they greatly him mistook so would he scoff them out with mockery for he therein had great felicity and with sharp quips joyed others to deface thinking that their disgracing did him grace so while that other like vain wits he pleased and made to laugh his heart was greatly eased but the right gentle mind would bite his lip to hear the iauell so good men to nip for though the vulgar yield and open ear and common courtiers love to gibe and fleare at every thing which they hear spoken ill and the best speeches with ill meaning spill yet the brave courtier in whose beauteous thought regard of honour harbours more than ought does loath such base condition to backbite anies good name for envy or despite he stands on terms of honourable mind ne will be carried with the common wind of courts inconstant mutability ne after every tattling fable fly but hears and sees the follies of the rest and thereof gathers for himself the best he will not creep nor crouch with feigned face but walks upright with comely steadfast pace and unto all does yield due courtesy but not with kissed hand below the knee as that same apish crew is wont to do for he disdains himself embase thereto he hates owl leasings and vile flattery two filthy blots in noble gentry and lothefull idleness he does deest the canker worm of every gentle breast the which to banish with fair exercie of knightly feats he daily does duise now managing the mouths of stubborn steeds now practising the proof of warlike deeds now his bright arms assaying now his spear now the nigh aimed ring away to bear at other times he casts to sew the chase of swift wild beasts or run on foot a raze t'enlarge his breath large breath in arms most needful or else by wrestling to wex strong and heedful or his stiff arms to stretch with eughen bow and manly legs still passing too and from without a gowned beast him fast beside a vain ensample of the persian pride who after he had won th'assyrian foe did ever after scorn on foot to go thus when this coutly gentleman with toil himself hath wearied he does recoil unto his rest and there with sweet delight of musics skill revives his toiled spright or else with loves and ladies gentle sports the joy of youth himself he recomforts or lastly when the body list to pause his mind unto the muses he withdraws sweet lady muses ladies of delight delights of life and ornaments of light with whom he close confers with wise discourse of nature's works of heavens continual course of foreign lands of people different of kingdoms change of diverse government of dreadful battles of renowned knights with which he kindleth his ambitious sprights to like desire and praise of noble fame the only upshot whereto he does aim for all his mind on honour fixed is to which he levels all his purposis and in his princes eruice spends his days not so much for to gain or for to raise himself to high degree as for his grace and in his liking to win worthy place through due deserts and comely carriage in whatso please employ his personage that may be matter meet to gain him praise for he is fit to use in all assays whither for arms and warlike amenance or else for wise and civil governance for he is practised well in policy and thereto does his courting mote apply to learn the enterdeal of princes strange to mark intent of counsels and the change of states and eke of private men somewhile supplated by fine falsehood and fair guile of all the which he gathereth what is fit enrich the storehouse of his powerful wit which through wise speeches and graven conference he daily eekes and brings to excellence such is the rightful courtier in his kind but unto such the ape lent not his mind such were for him no fit companions such would descry his lewd conditions but the young lusty gallants he did chosen to follow meet to whom he might disclose his witless pleasance and ill pleasing vain a thousand ways he them could entertain with all the thriftless games that may be found with mumming and with masking all around with dice with cards with balliards far unfit with shuttelcocks misseeming manly wit with courtesans and costly riotise whereof still somewhat to his share did rise ne them to pleasure would he sometime scorn a pandares coae so basely was he born thereto he could fine loving veres frame and play the poet oft but ah for shame let not sweet poets praise whose only pride is virtue to advance and vice deride be with the work of lozels wit defamed ne let such verses poetry be nam yet he the name on him would rashly take maugre the sacred muses and it make a servant to the vile affection of such as he depended most upon and with the sgrie sweet thereof allure chaste ladies ears to fantasies impure to such delights the noble wits he led which him relieved and their vain humours fed with fruitless follies and unsound delights but if perhaps into their noble sprights desire of honour or brave thought of arms did ever creep then with his wicked charms and strong conceits he would it driven away ne suffer it to house there half a day and whenso love of letters did inspire their gentle wits and kindly wise desire that chiefly does each noble mind adorn then he would scoff at learning and eke scorn the sectaries thereof as people base and simple men which never came in place of world's affairs but in dark corners mewd muttered of matters as their books them showed ne other knowledge ever did attain but with their gowns their gravity maintain from them he would his impudent lewd speech against gods holy ministers oft reach and mock divines and their proession what else then did he by progression but mock high god himself whom they profess but what cared he for god or godliness all his care was himself how to advance and to uphold his courtly countenance by all the cunning means he could devise were it by honest ways or otherwise he made small choice yet sure his honesty got him small gains but shameless flattery and filthy brocage and unseemly shifts and borrow base and some good ladies gifts but the best help which chiefly him sustained was his man raynolds purchase which he gained for he was schooled by kind in all the skill of close conveyance and each practice ill of coosinage and cleanly knavery which oft maintained his master's bravery beside he used another slippery slight in taking on himself in common sighed false personages fit for every stead with which he thousands cleanly coosined now like a merchant merchant's to deceive with whom his credit he did often leave in gage for his gay master's hopeless debt now like a lawyer when he land would let or fell fee-simples in his master's name which he had never nor ought like the same then would he be a broker and draw in both wares and money by exchange to win then would he seem a farmer that would fell bargains of woods which he did lately fell or corn or cattle or such other ware thereby to cousin men not well aware of all the which there came a secret fee to th'ape that he his countenance might be beside all this he used ' oft to beguile poor suitors that in court did haunt some while for he would learn their business secretly and then inform his master hastily that he by means might cast them to prevent and beg the suit the which the other meant or otherwise false reynold would abuse the simple suitor and wish him to choose his master being one of great regard in court to compass any suit not hard in case his pains were recompensed with reason so would he work the silly man by treason to buy his master's frivolous good will that had not power to do him good or ill so pitiful a thing is suitors state most misrable man whom wicked fate hath brought to court to sue for had ywist that few have found and many one hath missed full little knowest thou that hast not tried what hell it is in suing long to bide to lose good days that might be better spent to wast long nights in pensive discontent to speed to day to be put back to morrow to feed on hope to pine with fear and sorrow to have thy princes grace yet want her peers to have thy asking yet wait many years to fret thy soul with crosses and with cares to eat thy heart through comfortless despairs to fawn to crowche to wait to ride to run to spend to give to want to be undone unhappy wight born to disastrous end that does his life in so long tendance spend who ever leaves sweet home where mean estate in safe assurance without strife or hate finds all things needful for contentment meek and will to court for shadows vain to seek or hope to gain himself will a daw try that curse god send unto mine enemy for none but such as this bold ape unblest can ever thrive in that unlucky quest or such as hath a reynold to his man that by his shifts his master furnish can but yet this fox could not so closely hide his crafty feats but that they were descried at length by such as sat in justice seat who for the same him foully did entreat and having worthily him punished out of the court for ever banished and now the ape wanting his huckster man that wont provide his necessaries gan to grow into great lack n could uphold his countenance in those his garments old ne new ones could he easily provide though all men him uncased gan deride like as a puppit placed in a play whose part once passed all men bid take away so that he driven was to great distress and shortly brought to hopeless wretchedness then closely as he might he cast to leave the court not asking any pass or leave but ran away in his rend rags by night ne ever stayed in place ne spoke to wight till that the fox his copesmate he had found to whom complaining his vnappy stound at last again with him in travel joined and with him fared some better chance to find so in the world long time they wandered and much want and hardness suffered that them repented much so foolishly to come so far to seek for misery and leave the sweetness of contented home though eating hips and drinking watery foam thus as they them complained too and from while through the forest rechlesse they did go lo where they spied how in a gloomy glade the lion sleeping lay in secret shade his crown and sceptre lying him beside and having dot for heat his dreadful hide which when they saw the ape was soar afraid and would have fled with terror all dismayed but him the fox with hardy words did stay and bade him put all cowardice away for now was time if ever they would hope to aim their counsels to the fairest scope and them for ever highly to advance in case the good which their own happy chance them freely offered they would wisely take scarce could the ape yet speak so did he quake yet as he could he asked how good might grow where nought but dread & death do seem in show now said he while the lion sleepeth found may we his crown and mace take from the ground and eke his skin the terror of the wood wherewith we may our selves if we think good make kings of beasts and lrds of forests all subject unto that pour imperial ah but said the ape who is so bold a wretch that dare his hardy hand to those outstretch when as he knows his meed if he be spied to be a thousand deaths and shame beside found ape said then the fox into whose breast never crept thought of honour nor brave gest who will not venture life a king to be and rather rule and reign in sovereign see than dwell in dust inglorious and base where none shall name the number of his place one joyous hour in blissful happiness i chosen before a life of wretchedness be therefore counseled herein by me and shake off this vile hearted cowardree if he awake yet is not death the next for we may colour it with some pretext of this or that that may excuse the crime else we may fly thou to a tree mayest climb and i creep under ground both from his reach therefore be ruled to do as i do teach the ape that erst did nought but chill and quake now gan some courage unto him to take and was content to attempt that enterprise tickled with glory and rash covetise but first gan question whither should assay those royal ornaments to steal away marie that shall your self quoth he thereto for you be fine and nimble it to do of all the beasts which in the forests be is not a fitter for this turn than ye therefore mine own deer brother take good heart and ever think a kingdom is your part loath was the ape though praised to adventer yet faintly gan into his work to enter afraid of every leaf that stirred him by and every stick that vnderneah did lie upon his tiptoes nicely he up went for making noise and still his ear he lent to every found that under heaven blew now went now step now crept now backward drew that it good sport had been him to have eyed yet at the last so well he him applied through his fine handling and cleanly play he all those royal signs had stolen away and with the foxes help them born aside into a secret corner unespied whither whenas they came they fell at words whither of them should be the lord of lords for th'ape was strifeful and ambitious and the fox guileful and most covetous that neither pleased was to have the rain betwixt them divided into even twaine but either algates would be lords alone for love and lordship bide no paragon i am most worthy said the ape sith i for it did put my life in jeopardy thereto i am in person and in stature most like a man the lord of every creature so that it seems i was made to reign and born to be a kingly sovereign nay said the fox sir ape you are astray for though to steal the diadem away were the work of your nimble hand yet i did first devise the plot by policy so that it wholly springs from my wit for which also i claim my self more fit than you to rule for government of stte will without wisdom soon be ruinate and where you claim your self for outward shape most like a man man is not like and ape in his chief parts that is in wit and spirit but i therein most like to him do merit for my lie wiles and subtle craftiness the title of the kingdom to possess nevertheless my brother since we passed are unto this point we will appease our jar and i with reason meet will rest content that you shall have both crown and government upon condition that you ruled bee in all affairs and counseled by me and that you let none other ever draw your mind from me but keep this as a law and hereupon and oath unto me plighted the ape was glad to end the strife so light and thereto swore for who would not oft swear and oft unswear a diadem to bear then freely up those royal spoils he took yet at that lyons skin he lie quaked but it dissembled and upon his head the crown and on his back the skin he did and the false fox him helped to array then when he was all dight he took his way into the forest that he might be seen of the wild beasts in his new glory sheen there the two first whom he encountered were the sheep and th'asse who stricken both with fear at sighed of him gan fast away to fly but unto them the fox aloud did cry and in the kings name bade them both to stay upon the pain that thereof follow may hardly naythles were they restrained so till that the fox forth towards them did go and there dissuaded them from needless fear for that the king did favour to them bear and therefore dreadless bade them come to corte for no wild beasts should do them any torte there or abroad ne would his majesty use them but well with gracious clemency as whom he knew to him both fast and true so he persuaded them with homage endue themselves to humble to the ape prostrate who gently to them bowing in his gate received them with cheerful entertain thenceforth proceeding with his princely train he shortly met the tiger and the boar which with the simple camel raged soar in bitter words seeking to take occasion upon his fleshly corpse to make invasion but soon as they this mock-king did espy their troublous strife they stinted by and by thinking indeed that it the lion was he then to prove whither his pour would pass as currant sent the fox to them straight way commanding them their cave of srife bewray and if that wrong on either side there were that he should warn the wronger to appear the morrow next at court it o defend in the mean time upon the king t'attend the subtle fox so well his message said that the proud beasts him readily obeyed whereby the ape in wondrous stomach wox strongly encouraged by the crafty fox that king indeed himself he shortly thought and all the beasts him feared as they ought and followed unto his palace high where taking couge each one by and by departed to his home in dreadful awe full of the feared sighed which late they saw the ape thus seized of the regal throne eftsoon by counsel of the fox alone gan to provide for all things in assurance that so his rule might longer have endurance first to his gate he pointed a strong guard that none might enter but with issue hard then for the safeguard of his personage he did appoint a warlike equipage of foreign beasts not in the forest bred but part by land and part by water fed for tyranny is with strange aid supported then unto him all monstrous beasts resorted bred of two kinds as griffons minotaures crocodiles dragons beavers and centaur's with those himself he strengthened mightily that fear he need no force of enemy then gan he rule and tyrannise at will like as the fox did guide his graceless skill and all wild beasts made vassals of his pleasures and with their spoils enlarged his private treasures no care of justice nor no rule of reason no temperance nor no regard of season did thenceforth ever enter in his mind but cruelty the sign of currish kind and sdainful pride and wilful arrogance such follows those whom fortune does advance but the false fox most kindly played his part for whatsoever mother wit or art could work he put in proof no practice sly no counterpoint of cunning policy no reach no breach that might him profit bring but he the same did to his purpose wring nought suffered he the ape to give or grant but through his hand must pass the faunt all offices all leases by him leapt and of them all whatso he liked he kept justice he sold injustice for to buy and for to purchase for his progeny ill might it prosper that ill got was but so he god it little did he pass he fed his cubs with fat of all the soil and with the sweet of others sweating toil he crammed them with crumbs of benefices and filled their mouths with meeds of malefices he clothed them with all colours save white and loaded them with lordship's and with might so much as they were able well to bear that with the weight their backs nigh broken were he chaffered chairs in which churchmen were set and breach of laws to privy ferme did let no statute so established might be nor ordinance so needful but that he would violate though not with violence yet under colour of the confidence the which the ape reposed ' in him alone and reckoned him the kingdoms corner stone and ever when he ought would bring to pass his long experience the platform was and when he ought not pleasing would put by the cloak was care of thrift and husbandry for to increase the common treasures store but his own treasure he increased more and lifted up his lofty towers thereby that they began to threat the neighbour sky the while the princes palaces fell fast to ruin or what thing can ever last and whilst the other peers for poverty were forced their ancient houses to let lie and their old castles to the ground to fallen which their forefathers famous over all had founded for the kingdoms ornament and for their memories long monument but he no count made of nobility nor the wild beasts whom arms did glorify the realms chief strength & garland of the crown all these through feigned crimes he thrust adown or made them dwell in darkness of disgrace for none but whom he list might come in place of men of arms he had but small regard but kept them low and streigned very hard for men of learning little he esteemed his wisdom he above their learning deemed as for the rascal commons lest he cared for not so common was his bounty shared let god said he if please care for the many i for my self must care before else any so did he god to no to mani ill so did he all the kingdom rob and pill yet none durst speak ne none durst of him plain so great he was in grace and rich through gain ne would he any let to have access unto the prince but by his own address for all that else did come were sure oh fail yet would he further none but for avail for on a time the sheep to whom of yore the fox had promised of friendship store what time the ape the kingdom first did gain came to the court her case there to complain how that the wolf her mortal enemy had since slain her lamb most cruelly and therefore craved to come unto the king to let him know the order of the thing soft goody sheep then said the fox not so unto the king so rash you may not go he is with greater matter busied than a lamb or the lambs own mother's head ne certes may i take it well in part that you my cousin wolf so foully thwart and seek with slander his good name to blot for there was cause else do it he would not therefore surcease good dame and hence depart so went the sheep away with heavy heart so many more so every one was used that to give largely to the box refused now when high ioue in whose almighty hand the care of kings and power of empires stand sitting one day within his turret high from whence he views with his blacklidded eye whatso the heaven in his wide vault contains and all that in the deepest earth remains and troubled kingdom of wild beasts beheld whom not their kindly sovereign did weld but and usurping ape with guile suborned had all subversed he sdeignfully it scorned in his great heart and hardly did refrain but that with thunder bolts he had him slain and driven down to hell his dewest meed but him advising he that dreadful deed forbore and rather chosen with scornful shame him to avenge and blot his brutish name unto the world that never after any should of his raze be void of infamy and his false counsellor the cause of all to damn to death or dole perpetual from whence he never should be quit nor staled forthwith he mercurie unto him called and bade him fly with never resting speed unto the forest where wild beasts do breed and there inquiring privily to learn what did of late chance to the lion stern that he ruled not the empire as he ought and whence were all those plaints unto him brought of wrongs and spoils by salvage beasts committed which done he bade the lion be remitted into his seat and those same treacherous vile be punished for their presumptuous guile the son of maia soon as he received that word straight with his azure wings he cleaved the liquid clouds and lucid firmament ne stayed till that he came with steep descent unto the place where his prescript did show there stooping like and arrow from a bow he soft arrived on the grassy plain and fairly paced forth with easy pain till that unto the palace nigh he came then gan he to himself new shape to frame and that fair face and that ambrosial hew which wonts to deck the gods immortal crew and beautify the shiny firmament he dost unfit for that rude rabblement so standing by the gates in strange disguise he gan inquire of some in secret wise both of the king and of his government and of the fox and his false blandishment and evermore he herd each one complain of foul abuses both in realm and rain which yet to prove more true he meant to see and and ey-witnes of each thing to be tho on his head his dreadful hat he dight which makes him invisible in sighed and mocks eyes of all the lookers on making them think it but a vision through power of that he runs through enemies swords through power of that he passes through the herds of ravenous wild beasts and does beguile their greedy mouths of the expected spoil through power of that his cunning thieveries he wonts to work that none the same espies and through the power of that he putteth on what shape he list in apparition that on his head he wore and in his hand he took caduceus his snaky wand with which the damned ghosts he governeth and furies rules and tartare tempereth with that he causeth sleep to seize the eyes and fear the hearts of all his enemies and when him list and universal night throughout the world he makes on every wigh as when his sire with alcumena lay thus dight into the court he took his way both through the guard which never him descried and through the watchmen who him never spied thenceforth he passed into each secret part whereas he saw that sorely grieved his heart each place abounding with fowl injuries and filled with treasure racked with robberies each place defiled with blood of guiltless beasts which had been slain to serve the apes behests gluttony malice pride and covetise and lawlesnes reigning with riotise beside the infinite extotions done through the foxes great oppressions that the complaints thereof could not be told which when he did with loathful eyes behold he would no more endure but came his way and cast to seek the lion where he may that he might work the avengement for this shame on those two caitiff's which had bred him blame and seeking all the forest busily at last he found where sleeping he did lie the wicked weed which there the fox did lay from underneath his head he took away and then him waking forced up to rise the lion looking up gan him avise as one late in a trance what had of long become of him for fantasy is strong arise said mercurie thou sluggish beast that here liest senseless like the corpse deceased the whilst thy kingdom from thy head is rend and thy throne royal with dishonour blended arise and do thy self redeem from shame and be avenged on those that breed thy blame thereat enraged soon he gan upstarted grinding his teeth and grating his great art and rouzing up himself for his rough hide he gan to reach but no where it espied therewith he gan full terribly to roar and chafte at that indignity right soar but when his crown and sceptre both he wanted lord how he fumed and swelled and aged and panted and theatned death & thousand deadly dolours to them that had purloined his princely honours with that in haste disrobed as he was he towards his own palace forth did pass and all the way he roared as he wen that all the forest with astonishment thereof did tremble and the beasts therein fled fast away from that so dreadful din at last he came unto his mansion where all the gates he found fast locked anon and many warders round about them stood with that he roared aloud as he were wood that all the palace quaked at the stound as if it quite were riven from the ground and all within were dead and hartles let and th'ape himself as one whose wits were rest fled here and there and every corner sought to hide himself from his own feared thought but the false fox when he the lion herd fled closely forth straightway of death aeard and to the lion came ull lowly creeping with feigned face and watery eyes half weeping excuse his former treason and abusion and turning all unto the apes confusion nevertheless the royal beast forbore believing but bade him stay at ease till further preeuing then when he saw no entrance to him granted roaring yet louder that all hearts it daunted upon those gates with force he fiercely flew and rending them in pieces felly slew those warders strange and all that else he met but th'ape still flying he no where might get from room to room from beam to beam he fled all breathless and for fear now almost dead yet him at last the lion spied and caught and forth with shame unto his judgement brought then all the beasts he caused ' assembled be to hear their doom and sad ensample see the fox first author of that treachery he did uncase and then away let fly but th'apes long tail which then he had he quite cut off and both ears pared of their hight since which all apes but half their ears have left and of their tails are utterly bereft so mother hubberd hr discourse did end which pardon me if i amiss have pend for weak was my remembrance it to hold

room in ashes is entombed and her great spirit rejoined to the spirit of this great mass is in the same enwombed but her brave writings which her famous merit in spite of time out of the dust does rear do make her idol through the world appear 6 such as the berecynthian goddess bright in her swift chariot with high turrets crowned proud that so many gods she brought to light such was this city in her good days found this city more than that great phrygian mother renowned for fruit of famous progeny whose greatness by the greatness of none other but by her self her equal match could see room

having all parts in their power nought from the roman empire might be quite and that though time does cōmonwealths devour yet no time should so low embase their hight that her head earthed in her foundations deep should not her name and endless honour keep 9 the cruel stars and eke you gods unkind heaven envious and bitter stepdame nature be it by fortune or by course of kind that you do wielded affairs of earthly creature why have your hands long since traveled to frame this world that does endure so long or why were not these roman palaces made of some matter no less firm and strong i say not as the common voice does say that all things which beneath the moon have being are temporal and subject to decay but i say rather though not all agreeing with some that ween the contrary in thought that all this whole shall one day come to nought 10 as that brave son of aeson which by charms achieved the golden fleece in colchid land out of the earth engendered men of arms of dragons teeth sown in the sacred sand so this brave town that in her youthly days and hydra was of warriors glorious did fill with her renowned nurselings praise the firy suns both one and other house but they at last there being then not living and hercules so rank seed to repress amongst themselves with cruel fury striving mowed down themselves with slaughter merciless renewing in themselves that

all so did that haughty front which happed was on these seuen roman hills it self uprear over the world and lift her lofty face against the heaven that gan her force to fear but now these scored fields bemoan her fallen and gods ecure fear not her force at all 13 nor the swift fury of to flames aspiring nor the deep wounds of victor's raging blade nor ruthless spoil of soldiers blood-desiring the which so of thee rome their conquest made ne stroke on stroke of fortune variable ne rust of age hating continuance nor wrath of gods nor spite of men unstable nor thou opposed ' againt thine own puissance nor horrible uproar of winds high blowing nor swelling streams of that god makie paced which hath so oaten with his overflowing thee drenched have thy pride so much abased but that this nothing which they have thee left makes the world wonder what they from thee reft 14 as men in summerfearles pass the soord which is in winter lord of all the plain and with his tumbling streams does bear aboard the ploughman's hope and shepherds labour vain and as the coward beasts use to despise the noble lion after his lives end whetting their teeth and with vain foolhardise daring the foe that cannot him defend and as at troy most dastards oh the greeks did brave about the corpses of hector cold so those which whilom wot with pallid cheeks the roman triumphs glory to behold now on these ashy tombs show boldness vain and conquered dare the conqueror disdain 15 the pallid spirits and you ashy ghosts which joying in the brightness of your day brought forth those signs of your presumptuous boasts which now their dusty relics do bewray tell me you spirits sith the darksome river of styx not passable to souls returning enclosing you in thrice three wards for ever do not restrain your images still mourning tell me then for perhaps some one of you yet here above him secretly does hide do you not feel your torments to accrewe when you sometime behold the ruined pride of these old roman works built with your hands to become nought else but heaped sands 16 like as you see the wrathful sea from far in a great mountain heaped with hideous noise eftsoons of thousand billows shouldered narre against a rock to break with dreadful poise like as you see fell boreas with sharp blast tossing huge tempests through the troubled sky eftsoons having his wide wings spent in waste to stop his weary career suddenly and as you see huge flames spread diversely gathered in one up to the heavens to spire eftsoons consumed to fallen down feebily so whilom did this monarchy aspire as waves as wind as fire spread over all till it by fatal doom adown did fallen 17 so long as ioues great bird did make his flight bearing the fire with which heaven does us fray heaven had not fear of that presumptuous might with which the giants did the gods assay but all so soon as scorching sun had brent his wings which wont the earth to overspread the earth out of her massy womb forth sent that antique horror which made heaven adredd then was the germane raven in disguise that roman eagle seen to cleave asunder and towards heaven freshly to arise out of these mountains now consumed to powder in which the foul that serves to bear the lightning is now no more seen flying nor alighting 18 these heaps of stones these old walls which you see were first enclosures but of salvage soil and these brave palaces which mastered bee of time were shepherds cottages somewhile then took the shepherds kingly ornament and the stout hind armed his right hand with steel eftsoons their rule of yearly presidents grew great and sixe months greater a great deele which made perpetual rose to so great might that thence imperial eagle rooting took till th'heauen it self opposing gainst her might her power to peters successor betook who shepheardlike as fates the same foreseeing does show that all things turn to their first being 19 all that is perfect which th'heauen beautefies all that's imperfect born below the moon all that does feed our spirits and our eyes and all that does consume our pleasures soon all the mishap the which our days outwears all the good hap of oldest times afore room in the time of her great ancestors like a pandora locked long in store but destiny this huge chaos turmoiling in which all good and evil was enclosed their heavenly virtues from these woes assoiling carried to heaven from sinful bondage losed but their great sins the causers of their pain under these antique ruins yet remain 20 no otherwise than rainy cloud first fed with earthly vapours gathered in the air eftsoons in compass arched to steep his head does plunge himself in tethys bosom fair and mounting up again from whence he came with his great belly spreads the dimmed world till at the last dissolving his moist frame in rain or snow or hail he forth is horld this city which was first but shepherds shade uprising by degrees grew to such height that queen of land and sea her self she made at last not able to bear so great weight her power dispersed through all the world did vade to show that all in th'end to nought shall fade 21 the same which pyrrhus and the puissance of afrike could not tame that same brave city which with stout courage armed against mischance sustained the shock of common enmity long as her ship tossed with so many freaks had all the world in arms against her bent was never seen that any fortune's wreaks could break her course begun with brave intent but when the object of her virtue failed her power it self against it self did arm as he that having long in tempest sailed fain would arrive but cannot for the storm if too great wind against the port him driven does in the port it self his vessel rive 22 when that brave honour of the latin name which mear her rule with africa and byze with thames inhabitants of noble fame and they which see the dawning day arise her nurselings did with mutinous uproar harten against her self her conquered spoil which she had won from all the world afore of all the world was spoiled within a while so when the compassed course of the universe in sixe and thirtie thousand years is run the bans of th'elements shall back reverse to their first discord and be quite undone the seeds of which all things at first were bred shall in great chaos womb again be hid 23 oh wary wisdom of the man that would that carthage towers from spoil should be forborn to th'end that his victorious people should with cancring laisure not be overworn he well foresaw how that the roman courage impatient of pleasures faint desires through idleness would turn to civil rage and be her self the matter of her fires for in a people given all to ease ambition is engendered easily as in a vicious body grose disease soon grows through humours superfluity that came to pass when swollen with plenties pride nor prince nor peer nor kin they would abide 24 if the blind fury which wars breeds oft wonts not

embued that each to other working cruel wrongs your blades in your own bowels you imbrued was this the romans your hard destiny or some old sin whose unappeased guilt poured vengeance forth on you

the raze of silver-winged flies which do possess the empire of the air betwixt the centred earth and azure skies was none more favourable nor more fair while heaven did favour his felicities then clarion the eldest son and hair of muscaroll and in his father's sighed of all alive did seem the fairest wight with fruitful hope his aged breast he fed of future good which his young towards years full of brave courage and bold hardyhed above ensample of his equal pears did largely promise and to him forered while oft his heart did melt in tender tears that he in time would sure prove such and one as should be worthy of his father's throne the fresh young fly in whom the kindly fire of lustful yonght began to kindle fast did much disdain to subject his desire to loathsome sloth or hours in ease to wast but joyed to range abroad in fresh attire through the wide compass of the airy coast and with unwearied wings each part t'inquire of the wide rule of his renowned sire for he so swift and nimble was of flight that from this lower tract he dared to sty up to the clouds and thence with pinions light to mount aloft unto the crystal sky to view the workmanship of heavens hight whence down descending he along would fly upon the streaming rivers sport to find and oft would dare to tempt the troublous wind so on a summer's day when season mild with gentle calm the world had quieted and high in heaven hyperions fiery child ascending did his beams abroad dispread while all the heavens on lower creatures smiled young clarion with vauntfull lusty head after his guise did cast abroad to fare and thereto gan his furnitures prepare his breastplate first that was of substance pure before his noble heart he firmly bound that might his life from iron death assure and ward his gentle corpses from cruel wound for it by art was framed to endure the bit of baleful steel and bitter stound no less than that which vulcane made to shield achilles life from fate of trojan field and then about his shoulders broad he threw and hairy hide of some wild beast whom he in salvage forest by adventure slew and rest the spoil his ornament to be which spreading all his back with dreadful view made all that him so horrible did see think him alcides with the lyons skin when the naemean conquest he did win upon his head his glistering burganet the which was wrought by wondrous device and curiously engraved he did set the mettle was of rare and passing price not bilbo steel nor brass from corinth fetched nor costly oricalche from strange phoenice but such as could both phoebus arrows ward and hailing darts of heaven beating hard therein two deadly weapons fixed he boar strongly outlaunced towards either side like two sharp spears his enemies to gore like as a warlike brigandine applied to fight lays forth her threatfully pikes afore the engines which in them sad death do hide so did this fly outstretch his fearful horns yet so as him their terror more adorns lastly his shiny wings as silver bright painted with thousand colours passing far all painters skill he did about him dight not half so many sundry colours are in iris bow ne heaven does shine so bright distinguished with many a twinkling star nor iunoes bird in her ey-spotted train so many goodly colours does contain ne may it be withouten peril spoken the archer god the son of cytheree that joys on wretched

spring when flowers do cloth the fruitful ground walking abroad with all her nymphs to play bade her fair damsels flocking her around to gather flowers her forehead to array amongst the rest a gentle nymph was found hight astery excelling all the crew in courteous usage and unstained hew who being nimbler jointed than the rest and more industrious gathered more store of the fields honour than the others best which they in secret hearts envying soar told venus when her as the worthiest she praised ' that cupide as they herd before did lend her secret aid in gathering into her lap the children of the spring whereof the goddess gathering jealous fear not yet unmindful how not long ago her son to psyche secret love did bear and long it close concealed till much woe thereof arose and many a rueful tear reason with sudden rage did overgo and giving hasty credit to accuser was led away of them that did abuse her eftsoones that damsel by her heavenly might she turned into a winged butterfly in the wide air to make her wandering flight and all those flowers with which so plenteously her lap she filled had that bred her spite she placed in her wings for memory of her pretended crime though crime none were since which that fly them in her wings does bear thus the fresh clarion being ready dight unto his journey did himself address and with good speed began to take his flight over the fields in his frank lustiness and all the champion he soared light and all the country wide he did possess feeding upon their pleasures bounteously that none gainsaid nor none did him envy the woods the rivers and the meadows green with his aire-cutting wings he measured wide ne did he leave the mountains bore unseen nor the rank grassy fens delights untried but none of these how ever sweet they been more please his fancy nor him cause abide his choicefull sense with every change does flit no common things may please a wavering wit to the gay gardens his unstaid desire him wholly carried to refresh his sprights there lavish nature in her best attire powers forth sweet odours and alluring sights and art with her contending does aspire excel the natural with made delights and all that fair or pleasant may be owned in riotous excess does there abound there he arriving round about does fly from bed to bed from one to other border and takes survey with curious busy eye of every flower and herb there set in order now this now that he tasteth tenderly yet none of them he rudely does disorder ne with his feet their silken leaves deface but pastures on the pleasures of each place and evermore with most variety and change of sweetness for all change is sweet he casts his glutton sense to satisfy now sucking of the sap of herb most meet or of the dew which yet on them does lie now in the same bathing his tender feet and then he percheth on some branch thereby to weather him and his moist wings to dry and then again he turns to his play to spoil the pleasures of that paradise the wholesome saulge and lavender still grey rank smelling rue and cummin good for eyes the roses reigning in the pride of may sharp isope good for green wounds remedies fair marigolds and bees

himself embay and there him rests in riotous suffisance of all his gladfulnes and kingly joyance what more felicity can fallen to creature than to enjoy delight with liberty and to be lord of all the works of nature to rain in th'aire from earth to highest sky to feed on flowers and weeds of glorious feature to take what ever thing does please the eye who rests not pleased with such happiness well

own hand to work thy misery ne may thee help the many hearty vow which thy old sire with sacred piety hath poured forth for thee and altars sprented nought may thee save from heavens avengement it fortuned as heavens had behight that in this garden where young clarion was wont to solace him a wicked wight the foe of fair things author of confusion the shame of nature the bondslave of spite had lately built his hateful mansion and lurking closely in a wait now lay how he might any in his trap betray but when he spied the joyous butterfly in this fair plot displacing too and from fearless of foes and hidden jeopardy lord how he gan for to bestir him though and to his wicked work each part apply his heart did earn against his hated foe and bowels so with rankling poison swelde that scarce the skin the strong contagion held the cause why he this fly so maliced was as in stories it is written found for that his mother which him boar and bred the most fine fingered workwoman on ground arachne by his means was vanquished of pallas and in her own skill confound when she with her for excellence contended that wrought her shame and sorrow never ended for the tritonian goddess having heard her blazed fame which all the world had filled came down to prove the truth and due reward for her praiseworthy workmanship to yield but the presumptuous damsel rashly dared the goddess self to challenge to the field and to compare with her in curious skill of works with loom with needle and with quill minerua did the challenge not refuse but deigned with her the paragon to make so to their work they fit and each does choose what story she will or her tapet take arachne figured how ioue did abuse europa like a bull and on his back her through the sea did bear so lively seen that it true sea and true bull you would ween she seemed still back unto the land to look and her play-fellows aid to call and fear the dashing of the waves that up she took her dainty feet and garments gathered near but lord how she in every member shook when as the land she saw no more appear but a wild wilderness of waters deep then gan she greatly to lament and weep before the bull she pictured winged love with his young brother sport light fluttering upon the waves as each had been a dove the one his bow and shafts the other sping a burning teade about his head did move as in their sires new love both triumphing and many nymphs about them flocking round and many tritons which their horns did found and round about her work she did impale with a fair border wrought of sundry flowers enwoen with and ivy winding trail a goodly work full fit for kingly bowers such as dame pallas such as enue pale that all good things with venomous tooth devours could not accuse then gan the goddess bright her self likewise unto her work to dight she made the story of the old debate which she with neptune did for athens try twelue gods do fit around in royal state and ioue in midst with awful majesty to judge the strife between them stirred late each of the gods by his like visnomy eathe to be known but ioue above them all by his great looks and power imperial before them stands the god of seas in place claiming that seacoast city as his right and strikes the rocks with his three-forked mace whenceforth issues a warlike steed in sighed the sign by which he challenges the place that all the gods which saw his wondrous might did surely deem the victory his due but seldom seen foreiugement proves true then to her self she gives her aegide shield and steelhed spear and morion on her head such as she oft is seen in warlike field then sets she forth how with her weapon dreaded she smote the ground the which straight forth did yield a fruitful olive tree with berries spread that all the gods admired then all the story she compassed with a wreathe of olives hoary amongst those leaves she made a butterfly with excellent device and wondrous slight fluttering among the olives wantonly that seemed to live so like it was in sighed the velvet nap which on his wings does lie the silken down with which his back is dight his broad outstretched horns his hairy thighs his glorious colours and his glistering eyes which when arachne saw as overlaid and mastered with workmanship so rare she stood astonished long ne ought gainsaid and with fast fixed eyes on her did stare and by her silence sign of one dismayed the victory did yield her as her share yet did she inly fret and felly burn and all her blood to poisonous rancour turn that shortly from the shape of womanhood such as she was when pallas she attempted she grew to hideous shape of dryrihed pined with grief of folly late repented eftsoons her white straight legs were altered to crooked crawling shanks of marrow empted and her fair face to fowl and loathsome hew and her fine corpses to a bag of venom grew this cursed creature mindful of that old enfested grudge the which his mother felt so soon as clarion he did behold his heart with vengeful malice inly swelled and weaving straight a net with many a fold about the cave in which he lurking dwelled with fine small cords about it stretched wide so finely spun that scarce they could be spied not any damosel which her vaunteth most in skilful knitting of soft silken twine nor any weaver which his work does boast in dieper in damask or in line nor any skilled in workmanship embossed nor any skilled in loupes of figring fine might in their diverse cunning ever dare with this so curious network to compare ne do i think that that same subtle gin the which the lemnian god framed craftily mars sleeping with his wife to compass in that all the gods with common mockery might laugh at them and scorn their shameful since was like to this this same he did apply for to entrap the careless clarion that ranged each where without suspicion suspicion of friend nor fear of foe that hazarded his health had he at all but walked at will and wandered too and from in the pride of his freedom principal little wist he his fatal future woe but was secure the liker he to fallen he likest is to fallen into mischance that is regardless of his governance yet still aragnoll so his foe was hight lay lurking covertly him to surprie and all his begins that him entangle might dressed in good order as he could devise at length the foolish fly without foresight as he that did all danger quite despise towards thoss parts came flying carelelie where hidden was his hateful enemy who seeing him with secret joy therefore did tickle in wardly in every vain and his false heart fraught with all treasons store was filled with hope his purpose to obtain himself he close upgathered more and more into his den that his deceitful train by his there being might not be bewrayed ne any noise ne any motion made like as a wily fox that having spied where on a sunny bank the lambs do play full closely creeping by the hinder side lies in ambushment of his hoped prey ne stirs limb till seeing ready tide he rushes forth and snatches quite away one of the little younglings unawares so to his work aragnoll him prepares who now shall give unto my heavy eyes a well of tears that all may overflow or where shall i find lamentable cries and mournful unes enough my grief to show help o thou tragic muse me to devise notes sad enough express this bitter throw for lo the dreary stound is now arrived that of all happiness hath us deprived the luckless clarion whither cruel fate or wicked fortune faules him misled or some ungracious blast out of the gate of aeoles rain perforce him drove on head was oh sad hap and hour unfortunate with violent swift flight forth carried into the cursed cobweb which his foe had framed for his final ouerhroe there the found fly entangled trugled long himself to free thereout but all in vain for striving more the more in laces strong himself he tide and wrapped his wings twaine in lymie snares the subtle loupes among that in the end he breathelesse did remain and all his yougthly forces idly spent him to the mercy of avenger lent which when the greisly tyrant did espy like a grim lion rushing with fierce might out of his den he seized greedily on the resistless prey and with fell spite under the left wing stroke his weapon sly into his heart that his deep groaning spright in bloody streams forth fled into the air his body left the spectacle of care finis visions of the world's vanity 1 one day while that my daily cares did sleep my spirit shaking off her earthly prison began to entr into meditation deep of things exceeding reach of common reason such as this age in which all good is geason and all that humble is and mean debaced hath brought forth in her last declining season grief of good minds to see goodness disgraced on which when as my thought was throghly placed unto my eyes strange shows presented were picturing that which i in mind embraced that yet those sights empassion me full never such as they were fair lady take in worth that when time serves may bring things better forth 2 in summer's day when phoebus fairly shone i saw a bull as white as driven snow with gilded horns embowed like the moon in a fresh flowering meadow lying low up to his ears the verdant grass did grow and the gay flowers did offer to be eaten but he with fatness so did overflow that he all wallowed in the weeds down beaten ne cared with them his dainty lips to sweeten till that a brize a scorned little creature through his fair hide his angry sting did threaten and vexed so soar that all his goodly feature and all his plenteous pasture nought him pleased so by the small the great is oft diseased 3 beside the fruitful shore of muddy nile upon a sunny bank outstretched lay in monstrous length a mighty crocodile that cramed with guiltless blood and greedy prey of wretched people travailing that way thought all things less than his disdainful pride i saw a little bird called tedula the least of thousands which on earth abide that forced this hideous beast to open wide the greisly gates of his devouring hell and let him feed as nature does provide upon his jaws that with black venom swell why then should greatest things the least disdain sith that so small so mighty can constrain 4 the kingly bird that bears ioues thunderclap one day did scorn the simple scarabee proud of his highest service and good hap that made all other fowls his thralls to be the silly fly that no redress did see spied where the eagle built his towering nest and kindling fire within the hollow tree burned up his young ones and himself distressed ne suffered him in any place to rest but drove in ioues own lap his eggs to lay where gathering also filth him to infest forced with the filth his eggs to fling away for which when as the foul was wroth said ioue lo how the least the greatest may reprove 5 towards the sea turning my troubled eye i saw the fish if fish i may it cleepe that makes the sea before his face to fly and with his flaggy fins does seem to sweep the fomie waves out of the dreadful deep the huge leuiathan dame nature's wonder making his sport that many makes to weep a swordfish small him from the rest did sunder that in his throat him pricking softly under his wide abyss him forced forth to spew that all the sea did roar like heavens thunder and all the waves were stained with filthy hew hereby i learned have not to despise what ever thing seems small in common eyes 6 and hideous dragon dreadful to behold whose back was armed against the dint of spear with shields of brass that shone like burnished gold and forkhed sting that death in it did beae strove with a spider his unequal pear and bad defiance to his enemy the subtle vermin creeping closely near did in his drink shed poison privily which through his entrails spreading diversely made him to swell that nigh his bowels burst and him inforced to yield the victory that did so much in his own greatness trust o how great vainness is it then to scorn the weak that hath the strong so oft folorne 7 high on a hill a goodly cedar grew of wondrous length and straight proportion that far abroad her dainty odours threw amongst all the daughters of proud libanon her match in beauty was not any one shortly within her inmost pith there bred a little wicked worm perceived of none that on her sap and vital moisture fed thenceforth her garland so much honoured began to die oh great ruth for the same and her fair locks fell from her lofty head that shortly bald and bared she became i which this sighed beheld was much dismayed to see so goodly thing so soon decayed 8 soon after this i saw and elephant adorned with bells' and boss's gorgeously that on his back did bear as batteilant a gilded tower which shone exceedingly that he himself through foolish vanity both for his rich attire and goodly form was puffed up with passing surquedry and shortly gan all other beasts to scorn till that a little ant a silly worm into his nostrils creeping so him pained that casting down his towers he did deform both borrowed pride and native bauie stained let therefore nought that great is therein glory sith so small thing his happiness may vary 9 looking far forth into the ocean wide a goodly ship with banners bravely dight and flag in her topgallant i espied through the main sea making her merry flight fair blew the wind into her bosom right and the heavens looked lovely all the while that she did seem to dance as in delight and at her own felicity did smile all suddenly there clove unto her keel a little fish that men call remora which stopped her course and held her by the heel that wind nor tide could move her thence away strange thing me seems that so small a thing should able be so great and one to wring 10 a mighty lion lord of all the wood having his hunger thoroughly satisfied with prey of beasts and spoil of living blood safe in his dreadless den him thought to hide his sternness was his praise his strength his pride and all his glory in his cruel claws i saw a wasp that fiercely him defied and bade him battle even to his jaws soar he him stung that it the blood forth draws and his proud heart is filled with fretting ire in vain he threats his teeth his tail his paws and from his bloody eyes does sparkle fire that dead himself he wishes for despite so weakest may annoy the most of might 11 what time the roman empire boar the rain of all the world and flourished most in might the nations gan their sovereignty disdain and cast to quit them from their bondage quite so when all shrouded were in silent night the galls were by corrupting of a maid possessed nigh of the capitol through slight had not a goose the treachery bewrayde if then a goose great room from ruin stayed and ioue himself the patron of the place preserved from being to his foes betrayed why do vain men mean things so much deface and in their might repose their most assurance sith nought on earth can challenge log endurance 12 when these sad sights were overpassed and gone my spright was greatly moved in her rest with inward ruth and deer affection to see so great things by so small distressed thenceforth i gan in my engrieved breast to scorn all difference of great and small sith that the greatest often are oppressed and unawares do into danger fallen and you that read these ruins tragical learn by their loss to love the low degree and if that fortune chance you up to call to honours seat forget not what you be for he that of himself is most secure shall find his state most fickle and unsure finis the visions of bellay 1 it was the time when rest soft sliding down from heavens hight into men's heavy eyes in the forgetfulness of sleep does drown the careful thoughts of mortal misery's then did a ghost before mine eyes appear on that great rivers bank that runs by room which calling me by name bade me to rear my looks to heaven whence all good gifts do come and crying loud lo now behold quoth he what under this great temple placed is lo all is nought but flying vanity so i that know this world's inconstancies sith only god surmounts all times decay in god alone my confidence do stay 2 on high hills top i saw a stately frame and hundred cubits high by just assize with hundreth pillars fronting fair the same all wrought with diamond after doric wise nor brick nor marble was the wall in view but shining crystal which from top to base out of her womb a thousand rayons threw one hundred steps of afrike golds enchase gold was the parget and the seeling bright did shine all scaly with great plataeae of gold the floor of jasp and emerald was dight o world's vainesse while thus i did behold and earthquake shook the hill from lowest seat and overthrew this frame with ruin great 3 then did a sharped spire of diamond bright ten feet each way in square appear to me justly proportioned up unto his hight so far as archer might his level see the top thereof a pot did seem to bear made of the mettle which we most do honour and in this golden vessel couched wear the ashes of a mighty emperor upon foure corners of the base were pight to bear the frame foure great lyons of gold a worthy tomb for such a worthy wight alas this world does nought but grievance hold i saw a tempest from the heaven descend which this brave monument with flash did rend 4 i saw raised up on ivory pillows tall whose bases were of richest metals work the chapters alabaster the rises crystal the double front of a triumphal ark on each side purtraid was a victory clad like a nymph that wings of silver wears ad in triumphant chair was set on high the ancient glory of the roman pears no work it seemed of earthly craftsmans wit but rather wrought by his own industry that thunder-dares for ioue his sire does fit let me no more see fair thing under sky sith that mine eyes have seen so fair a sighed with sudden fallen to dust consumed quite 5 then was the fair dodonian tree far seen upon seauen hills to spread his gladsome gleam and conquerors bedecked with his green along the banks of the ausonian stream there many and ancient trophy was addressed and many a spoil and many a goodly show which that brave races greatness did attest that whilom from the trojan blood did flow ranisht i was so rare a thing to view when lo a barbarous troop of clownish foes the honour of these noble boughs down threw under the wedge i herd the tronck to groan and since i saw the root in great disdain a twin of forked trees send forth again 6 i saw a wolf under a rocky cave nursing two whelps i saw her little ones in wanton dalliance the eat to crave while she her neck wreathed from them for the nonce i saw her range abroad to seek her food and roaming through the field with greedy rage t'embrew her teeth & claws with lycia warm blood of the small heards her thirst for to assuage i saw a thousand huntsmen which descended down from the mountains bordering lombardie that with and hundred spears her flank wide rended i saw her on the plain outstretched lie throwing out thousand throbs in her own soil soon on a tree vphanged i saw her spoil 7 i saw the bird that can the sun endure with feeble wings assay to mount on hight by more and more she gan her wings to assure following the esample of her mother's sighed i saw her rise and with a larger flight to pierce the clouds and with wide pinneons to measure the most haughty mountains hight until she reached the gods own mansions there was she lost when sudden i beheld where tumbling through the air in firy fold all flaming down she on the plain was field and soon her body turned to ashes cold i saw the foul that does the lighdispise out of her dust like to a worm arise 8 i saw a river swift whose foamy billows did wash the ground work of and old great walls i saw it covered all with grisly shadows that with black horror did the air appall thereout a strange beast with seuen heads arose the owns and castles under her breast did coure and seemed both milder beasts and fiercer foes alike with equal ravine to devour much was i mazde to see this monsters kind in hundred forms to change his fearful hew when as at length i saw the wrathful wind which blows cold storms burst out of scythian mew that dispersed these clouds and in so short as thought this dreadful shape was vanished to nought 9 then all astoined with this mighty ghost and hideous body big and strong i saw with side long bead and locks down hanging loat stern fce and front full of saturnlike awe who loaning on the belly of a pot poured forth water whose out gushing flood ran bathing all the creakie shore aflot whereon the trojan prince spilled turnus blood and at his feet a bitch will suck did yield to two young babes him left the palm tree stout his right hand did the peaceful olive wield and head with laurel garnished was about sudden both palm and olive fell away and fair green laurel branch did quite decay 10 hard by a rivers side a virgin fair folding her arms to heaven with thousand throbs and outraging her cheeks and golden hair to falling rivers found thus tued her sobs where is quoth she this whilom honoured face where the great glory and the ancient praise in which all world's felicity had place when gods and men my honour up did raise suffisd it not that civil wars me made the whole world's spoil but that this hydra new of hundred hercules to be assaide with seuen heads budding monstrous crimes anew so many neroes and caligulaes out of these crooked shores must daily raise 11 upon and hill a bright flame i did see waving aloft with triple point to sky which like incense of precious cedar tree with balmy odours filled th'ayr far and ie a bird all why well feathered on each wing hereout up to the throne of gods did lie and all the way most pleasant notes did sing while in the smoke she unto heaven did sty of this fair fire the scattered rays forth threw on evey side a thousand shining beams when sudden dropping of a silver due oh grievous chance gan quench those precious flames that it which erst so pleasant sent did yield of nothing now but noyous sulphur smelled 12 i saw a spring out of a rock forth rail as clear as crystal gainst the sunny beams the bottom yellow like the golden grail that bright pactolus washes with his streams it seemed that art and nature had assembled all pleasure there for which men heart could long and there a noise alluring sleep soft trembled of many accords more sweet than mermaids song the seats and benches shone as yuori and hundred nymphs sat side by side about when from nigh hills with hideous outcry a troop of satires in the place did rout which with their villeine feet the stream did ray threw down the seats & drove the nymphs away 13 much richer then that vessel seemed to be which did to that sad florentine appear casting mine eyes far off i chanced to see upon the latin coast herself to rear but suddenly arose a tempest great bearing close envy to these riches rare which gan assail this ship with dreadful threat this ship to which none other might compare and finally the storm impetuous sunk up these riches second unto none within the gulf of greedy nereus i saw both ship and mariners each one and all that treasure drowned in the main but i the ship saw after raised again 14 long having deeply groaned these visions sad i saw a city like unto that same which saw the messenger of tidings glad but that on sand was built the goodly frame it seemed her top the firmament did raise and no less rich than fair right worthy sure if ought here worthy of immortal days or if ought under heaven might firm endure much wondered i to see so fair a wall when from the northern coast a storm arose which breathing fury from his inward gall on all which did against his course oppose into a cloud of dust dispersed in the air the weak foundations of this city fair 15 at length even at the time when morpheus most truly does unto our eyes appear weary to see the heavens still wavering thus i saw typhaeus sister coming near whose head full bravely with a morion hid did seem to match the gods in majesty she by a rivers bank that swift down slid over all the world did raise a trophy high and hundred vanquished kings under her lay with arms bound at their backs in shameful wise while i thus mazed was with great affray i saw the heavens in war against her rise then down she stricken fell with clap of thunder that with great noise i wakte in sudden wonder finis the visions of petrarch formerly translated 1 being one day at my window all alone so many strange things happened me to see as much it grieves m to think thereon at my right hand a hind appeared to me so fair as mote the greatest god delight two eager dogs did her pursue in chase of which the one was black the other white with deadly force so in their cruel raze they pinched the haunches of that gentle beast that at the last and in short time i spied under a rock where she alas oppressed fell to the ground and there untimely died cruel death vanquishing so noble beauty oft makes me wail so hard a destiny 2 after at sea a tall ship did appear made all of ebony and white ivory the sails of gold of silk the tackle were mild was the wind calm seemed the sea to be the sky each where did show full bright and fair with rich treasures this gay ship freighted was but sudden storm did so turmoil the air and tumbled up the sea that she alas strake on a rock that under water lay and perished passed all recovery o how great ruth and sorrowful assay does vex my spirit with perplexity thus in a monent to see lost and drowned so great riches as like cannot be found 3 the heavenly branches did i see arise out of the fresh and lusty laurel tree amid the young green wood of paradise some noble plant i thought my self to see such store of birds therein shrouded were chanting in shade their sundry melody that with their sweetness i was ravished never while on this laurel fixed was mine eye the sky gan every where to overcast and darkened was the welkin all about when sudden flash of heavens fire out braced and rend this royal tree quite by the root which makes me much and ever to complain for no such shadow shall had again 4 within this wood out of a rock did rise a spring of water mildly rumbling down whereto approached not in any wise the homely shepherd nor the ruder clown but many muses and the nymphs withal that sweetly in accord did tune their voice to the soft sounding of the waters fallen that my glad heart thereat did much rejoice but while herein i took my chief delight i saw alas the gaping earth devour the spring the place and all clean out of sighed which yet aggreeues my heart even to this hour and wounds my soul with rueful memory to see such pleasures gone so suddenly 5 i saw a phoenix in the wood alone with purple wings and crest of golden hew strange bird he was whereby i thought anon that of some heavenly wight i had the view until he came unto the broken tree and to the spring that late devoured was what say i more each thing at last we see does pass away the phoenix there alas spying the tree destroyed the water dried himself smote with his beak as in disdain and so forth with in great despite he died that yet my heart burns in exceeding pain for ruth and pity of so hapless plighted o let mine eyes no more see such a sighed 6 at last so fair a lady did i spy that thinking yet on her i burn and quake on herbs and flowers she walked pensively mild but yet love she proudly did forsake white seemed her robes yet woven so they were as snow and gold together had been wrought above the waste a dark cloud shrouded her a stinging serpent by the heel her caught wherewith she languished as the gathered flower and well assured she mounted up to joy alas on earth so nothing does endure but bitter grief and sorrowful annoy which make this life wretched and miserable tossed with storms of fortune variable when i beheld this tickle trustles state of vain world's glory litting too and from and mortal men tossed by troublous fate in restless seas of wretchedness and woe i wish i might this weary life forgo and shortly turn unto my happy rest where my free spirit might not any more be vexed with sights that do her peace molest and you fair lady in whose bounteous bret all heavenly grace and virtue shrined is when you these rhythms do read and view the rest loath this base world and think of heavens bliss and though you be the fairest of gods creatures yet think that death shall spoil your goodly features finis\", \"prothalamion or a spousal verse made by edm. spenser in honovr of the double marriage of the two honourable & virtuous ladies the lady elizabeth and the lady katherine somerset daughters to the right honourable the earl of worcester and espoused to the two worthy gentlemen m. henry gilford and m. william peter esquyers at london printed for vvilliam ponsonby 1596. 1 prothalamion calm was the day and through the trembling air sweet breathing zephyrus did softly play a gentle spirit that lightly did delay hight titans beams which then did glyster fair when i whom sullen care through discontent of my long fruitless stay in princes court and expectation vain of idle hope's which still do fly away like empty shadows did afflict my brain walked forth to ease my pain along the shore of silver streaming themmes whose rutty bank the which his river hemmes was painted all with variable flowers and all the meads adorned with dainty gems fit to deck maidens bowers and crown their paramours against the brydale day which is not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 2 prothalamion there in a meadow by the rivers side a flock of nymphs i chanced to espy all lovely daughters of the flood thereby with goodly greenish locks all lose untied as each had be a bride and each one had a little wicker basket made of fine twigs entrailed curiously in which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket and with fine fingers cropped full feateously the tender stalks on high of every sort which in that meadow grew they gathered some the violet pallid blew the little dazie that at evening closes the virgin lillie and the primrose true with store of vermeil roses to deck their bridegroom's posies against the brydale day which was not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 3 prothalamion with that i saw two swans of goodly hew come softly swimming down along the lee two fairer birds i yet did never see the snow which does the top of pindus strew did never whiter show nor ioue himself when he a swan would be for love of leda whiter did appear yet leda was they say as white as he yet not so white as these nor nothing near so purely white they were that even the gentle stream the which them bore seemed foul to them and bade his billows spare to wet their silken feathers lest they might soil their fair plumes with water not so fair and mar their beauty's bright that shone as heavens light against their brydale day which was not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 4 prothalamion eftsoones the nymphs which now had flowers their fill ran all in haste to see that silver brood as they came floating on the crystal flood whom when they saw they stood amazed still their wondering eyes to fill them seemed they never saw a sighed so fair of fowls so lovely that they sure did deem them heavenly born or to be that same pair which through the sky draw venus silver teem for sure they did not seem to be begotten of any earthly seed but rather angels or of angels breed yet were they bred of somers-heat they say in sweetest season when each flower and weed the earth did fresh array so fresh they seemed as day even as their brydale day which was not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 5 prothalamion then forth they all out of their baskets drew great store of flowers the honour of the field that to the sense did fragrant odours yield all which upon those goodly birds they threw and all the waves did strew that like old peneus waters they did seem when down along by pleasant tempes shore scattered with flowers through thessaly they streeme that they appear through lilies plenteous store like a brides chamber flore two of those nymphs mean while two garlands bound of freshest flowers which in that mead they found the which presenting all in trim array their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned whilst one did sing this lay prepared against that day against their brydale day which was not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 6 prothalamion the gentle birds the world's fair ornament and heavens glory whom this happy hour does lead unto your lovers blissful bower joy may you have and gentle hearts content of your loves couplement and let fair venus that is queen of love with her heart-quelling son upon you smile whose smile they say hath virtue to remove all loves dislike and friendships faulty guile for ever to assoil let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord and blessed plenty wait upon you board and let your bed with pleasures chaste abound that fruitful issue may to you afford which may your foes confound and make your joys redound upon your brydale day which is not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 7 prothalamion so ended she and all the rest around to her redoubled that her under song which said their bridal day should not be long and gentle echo from the neighbour ground their accents did resound so forth those joyous birds did pass along adown the lee that to them murmurde low as he would speak but that he lacked a tonge yet did by signs his glad affection show making his stream run slow and all the foul which in his flood did dwell gan flock about these twaine that did excel the rest so far as cynthia does shend the lesser stars so they enranged well did on those two attend and their best service lend against their wedding day which was not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 8 prothalamion at length they all to merry london came to merry london my most kindly nurse that to me gave this life's first native source though from another place i take my name and house of ancient fame there when they came whereas those bricky towers the which on themmes broad aged back do ride where now the studious lawyers have their bowers there whilom wont the templer knights to bide till they decayed through pride next whereunto there stands a stately place where oft i gained gifts and goodly grace of that great lord which therein wont to dwell whose want too well now feels my freendles case but ah here fits not well old woes but joys to tell against the bridal day which is not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 9 prothalamion yet therein now does lodge a noble peer great englands glory and the world's wide wonder whose dreadful name late through all spaine did thunder and hercules two pillars standing near did make to quake and fear fair branch of honour flower of chivalry that fillest england with thy triumphs fame joy have thou of thy noble victory and endless happiness of thine own name that promises the same that through thy prowess and victorious arms thy country may be freed from foreign harms and great elisaes glorious name may ring through all the world filled with thy wide alarms which some brave muse may sing to ages following upon the brydale day which is not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song 10 prothalamion from those high towers this noble lord issuing like radiant hesper when his golden hair in ocean billows he hath bathed fair descended to the rivers open viewing with a great train ensuing above the rest were goodly to be seen two gentle knights of lovely face and feature beseeming well the bower of any queen with gifts of wit and ornaments of nature fit for so goodly stature that like the twins of ioue they seemed in sighed which deck the baldric of the heavens bright they two forth pacing to the rivers side received those two fair brides their loves delight which at appointed tied each one did make his bride against their brydale day which is not long sweet themmes run softly till i end my song finis\"]\n"
